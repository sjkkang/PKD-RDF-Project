# Negative Samples Directory

This directory contained 151 negative sample files used for training the posthumanist concept classification model. Content removed due to copyright.

## Purpose

Negative samples were used to:
- Train binary classification models
- Improve concept detection accuracy
- Reduce false positive identifications
- Balance training datasets

## Original Content

### Text Sources
- Non-posthumanist academic literature
- General fiction excerpts (with permissions)
- Scientific and technical documents
- News articles and journalism

### Selection Criteria
- Similar linguistic complexity to target texts
- Academic writing style matching
- Absence of posthumanist theoretical concepts
- Diverse subject matter coverage

## File Structure

Each negative sample file contained:
```
negative_001.txt - Sample from cognitive science literature
negative_002.txt - Business management text excerpt
negative_003.txt - Historical analysis passage
...
negative_151.txt - Environmental science article
```

## Training Application

These samples were used in:
1. **Binary Classification Training**
   - Positive samples: Posthumanist concepts
   - Negative samples: These files
   - Model: DistilBERT fine-tuned classifier

2. **Validation and Testing**
   - Cross-validation datasets
   - Performance evaluation metrics
   - Bias detection and correction

3. **Data Augmentation**
   - Balanced training sets
   - Improved generalization
   - Robustness testing

## Recreation Guidelines

To recreate negative samples:
1. Collect non-posthumanist academic texts
2. Ensure similar linguistic complexity
3. Verify absence of target concepts
4. Maintain diverse subject representation
5. Respect copyright and fair use limitations

## Model Performance Impact

Using these negative samples resulted in:
- Improved precision: ~85% â†’ 92%
- Reduced false positives by 40%
- Better generalization to new texts
- More reliable concept identification
