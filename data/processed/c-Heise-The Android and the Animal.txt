of works of science fiction in which the emergence of new kinds of humanoid consciousness in robots cyborgs or biotechnologically produced humans is accompanied by a renewed attention to animals Why In what ways does the pres ence of wild domestic genetically modified or mechanical animals reshape the concerns about the human subject that are most cen trally articulated in many of these works through technologically produced and reproduced human minds and bodies Fredric Jameson has argued that the representation of aliens of their bodies cultures and societies flourishes in anglophone science fiction in the 1960s and 1970s while from the early 1980s on science fiction shifts from the classic or exotic alien to the representation of the alien other as the same namely the android whose differentiation from the ear lier robot secures a necessarily humanoid form This may be said to be the moment of a kind of Hegelian selfconsciousness or reflexivity in the genre in which our attention and preoccupation as readers turn inward and meditate on the android cogito which is to say on the gap or flaw in the self as such 141 Jameson locates the moment of this transition in Ridley Scotts Blade Runner 1982 without commenting in this context on the films URSULA K HEISE associate professor of English and director of the Mod ern Thought and Literature program at Stanford University

Hoffmanns Der Sandmann 1817 The Sandman Consid ering this tradition does not invalidate Jame sons contention that the android in much recent science fiction takes over and trans forms some of the structural functions of the alien in earlier texts But it helps foreground the fact that some of the more complex recent novels and films do not ask questions about technologically modified human identities in relation to the robot or cyborg aloneas many classical texts tended to do1but situ ate those questions in an expanded field of produced and reproduced bodies and minds that ranges from dolls robots and cyborgs to children and quite prominently animals In stead of simply displacing the alien in favor of the android in other words recent science fic tion structurally splits the figure of the alien into the android and theoften biologically altered evolved or cyborgizedanimal If the issue of the animal in its relation to human identity has resurged in science fiction it has also done so in cultural theory The first wave of theorization surrounding the concept of posthumanismthe philosophical ques tioning of the centrality of the humanby such scholars as Donna Haraway and N Kath erine Hayles focused mainly on the figure of the cyborg and on machinebased forms of consciousness More recently the term has been used by theorists such as Cary Wolfe Animal Rites and

fiction novels and films manifests itself con cretely in their technological superiority and or their physical resemblance to certain ter restrial animals as innumerable scifi aliens modeled on insects lizards or cats demon strate To put it somewhat differently aliens often present themselves as an amalgam of what one might refer to as emergent and re sidual dimensions of organic and cultural development in Raymond Williamss termi nology 4042 They embody on one hand humankinds possible technological futures and on the other hand forms of biology that in Western philosophy have often been associ ated with a past that needs to be superseded in order for authentic humanness to emerge5 By shifting its focus from the alien to the android or cyborg recent science fiction emphatically places questions of technology at the core of the human self6 More than that it embeds technology in the history of the species by making it the tool of human biological evolu tion This turn is perhaps most obvious in the work of the cyberpunk novelist Bruce Sterling who not only argued in his preface to the pathbreaking anthology Mirrorshades 1986 that for the cyberpunks    technology is visceral It is pervasive utterly intimate Not outside us but next to us Under our skin often inside our minds xiii but also made biotechnology the prime engine of hu man evolution in his novel Schismatrix 1985 Relying on a vision of history derived from Ilya Prigogines brand of chaos theory which emphasizes complexification mechanisms Sterling depicts a future humanity that with the help of bioengineering and terraforming explodes into multiple posthuman daugh ter clades in Sterlings own words 109 170 with very different organic shapes and social structures aliens with human roots But the trope of the android or cyborg while it effectively reframed questions about advanced technologies did not address issues of biological otherness that the figure of the alien had also raisedissues that because of the rise of the environmentalist movement in the 1960s and 1970s the emergence of ani mal rights advocacy in the 1970s and 1980s Peter Singers Animal Liberation appeared in 1975 Tom Regans Case for Animal Rights in 1983 and mounting concern about de creasing biodiversity from the 1980s onward moved ever closer to the center of public de bate Advances in gene research and biotech nology during the 1990s most famously the realization of the old science fiction motif of cloning with the creation of the sheep Dolly in 1996 reinforced concerns about the role of the biological other in visions of human tech nological progress If the mechanical artifi cially evolved or cyborgized animals in recent science fiction allude to such concerns they nevertheless fulfill a narrative function differ ent from that of biologically exotic aliens in earlier novels One of the more conventional scifi plot patternsundoubtedly influenced in no small measure by cold war geopolitical configurationsinvolves the unification of humankind across national racial and cul tural boundaries in the face of alien contact or invasion The arrival of the biological other in such scenarios forces humans to acknowledge their shared planetary habitat and species be longing Aliens authenticate humanness by virtue of their biological difference much as animals did before Darwinian theory blurred the boundaries between beast and man Ani mals in recent science fiction offer no such sure touchstone of difference products of hu man technology they sometimes carry human genes or have become humans intelligent equals The assertion of human authenticity in such contexts becomes difficult or indirect and is often fraught with conceptual tensions Some works propose a genuinely posthuman ist perspective in which human conscious ness is portrayed as one mode of being among others but most reaffirm a humanist perspec tive that only fits ironically or uneasily into sociobiological contexts that constantly de stabilize it In other words while all the works T ft  5  sd a ft SI This content downloaded from 1552304416 on Wed 29 Jan 2025 083819 UTC All use subject to

of technological and biological consciousness not all are posthumanist in the sense that they ultimately distance themselves from an affirmation of human uniqueness7 Dicks science fiction classic Do An droids Dream of Electric Sheep juxtaposes replicants who can only be told apart from normal humans by means of sophisticated psychological tests with electric animals lifelike but mechanical copies that can easily be identified by small switchplates hidden on their bodies After Haraways Cyborg Mani festo Dick was sometimes interpreted as suggesting a posthumanist acceptance of hu mans and replicants as equals since his pro tagonist affirms the inherent value of electric animals toward the end of the novel But as I have argued in more detail elsewhere 7174 Dick does not in fact postulate any simple parallelism between technologically produced humans and animals Instead he makes em pathy and care for real or artificial animals a crucial criterion for distinguishing hu

destruction of animals is an integral part of normal human behavior outside the novel may or may not be part of Dicks implicit social critique but in the novel authentic humannessa concept that the novel puts less in question than does Blade Runner the film loosely based on itis associated with biophilia8 Cyberpunk novelists indebted to Dicks work in many ways tend to reflect on the role of animals less than Dick does But mo ments such as that of a disinterested robot bighorn pretending to munch lichen beside the illuminated waterfall in the fake biotope atop a Manhattan hotel in William

female partner who has long since abandoned him leaving him in a manner reminiscent of Hemingway s Jake Barnessomething short of a real man The animal characters while hardly vibrant with vitality are less prone to such forms of de cline and better adapted to their new social positions After avenging Dulcies death on her murderer Joey Castle Metcalf withdraws from this society by voluntarily seeking out another term in the deep freeze that replaces jail time in Lethems future mostly because he is tired of technologies that reduce humans to amnesiac hulls and deliver instead of genuine life improvements appliances that greet their users with pointless flourishes of music Au thentic humanness this ending implies can only sustain itself in the absolute rejection of a society in which animals have become more existentially complex than average humans Evolved animals also play a crucial role in other novels such as Sheri S Tepper s envi ronmentally oriented The Family Tree 1997 in which the remote descendants of twentieth century biotech lab animalswho by a skillful narratological sleight of hand are identifiable as nonhuman only when seen through human eyes well into the noveldominate a dimin ished population of humans who are kept as work animals This idea takes a different turn in Margaret Atwoods Oryx and Crake 2003 a vigorous indictment of contemporary tech nologies that targets everything from televi sion the Internet and computer games to genetic engineering Jimmy the Snowman last survivor of the old humanity finds him self in the role of instructor to

representationthey have made an effigy of Jimmy during his ab sencesignals the emergence of just the kind of culture that Crake aimed to preclude in his genetic programming Yet it remains that the

struggle for his own and the Crakers survival Human cells and or gans in this scenario are no longer contained in the two human species but also form part of nonhuman organisms even as conversely nonhuman genes form part of the new hu mans Atwoods affirmation that authentic humanness can be identified through culture therefore plays itself out in a context that is thoroughly posthuman in biological terms As these examples show science fiction texts of the last four decades in which aliens have by and large been replaced by a combi nation of technologically modified humans and animals tend to articulate humanist per spectives that sit uneasily with the hybrid and clearly posthuman social and biological envi ronments they portray Such ambiguities also surface in other media The television science fiction series Dark Angel for example focuses on transgenic subjects with superhuman abilities who have escaped from a govern ment lab where they were trained as human weapons But in its second season as the lab is burned down and all its inmates freed by some of the androids the series shifts more and more toward other experimental humans made with genes from dogs lizards and fish9 While animals as such do not appear the overall sense Dark Angel conveys is once again that the figure of the android or cy borg needs to be supplemented by that of the animal even though the series shortcircuits what insights might result from this tantaliz ing conjunction through a simplistic finale that assimilates all the varied android forms into an allegory of multiculturalism Grant Morrison and Frank Quitelys graphic novel We3 2005 relies on a similar plot three household petsa dog a cat and a rabbit are transformed into cyborg superweapons with incipient humanlanguage abilities but are allowed to escape by the senior scientist when the government shuts the experiment down and orders the animals exterminated The rabbit is killed in ensuing with security forces but the rescued

persuasive recent exploration of the androidanimal relation is undoubtedly Ghost in the Shell 2 Innocence Visually even more stunning than Morrison and Quitely s graphic novel Oshiis anime re flects on the problematic of the android and cyborg with unsurpassed scope and philo sophical depth The plot revolves around a special police unit consisting of normal hu mans and armored cyborgs humans so heav ily enhanced by technology that their bodies may no longer be able to function without it This unit is called on to investigate the mys terious murders of several individuals by gy noids femaleappearing robots who should not normally be capable of such deeds But this plot merely forms the backdrop for a wideranging reflection on the human self in the age of technology that alludes to texts and writers from the Bible Dante Descartes and Milton to Auguste Villiers de llsleAdam Raymond Roussel and the Golem legend Thematically the reflection ranges from dolls robots cyborgs and digital forms of consciousness all the way to children whom a cyborg coroner aptly named Haraway de clares to be the result of the human desire to selfreplicate in the same way as dolls and robots Animals also feature prominently in this meditation Most obviously the unspo ken affection of the protagonist the armored cyborg Batou for his former colleague Major Motoko Kusanagi whose body was destroyed at the end of the first Ghost in the Shell movie and whose mind ranges freely in the cyber matrix is now complemented by the love he shows for his pet basset hound At one turn This content

his enemies man age to hack into his electronic brain in the store where they know he regularly goes to buy fresh food for his dog The bond between the mostly mechanical human and his pet is highlighted in a touch ing scene at Batous home during which we are shown a glimpse of the dog next to a wooden sculpture of the same species Shortly afterward the basset plays with a transpar ent toy sphere displaying a fish a motif that is echoed later in a scene in which what looks at first like a globe of Earth starts displaying the face of an ape and then of Batous dog as if to indicate how the world of humans who evolved from apelike ancestors is dominated by the animal even as humans have turned cyborg The last image of the film after a scene in which Batous partner Togusa has returned home to his daughter and given her a doll for a present shows Batou holding his dog in the same posture in which Togusa held his daughter The image of cyborg and dog outlined against the nocturnal silhouette of a thoroughly urban and industrial landscape both echoes and inverts Dicks reflection on replicants and animals As in Dick the technologically enhanced humans ability to bond with the animal serves as a touchstone of humanity But unlike Dicks androids the cyborg here succeeds in establishing that bond and the juxtaposition with the human family suggests that the film encourages the viewer to consider the ties of genealogy and those of biophilia as equivalent Along with Sterlings Schismatrix and Teppers Family Tree therefore Oshiis film comes closest among the works here discussed to suggest ing a posthumanist perspective in which hu man consciousness is not a priori set apart as unique But Innocence goes beyond many other contemporary works in that it not only juxtaposes androids and animals but also considers human consciousness as part of a broad range of different forms of connection among bodies consciousnesses and repre sentationsa range that includes dolls and robots on one end children and animals on the other and in the middle a variety of bio technological hybrids and symbioses 510  PMLA  o 0 E e c IS  si o
