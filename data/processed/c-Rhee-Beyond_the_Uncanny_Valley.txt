ABSTRACT This essay examines Japanese roboticist Masahiro Moris influential theory of the uncanny valley which holds that humans are attracted to robots that bear some resemblance to humans and are re pelled by robots that resemble humans too much experiencing these alltoohuman robots as eerie and uncanny It argues that in ignoring time and lived experience the uncanny valley inscribes exclusionary boundaries around the human that are presented as inherent The es say places Moris theory into conversation with Philip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and what it identifies as the novels ontology of entanglement between human and nonhuman From this conversation it suggests that rather than wielding Moris uncanny valley to uncritically replicate and reify our biases about the human the uncanny valley can be viewed as a site that renders visible these boundaries and normative conceptions so that we might expand our visions of the human beyond them while examining the histories by which these boundaries emerge My own concern is    that the discourses and imaginaries that inspire robotic visions will retrench rather than challenge and hold open for contest received conceptions of humanness Lucy Suchman HumanMachine Reconfigurations Beyond the Uncanny Valley Masahiro Mori and Philip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Configurations 2013 21301329  2014 by Johns

delineated and differentially constituted Karen Barad Meeting the Universe Halfway Introduction In 1970 Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori was invited to par ticipate in a roundtable titled Robotics and Thought and to con tribute to a corresponding issue of the journal Energy1 The resulting essay Bukimi No Tani was featured in Jasia Reichardts Robots Fact Fiction and Prediction 1978 under the heading Human reactions to imitation humans or Masahiro Moris Uncanny Valley In 2005 Moris uncanny valley theory received attention at the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers IEEE Robotics and Automa tion Society International Conference on Humanoid Robots2 Also in 2005 roboticists Karl MacDorman and Takashi Minato released an English translation of the essay titled The Uncanny Valley which was circulated both within and beyond the robotics commu nity Since 2005 Moris uncanny valley theory has had significant influence in US humanoid robotics and recently the theory has also gained traction in discussions of human realism in computer graphics and film and video game animation In 2012 a new English translation of Moris essay was published in IEEE Robotics  Automa tion Magazine This version translated by MacDorman and technol ogy writer Norri Kageki is the first translation authorized by Mori3 This essay begins with a critique of the uncanny valley in par ticular of the theorys reification of the human as inherent and originary Bringing Moris theory into conversation with feminist science studies and queer theory I offer an alternative reading of the uncanny valley as a site of entanglementone that highlights and challenges constructed boundaries between human and nonhuman as well as opens up these boundaryconstructions for critical engage ment and historicization In engaging the uncanny in this way this essay also turns to Philip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep 1 Other roundtable participants included philosophy professor Natsuhiko

features the uncanny as a force that destabilizes nor mative and exclusionary boundaries around the human Through these uncanny destabilizations Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep challenges both the fixity of the human and constructed borders protecting abiding definitions of the human The Uncanny Valley According to Moris uncanny valley theory humans are drawn to robots with some degree of human resemblance however hu mans are repelled by robots that resemble humans too closely The point at which the degree of human resemblance tips humans posi tive affinity into eerieness or uncanniness marks one boundary of the uncanny valley fig 1 As the graph in figure 1 illustrates Mori maps industrial robots on the low end of human likeness and thus of positive affinity A toy robot designed with more human traits a face a humanoid body evokes more affinity shinwakan And the traditional Japanese Bunraku puppet which bears an even higher de gree of human likeness and is encountered within the acculturated historical context of performance and audience expectations evokes an even greater degree of positive affinity Mori locates the virtually lifelike prosthetic hand in the space of negative affinity called the uncanny valley According to him were one to discover that such a hand is not a living human hand but a very lifelike prosthetic one would no longer feel an affinity to ward this hand in fact one would encounter this hand as eerie and uncanny For example while gripping what turns out to be some ones lifelike prosthetic in a handshake one might have expected the warmth and firmness of a human hand thus one would be tak en aback by the hands limp boneless grip together with its texture and coldness4 The dissonance between ones expectations and the prosthetics machine tactility would prompt one to experience the prosthetic hand as eerie In this way the virtually lifelike prosthetic hand lies in the uncanny valley where human likeness increases and affinity decreases see fig 1 Movement heightens the possible degrees of both positive affinity and eeriness that one might experi ence thus the lifelike prosthetic hand in motion the myoelectric hand in figure 2 elicits a greater sense of eeriness than it would at rest A closer look at the highest points on both graphs demonstrates Moris reliance upon what he calls a healthy person In figure 2 he 4 Masahiro

both human like ness and positive affinity This healthy person which Mori evokes without definition or specification marks both the farthest point of human likeness on the xaxis and the highest point of positive affinity on the yaxis thus this healthy person is the standard of humanness against which both humanoids and humans are mea sured This healthy person in addition to evoking more positive af finity in humans than Moris ill person is also the imagined human who appropriately registers positive or negative affinity in relation to humanoid figures5 For Mori the centrality of this healthy per son emerges from our instincts for selfpreservation and avoidance of death6 Therefore in figure 2 the motionless corpse falls at the bottom of the uncanny valley accounting for stillness the zombie the animated livingdead falls at the bottom of the deeper valley accounting for movement Moris twofold goal consists of understanding the human by map ping the uncanny valley and following from this map designing humanoid machines with which humans will want to interact We should begin to build an accurate map of the uncanny valley so that 5 As this myoelectric hand makes movements it could make healthy people feel un easy ibid p 99 emphasis added 6 Ibid p 100 Figure 1 Masahiro Moris uncanny valley graph Source Masahiro Mori The Uncanny Valley trans Karl F MacDorman and Norri Kageki IEEE

people can relate comfortably7 Keeping in mind the goal of designing robots that will not repel humans or cause them to feel uncomfortable Mori cautions that roboticists not design robots with too high a degree of human likeness instead he recommends that they aim for the first peak moderate human like ness and high affinity and avoid the second peak greater human likeness and higher affinity lest robots aimed toward this second peak fall into the uncanny valley8 The Uncanny Valley Labor and History Neither Moris uncanny valley theory nor his recommendations to roboticists differentiates between initial encounters with human oid figures and prolonged interactions with them For example if one were to have an initial uncanny response when shaking the aforementioned lifelike prosthetic hand over time and repeated handshakes one might no longer find anything remarkable much less uncanny about the prosthetic hand Indeed the hands bone 7 Ibid 8 Mori continues to stand by this recommendation see Kageki Uncanny Mind above n 1 p 106 Figure 2 Masahiro Moris uncanny valley graph with movement Source Masahiro Mori The Uncanny Valley trans Karl F MacDorman and Norri Kageki IEEE

go unnoticed Therefore with time and repetition the prosthetic hand might move from within the uncanny valley to outside its borders9 In ignoring time and the sub sequent possibility of reorienting our affinitive responses to human oid technologies we ignore the discursive embodied and affective labors that bring these responses positive or negative into being10 In so doing we risk uncritically and erroneously privileging certain definitions of humanness as fixed and inherent holding up con ceptions of the human that hierarchize and exclude on the basis of this presumption In HumanMachine Reconfigurations Plans and Situated Actions Lucy Suchman addresses the roles of time repetition and labor in pro ducing fluid interactions with humanoid robots She writes specifi cally of her own stilted encounters with Kismet Cynthia Breazeals groundbreaking sociable robot that uses emotional facial expressions and nonverbal vocalizations to communicate with humans fig 311 During her visit to Breazeals lab Suchman recounts none of our party was successful in eliciting coherent or intelligible behaviors from Kismet12 She goes on to compare her partys unsuccessful interactions to the fluidity of Breazeals interactions with the robot The contrast between my own encounter with Kismet and that re corded on the demonstration videos with Breazeal makes clear the ways in which Kismets affect is an effect not simply of the device itself but of Breazeals trained reading of Kismets actions and her extended history of labors with the machine13 Sara Ahmed in her Queer Phenomenology Orientations Objects Others offers a useful discussion of such labor as an autoobscuring process According to Ahmed labor as history often renders itself invisible through its repetition 9 We might also understand Moris wariness of movement in robotic design through movements existence in time because to introduce movement is to introduce time 10 This lack of distinction between initial uncanniness and habituation over time is particularly relevant as Mori is participating in a larger conversation about designing robotic technologies for regular human use 11 Breazeal modeled Kismets interactivities on adultinfant interactions thus encour aging humans to take the lead in these interactions while similarly keeping expecta tions for Kismets performance low See Cynthia L Breazeal

gives bodies their tendencies    the labor of such repetition disap pears through labor if we work hard at something then it seems effortless This paradoxwith effort it becomes effortlessis precisely what makes his tory disappear in the moment of its enactment The repetition of the work is what makes the work disappear It is important that we think not only about what is repeated but also about how the repetition of actions takes us in certain directions we are also orientating ourselves toward some objects more than others in cluding not only physical objects    but also objects of thought feeling and judgment as well as objects in the sense of aims aspirations and objectives14 14 Sara Ahmed Queer Phenomenology Orientations Objects Others Durham NC Duke University Press 2006 p 56 emphasis added Figure 3 Cynthia Breazeals robot Kismet Photo Sam Odgen courtesy of the MIT Museum 308 Configurations Repetitionthe history of laborthat crucially orients us toward certain objects and relations and away from others obscures itself and its orientating work Indeed labors invisibility the performance of effortlessness is often its aim In the case of Kismet and Breazeal their effortless interactions emerge only by virtue of Breazeals ex tended history of labors with the machine And yet this seemingly effortless fluidity between Breazeal and Kismet obscures the very his tory of labors that brings this fluidity into being Tendencies that seem originary that appear as a priori or inher ent Ahmed argues in fact emerge from the histories of labors that orient us toward certain objects and relations and away from others What bodies tend to do are effects of histories rather than being originary15 It is on this theoretical groundingthis attention to labor history and the nonoriginariness of tendenciesthat I read the uncanny valley and its vision of humanness Moris theory takes as its starting point a specific tendency toward the human that hu mans respond in specific ways to different degrees of human like ness However as Ahmed asserts there is nothing inherent about this tendency rather these responses are produced through the his tory of repeated labors inscriptions and orientations Additionally the uncanny valley theory privileges Moris idea of a healthy person qua human holding it up both as the model for what a human should be and in his recommendation to avoid the uncanny valley in robotic design as that which should be safeguarded Thus the un canny valley theory and its various robotic applications inscribe as inherent nonoriginary tendencies toward the human overlooking not only the constitutive histories and temporalities that produce these tendencies and ideals but also their effects and consequences in the present and future In a recent interview Mori describes the uncanny valley as my intuition And later in the interview he continues pointing out the existence of the uncanny valley was more of a piece of ad vice from me to people who design robots rather than a scientific statement16 Considering both Moris description of the uncanny 15 Ibid 16 Kageki Uncanny Mind above n 1 pp 112 106 Prior to this interview several roboticists have critiqued Moris theorization of the uncanny valley on the grounds that it is largely speculation and not based on empirical or theoretical evidence Regarding the adherence to the uncanny valley despite the speculative nature of its claims David Hanson argues that Mori put forth the uncanny valley as speculation not as a true scientific theory But he drew it as a graph and that made it seem more scientific Its not a scientific hypothesis that was tested with data though qtd in Tom Geller Overcoming the Uncanny Valley IEEE Computer Graphics and Applica Rhee  Beyond the Uncanny Valley valley theory as intuition and the theorys widespread application I suggest that we engage his uncanny valley its healthy person qua human and his observations about industrial robots toys and pros thetics as normativizing claims17 As Karen Barad suggests in the epi graph such claims about the human should not be taken for granted as universal inherent or originary nor should they go uninterro gated The uncanny valley the imagined human it holds up as its exemplar and the boundaries between human and nonhuman that it presumes are in fact deeply embedded within constitutive his tories of cultural technoscientific political discursive and embod ied practices Therefore the uncanny valley theory functions less as boundaryidentifying rule than as boundarymaking practice18 Suchman describes normative and essentializing impulses in hu manoid technologies as abstractions in which the human is typi cally stripped of its contingency locatedness historicity and specific embodiments19 To elaborate on the stakes of this discussion of the tions 284 2008 1117 quote on p 12 And Frances Gee and colleagues while not critical of Moris theory point to a gap between the

most elastic fictions20 And yet this fiction wields incredible force in the world how the human is defined has very real effects particularly for those who are excluded from the community of humans and the rights protections and privileges accorded therein Writing in 1996 Fuss elaborates That the human has a history comes as no surprise to those subjects so rou tinely and so violently excluded

deployed as a weapon of potent ideological force its unstable boundaries perpetually challenged and redrawn to exclude entire groups of socially disempowered subjects the homeless mothers on welfare blacks in prison people with HIVAIDS illegal aliens The human is not and has never been an all inclusive category21 The human as Fuss underscores is a term with shifting definitions and imaginaries And these definitions and imaginaries possess tre mendous ideological force that operates largely through their ability to go uninterrogated to pass as inherent and fixed Taking into ac count both Moris influence in humanoid robotics and robotics tech nologies increasing presence in our lives and worlds it is incumbent to ask How is the human defined in these robotic visions and tech nological

Bringing the uncanny valley into conversation with Ahmeds nonoriginary tendencies and Fusss history of the human opens up Moris essay in two ways first this reading does not uncritically ac cept and privilege his normative conceptions of the human and the healthy person22 And second engaging the uncanny valley thus 20 Diana Fuss ed Introduction in Human All Too Human New York Routledge 1996 pp 17 quote on p 1 21 Ibid pp 12 22 Dicks work is doubly relevant here not only because of the centrality of the un canny and humanoids in his fictions but also because of the portrayals of disability in these same works For example see Michael Bérubés discussion of intellectual disabil ity in Dicks Martian TimeSlip Bérubé Narrative and Intellectual Disability in A Companion to American Literary Studies ed Caroline F Levander and Robert S Levine New York WileyBlackwell 2011 pp 469482 esp pp 474478 Rhee  Beyond the Uncanny Valley offers a way to rethink Moris essay as productively challenging the very human abstractions that form the basis and center of his uncanny valley theory In other words Moris uncanny valley can be reoriented away from boundarymaking and boundarypolicing practices and toward locating and highlighting where abstracting and normativizing borders around the human have been drawn hence making these boundaries and their histories of labor visible for critical engagement23 In this reading the uncanny valley theory in revealing and destabilizing the boundaries placed around the hu man allows us to in Suchmans words challenge and hold open for contest received conceptions of humanness24 A Few Remarks on Translation My discussion of Moris uncanny valley as a site of destabilization emerges from the 2012 English translation of the essay Considering the wide circulation and influence of the 2005 English translation it is important to note a significant difference between these two trans lations In MacDorman and Minatos 2005 translation as in Reich ardts 1978 discussion shinwakan is translated as familiarity25 but in the 2012 translation it is translated as affinity Notably neither familiarity nor familiar appears anywhere in the 2012 transla tion This shift in translation is significant because the quality of fa miliarity unlike that of affinity relies without exception upon prior knowledge and habitual experience26 In earlier translations then 23 Within this approach it is of particular importance to engage the nonneutrality of these boundaries in relation to their funding structures including major robotics funder DARPA Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and its militarized priorities 24 Suchman HumanMachine Reconfigurations above n 12 p 239 25 In 2007 Christoph Bartneck and colleagues questioned earlier English translations of shinwakan as familiarity suggesting that these deviate somewhat from the original Japanese We also questioned whether Moris shinwakan sic concept might have been lost in translation and in consultation with several Japanese linguists we dis covered that shinwakan is not a commonly used word nor does it have a direct equiv alent in English In fact familiarity appeared to be the least suitable translation com pared to affinity and in particular to likeability Bartneck et al Is the Uncanny Valley an Uncanny Cliff p 369 26 The Oxford English Dictionary offers the

The Uncanny in which he describes the uncanny as that class of the terrifying which leads back to something long known to us once very familiar Freud The Uncanny in Collected 312 Configurations avoiding the uncanny valley meant staying within the realm of the familiar within the realm of the everyday and the already known On the other hand affinity is a relation of attraction that is not nec essarily bound to previous experience Liking for or attraction to a person or thing natural inclination towards something sympathy and understanding for something an instance of this27 The 2012 translations use of affinity shifts the emphasis of Moris essay away from familiarity and toward possible positive affinities with the un familiar If the axis of familiarity pushed the uncanny valley toward existing relations and definitions of the human the axis of affinity pushes it toward forging new humanmachine relations and poten tially imagining new definitions and expectations of the human

Valley the author as fearlessly and ingeniously playing with issues of the uncanny in his stories about androids and AI31 Like Barad Dick in his engagements with the uncanny refuses to take the distinction between human and nonhuman for granted Indeed this refusal is at the center of much of his work Rather than offering worlds in which clean distinctions can be made between human and non human Dicks fictions explore unavoidable entanglements between human and nonhuman and among self other and world The question of the human is a central preoccupation for Dick whose explorations of it often take shape through what we have been discussing as the uncannyan unsettling confusion about the boundary between human and nonhuman32 Often staging extended uncanny confusions that invariably dissolve the boundaries between human and nonhuman other Dicks work points to the important boundarydestabilizing work that the uncanny can perform In so doing his engagement with the uncanny points to the human as in sympathy with Fuss Ahmed Suchman and Barad a deeply fluid and shifting construction that emerges through acts of boundary creation and boundarypolicing33 Artificial humans heavily

devolution of humans in Dicks oeuvre in his earlier work artificial humans are merely automatons in subsequent works they become progres sively more human with their own identity will and agency Mean while as Dicks artificial humans become more human his humans become increasingly machinelike and schizophrenic withdrawing from the world In the final stage of human devolution these schiz oid humans with their mechanical personalities resemble Dicks preevolved and nonagential early androids34 Kim Stanley Robinson in discussing Dicks reversals of existing sciencefiction conventions also writes of Dicks robots as ontologically bound to questions of the human Instead of the robot is just like us the approach often taken in earlier robotthemed science fiction Dicks robotsseldom robots as such but rather androids or simulacra emphasizing their human exteriorsconvey the message we are just like the robot35 Imposter a short story that takes place within an extended ex perience of uncanny confusion brings this inextricability of human and humanoid to the fore The story centers around the question of whether Spence Olham is human or a robot imposter an animate bomb36 sent to Earth to kill Olham take his place and detonate Olham believes he is human however he learns that certainty guar antees nothing as a robot imposter would be similarly certain of its humanness Therefore for humans and robots alike uncertainty pervades in a way that imagines both the limits of René Descartess cogito I think I am human but am I really and its heft If robot Olham thinks he is really Olham who is to say that robotOlham is entirely incorrect This disconcerting uncanny confusion centrally drives the story human and robot are deeply entangled with both human and robot imposter coexisting as viable and virtually indistin guishable possibilities Is Olham a human or a robot imposter This question is resolved in the last sentence of the story However I will leave us suspended in this

cialsindividuals mentally and genetically affected by the radia tion Corporatized technology from moodregulating devices to an droids is inescapable in its hegemony And despite the scarcity of living animals the vastly popular religion of Mercerism mandates that humans demonstrate empathy toward animals hence the me chanical animal industry is flourishing including animal hospitals that repair

Dicks part    There is a symmetrical contradiction in the novels portrayal of the human characters Hu mans are in turn sympathetic and vicious43 Moving from an opening opposition between human and android to human empathy for androids to a concluding refusal to dehuman ize the android other the novel presents a series of uncanny moments that repeatedly upends notions of autonomy offering instead an on tology of intraaction and entanglement as described by Barad The neologism intraaction signifies the mutual constitution of entangled agen cies That is in contrast to the usual interaction which assumes that there are separate individual agencies that precede their interaction the notion of intraaction recognizes that distinct agencies do not precede but rather emerge through their intraaction It is important to note that the distinct agencies are only distinct in a relational not an absolute sense that is agen cies are only distinct in relation to their mutual

Valley Attending to the intraaction between humans and androids this sec tion traces the uncanny throughout the novel examining the un cannys simultaneous introduction and destabilization of boundaries as well as the mutual entanglements highlighted by the uncanny The novels first uncanny confusion introduces multiple tests for identifying androids only to undermine these tests in the same scene Rick Deckard successfully identifies Rachael Rosen as a Nexus6 android using the official VoigtKampff test which measures an individuals verbal and physiological responses to questions about animal cruelty Rachael and her uncle momentarily convince Rick that the test results are a fluke drawing on the very real possibility indeed the likelihoodthat the test would incorrectly identify schizoid and schizophrenic humans as androids45 Rick is persuaded believing Rachaels test results to be similarly flawedthat is un til he remembers his conversations with Rachael outside of the test questions Shifting from official to unofficial testing Rick recalls that during these conversations Rachael refers to her owl as an it It he thought She keeps calling the owl it Not her46 Rachaels pronoun slip is verboten in a society that views empathy toward animals as a primary index of humanness47 And it is this slip that correctly per suades Rick that she is an android Yet just as this scene challenges the authority of the official VoigtKampff test it also deauthorizes Ricks informal language test for if Rachaels pronoun slip identifies her as an android if this particular pronoun usage is the determining and damning criterion distinguishing human from android then Rick would also fail this test because he also refers to the owl as it48 45 This likelihood is raised earlier in the novel by Ricks boss Dick Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep above n 35 pp 3739 46 Ibid p 58 emphasis in original 47 That Rachael is revealed as an android because she disregards the gender of the owl interestingly inflects Alan Turings imitation game what we now know as the Turing test Turings imitation game begins with a man and a woman competing to be iden tified as a woman by a third human Turing then asks us to consider this game if the woman were replaced by a machine Prevailing understandings of the Turing test dis pense entirely with the question of gender around which Turing centrally organized his imitation game By returning gender both to the project of distinguishing between human and machine and to the project of being human this scene can be read as a striking critique of the various ways in which gender has largely been written out of the Turing test In Dicks novel it is precisely the act of doing away with gender that iden tifies one as nothuman 48 If you sold your owl he said to the girl Rachael Rosen how much would you want for it and how much of that down Dick Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep above n 35 p 42 In a further disorienting twist the scene concludes with the rev elation that Rachaels owl is in fact mechanical thus Rachael al though an android may not have revealed her own artificiality by referring to the owl as it but rather revealed the artificiality of the owl49 Ricks determining realization She keeps calling the owl it Not her while leading him to correctly identify Rachael as an android was premised on a flawed premise that the owl was a living animal This opening uncanny scene with its simultaneous introduction and deauthorization of multiple tests and their dizzyingly unstable criteria establishes that no boundary test or criterion to distinguish androids from humans is reliable much less infallible The following uncanny encounters set up machine intelligence and machine life as inescapably gendered In her masterful reading of Dick Katherine Hayles offers the schizoid android as a way to think about the triangulation of male subjects androids and schiz oid female subjects in Dicks works Gender dynamics is central to these complexities for when the schizoid woman is brought into close proximity with a male character he reacts to the android ism in her personality by experiencing a radical instability in the boundaries that define him and his world50 In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep genders boundarydestabilization is largely played out through language For example Ricks hunt for male Nexus6 android Max Polokov is relatively brief and unremarkable Polokov masquerading as Soviet bountyhunter Sandor Kadalyi introduces himself to Rick Moments later Rick without the aid of the Voigt Kampff test realizes that Kadalyi is in fact the android Polokov In this moment of realization Rick proclaims Youre not Polokov youre Kadalyi51 reversing the names of the human and android Despite this verbal slip Rick is neither uncertain about Polokovs android status nor conflicted about killing him nor is Polokov de picted in this brief scene as anything but a threat a dangerous brute Rather Ricks slip points to the paradox between the privileged role of language as an authoritative test to root out androids and the fal libility of language as a mode of communication 49 Ibid p 60 Indeed earlier in this scene Rachael refers to Bill the raccoon as he further highlighting the possibility that her use of it when referencing the owl emerged from the distinction between living and mechanical animals rather than from between living and mechanical humans p 41 50 Hayles How We Became Postmodern above n 30 p 162 51 Dick Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep above n 35 p 92 318 Configurations If Ricks encounter with Polokov is marked by its moral clarity and narrative simplicity Ricks encounter with his next android target female Luba Luft resonates with deep moral confusion and linguistic and narrative complexity At the beginning of his hunt Rick easily tracks down Luba who is hiding in plain sight as an ac complished opera singer On the stage Luba Luft sang and Rick found himself surprised at the quality of her voice it rated with that of the best even that of notables in his collec tion of historic tapes The Rosen Association built her well he had to admit And again he perceived himself sub specie aeternitatis the formdestroyer called forth by what he heard and saw here Perhaps the better she functions the better a singer she is the more I am needed    I wonder when I should do it he asked himself As soon as possible probably At the end of the rehearsal when she goes to her dressing room52 An opera lover Rick takes a moment to appreciate her voice then resolutely sets about the business of first administering the Voigt Kampff test then retiring Luba53 At this moment he is unconflicted about his task as he begins to speak with Luba however things become incredibly murky In her excellent essay Entering the Posthuman Collective in Phil ip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Jill Galvan offers a useful reading of Lubas VoigtKampff test54 According to Galvans discussion in the novel state power operates through language and technology permeating every aspect of daily life on earth Androids and humans alike even humans like Rick who ostensibly represent the law are subject to control and manipulation by the state Draw ing on Jean Baudrillard Galvan observes that in the test language is mobilized to assure the androids condemnation55 in large part by creating a nonreciprocal language encounter Deputized to ad minister the test Rick insists repeatedly upon Lubas response but 52 Ibid p 99 53 The novel oscillates between the language of killing androids and retiring an droids The former humanizes androids and dehumanizes android bountyhunters while the latter dehumanizes androids and deflects the inhumanity of those who de stroy them 54 Galvan describes the trajectory of the novel as against the designs and control techniques of the state Rick coming to terms with a posthuman community one in which humans and androids coexist and cooriginate See Jill Galvan Entering the Posthuman Collective in Philip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Science Fiction Studies 243 1997 413429 esp p 426 55 Ibid p 421 Rhee  Beyond the Uncanny Valley in Baudrillards view of course that response would only confirm the operation of the hegemonic code To respond means to submit to the codes inherent lack of reciprocity and thus to forfeit all chance of dodging the totalitarian order56 Nonreciprocity is built into the test such that any direct response to a question would trap and con demn the android Luba however momentarily subverts this trap of nonreciprocity by refusing to directly answer Ricks VoigtKampff questions For example in response to the question Youre sitting watching TV and suddenly you discover a wasp crawling on your wrist Luba responds with Whats a wasp    Do they still exist Ive never seen one    Tell me the German word    And what was the question I forget already57 As Galvan points out because of Lu bas evasive language maneuvers Rick is unable to get a VoigtKampff reading therefore she momentarily escapes being killed Expanding on Galvans reading of this scene I offer that Lubas language maneuvers extend beyond her test In fact prior to Rick ad ministering the test Luba employs language in a way that highlights the paradox introduced in the Polokov scene that language works against the androids both inside and outside the VoigtKampff test while languages authority is continuously destabilized by its dem onstrated fallibility Unlike Polokov Luba is able to exploit this lan guage paradox turning language against Rick and creating nonrecip rocal language traps that identify him as an android An android Rick said doesnt care what happens to another android Thats one of the indications we look for Then Miss Luft said you must be an android That stopped him he stared at her Because she continued your job is to kill them isnt it58 Luba takes possession of both languages nonreciprocity and the ex clusively human prerogative to identify androids In so doing she ar rests Rick destabilizing his previously secure and uncomplicated po sitions within language the state and humankind and ultimately turning his world upsidedown Lubas subversive languageexploits also carry with them a comparable force of the law which becomes evident when she calls a shadow police force to take Rick into cus tody This police force led by a Nexus6 android recognizes Rick not as a fellow officer they have no record of him but as a suspect 56 Ibid For Galvans discussion of Jean Baudrillard on language reciprocity and mass media see pp 420421 57 Dick Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep above n 35 pp 102103 58 Ibid p 101 320 Configurations Luba by exploiting languages paradoxical authority and fallibil ity turns Ricks previous authoritative relations to language and the law against him and it is after being so disoriented that Rick is re oriented beginning to newly empathize with Luba and becoming conflicted about killing her In his discussion of Dicks novel Fredric Jameson identifies the android cogito or I think therefore I am an android The android cogito Jameson describes is a peculiarly virulent and modern it eration of Cartesian skepticism that reverses the external issue of testing into a permanent rift within selfconsciousness itself59 Bringing the android cogito into conversation with the uncanny we might understand the rift that emerges in the android cogito as operating through humans troubling discovery of their similarities to androids and humans subsequent unnerving defamiliarization of themselves to themselves Thus the android cogito fundamentally destabilizes the subject because it requires simultaneous identifica tion and disidentification with humans and androids alike For Rick who is unwavering in the face of android accusations by Luba and officers in the shadow police station the android cogito is medi ated through fellow android bountyhunter Phil ReschPhil who is cruel and kills androids without psychic disturbance Phil who advises Rick to have sex with female androids before killing them Phil whom Rick despises and hopes will test as an android and im portantly Phil who is accused of being an android and unlike Rick is subsequently tormented by this accusation60 After a VoigtKampff test reveals Phil to be human Ricks world is again radically disrupted as he realizes that Phil is not an empathylacking android but that Rick himself is an inversely empathetic human who empathizes with Luba an android and not Phil a human61 While this uncanny in version this mediated android cogito confuses and depresses Rick it also shifts him further toward entanglement and intraaction 59 Fredric Jameson

Rhee  Beyond the Uncanny Valley Queer Telepathy In Computing Machinery and Intelligence which introduces what we now know as the Turing test Turing includes a brief dis cussion about how to modify the test should telepathic humans participate62 In his recent study of Dicks work Laurence Rickels discusses telepathy as queering the Turing test What exceeds Turings conclusion regarding the equivalence of human and artifi cial intelligence in the context of interpersonal telecommunication is the exception he leaves open the one that rules in Dicks future worlds What could always queer Turings

experiment64 disori enting and disordering established boundaries between human and machine intelligence Building on Rickelss discussion I propose that in the novel telepathy in the form of an unexplained and unspoken communication between Rick and John Isidore queers the authori tative function of spoken and nonreciprocal language as discussed by Galvan65 Warrick offers an important reading of John as Ricks lost second self their respective narratives paralleling and reversing each other throughout the novel While Rick metaphors law by hunting and killing androids Isidore metaphors love by caring for living and mechanical beings alike taking in and protecting the very androids that Rick is hunting Rick and John unite at the end of the novel when their twinned narratives intersect at last66 Deviating some 62 If telepathy is admitted it will be necessary to tighten our test up    To put the competitors into a telepathyproof room would satisfy all

prominence of the paranormal in Dicks works and his racing writing process this telepathic com munication is more likely the result of error than intention Nonetheless Rick and Johns multiple sites of unspoken yet shared knowledge about a living spider are strik ing and worth exploring 66 Patricia S Warrick Mind in Motion The Fiction of Philip K Dick Carbondale South ern Illinois University 1987 pp 117132 Dick himself describes the contrast between Johns love for androids and Ricks murderous relation with androids as in some ways    the primary story see Philip K Dick  what from Warricks reading I point to this narrative intersection as a moment not so much of unity but of entanglement as evidenced by the emergence of Rick and Johns telepathic communication about a living spider Near the end of the novel John looks down and miraculously spots a rare living spider on the ground On a step ahead of him something small moved in the dust67 Shortly thereafter Rick and John finally and briefly meet when Rick spots John releasing the spider into the weeds What did you do Rick holding the flashlight asked I put down a spider John said wondering why the man didnt see in the beam of yellow light the spider bloated up larger than life So it could get away Why dont you take it up to your apartment You ought to keep it in a jar According to the January Sidneys most spiders are up ten percent in retail price You could have gotten a hundred and some odd dollars for it Isidore said If I took it back up there shed cut it apart again Bit by bit to see what it did Androids do that68 This conversation comprises the entirety of John and Ricks spoken communication about the spider Following this conversation John refuses to lead Rick to the androids so Rick continues his hunt alone musing Ive never found a live wild animal It must be a fantastic experience to look down and see something living scuttling along Maybe itll happen someday to me like it did to John69 While Rick aptly describes how John came upon the spider in their brief encounter John did not mention how he acquired the spider much less that he had found the spider scuttling along on the ground And yet Rick knows marking a telepathic relation between the two men that bypasses spoken language which is too often the terrain on which authority is enacted and boundaries between human and nonhuman policed It is no small point that Rick and Johns telepathic communica tion revolves around a spider considering the centrality of animals as totems for empathy The spider is also connected to Mercerism which mandates

dejected and deeply confused about his newfound empathy for androids he confronts his newly acquired doubts about his work and his world Rick realizes that over the course of the day and the uncanny

the desta bilizing force of the uncanny such that Rick and Johns telepathic connection emerges as an entangled bond one that circumvents the authoritative force of spoken language The novel spans a single day and a succession of uncanny confu sions between human and android living and mechanical In Dick fashion the novels conclusion is decidedly ambivalent As numer ous critics have observed it offers no resolutions by which narrative nor moral integrity is restored74 The closest approximation to a reso lution is Ricks resignation that everything is true    Everything anybody has every thought75 The novels conclusion also offers no possibility of escape no escape from technocorporate hegemo ny and no escape from the inevitable effects of postwar radioactive fallout There is only acceptance of this inescapability and the pos sibility of reorienting oneself in relation to these forces76 And this minimal reorientation from autonomy to entangled intraaction is the small victory that Rick claims at the end of the novel In this entanglement lies a tiny sliver of hope for him and his otherwise bleak and limited future 74 For example as Hayles describes the novels conclusion no big problems are solved here Only a modest accommodation has been reached infused with multiple ironies that emphasizes survival and the mixed condition of humans who are at their best when they show

Writer of the Digital Age New York Routledge 2009 p 8 Rhee  Beyond the Uncanny Valley The novel highlights this reorientation by mirroring its opening and closing scenes Opening on a scene of domestic disharmony in Rick and Irans apartment the novel begins with the couple argu ing about technology Rick is frustrated by Irans dissatisfaction with the mood organ and Iran demonstrating empathy toward androids calls Rick a murderer hired by the cops77 Their argument escalates concluding only when Rick dials moodaltering states on their re spective mood organs pleased acknowledgment of husbands supe rior wisdom in all matters for her and a creative and fresh attitude toward his job for him78 The concluding scene of the novel also takes place in Rick and Irans apartment their earlier disharmony replaced by tenderness as together they examine the toad come to terms with its mechanical state and accept its value as a creatureas life As the novel closes Iran is about to dial Ricks mood organ to 670 long deserved peace when Rick falls into a deep sleep No need to turn on the mood organ Iran realized79 because Rick had achieved longdeserved peace without its mediation In the open ing scene of the novel Iran contained82 Iran who whenever programming such deep despair made sure to program an automatic resetting at 481 several hours later Was Ricks deep questioning of reality throughout the day all the product of his earlier dialing for a creative and fresh attitude toward his job Does Ricks attaining long deserved peace on his own indicate that he is less dependent on the Penfield mood organ or has he so thoroughly absorbed the cybernetic circuit such that the absence of the mood organ only highlights the total control of the moodorgan technology on him Whatever the answers the novel ends with Iran in part because the novel cannot end with Ricks long deserved peace as such op timism would belie the impossibility of escaping the bleak realities of this world To end on Ricks peace would also belie the contradic tions paradoxes and inconsistencies by which he is able to achieve itkey among these that Rick only attains his concluding peace on the backs of the androids he killed Galvan describes this paradox through abjection Rick cannot see himself as part of a posthuman community until he has abjected himself in aspects both figura tive and literaluntil he has horrified himself as a murderer and by this act acknowledged himself as a nonsubject83 It is then only through his acceptance of his own inhumanity that he finds a more ethical relation with the world The novel through its multiple uncanny confusions redefines the human not through dehumanizing and excluding the android other nor constructing and affirming the radical alterity of the an droid but instead through acknowledging the deep inhumanity of the human Earlier in the novel Rick who is normally reluctant to engage with the empathy box takes hold of its handles and fuses with Mercer During this fusion Mercer appears bearing advice You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go It is the basic condition of life to be required to violate your own identity At some time every creature which lives must do so It is the ultimate shadow the defeat of creation this is the curse at work the curse that feeds on all life Everywhere in the universe84 This decidedly ambivalent resolution offered by Mercer and ultimately by the novel privileges the acceptance of ones own inhumanity over the dehumanization of the other What matters at the end then is Ricks acceptance of his own inhumanity in that it marks his refusal to dehumanize 82 Ibid p 239 83 Galvan Entering the Posthuman Collective above n 54 p 426 84 Ibid p 179 Rhee  Beyond the Uncanny Valley 328 Configurations android others even while killing them his refusal to participate in a certain kind of boundarymaking Conclusion Boundarymaking and unmaking If Ricks trajectory moves from agential autonomy to entangled intraaction the novel as a whole asks us to engage a larger ques tion posed by Suchman about how to configure humanmachine assemblages such that we can intraact responsibly and generatively with and through them85 For her responding to this question re quires an understanding of boundaries as constructed and never innocent Drawing on Barad Suchman writes that Barads agential realism reminds us that boundaries between humans and ma chines are not naturally given but constructed in particular historical ways and with particular social and material consequences As Barad points out boundaries are necessary for the creation of meaning and for that very reason are never innocent Because the cuts implied in boundary making are always agentially positioned rather than naturally occurring and because boundaries have real conse quences accountability is mandatory86 The accountability involved is not however a matter of identifying authorship in any simple sense but rather a problem of understanding the effects of particular assemblages and assessing the distributions for better and worse that they perform87 In thinking about Moris theory through this boundarymaking and meaningmaking we return to the uncanny valley and its pre sumed originary and fixed yet in fact culturally and historically specific concept of the human When read through Barad and Such man the uncanny valleys boundary between human and nonhu man as it is mobilized in myriad robotics practices and broader cul tural discussions of human realism does not highlight an inherent and inviolable border between human and nonhuman rather the uncanny valley points to a boundary that is agentially positioned and never innocent a boundary that is produced by histories of cultural social political technoscientific and embodied labors And the uncanny valley rather than policing or fixing this boundary can in fact open up Suchmans conception of accountability urging us to critically engage the boundarys histories and the relations and tendencies toward which it orients us 85 Suchman HumanMachine Reconfigurations above n 12 p 285 86 Barad Meeting the Universe Halfway above n 42 p 187 87
