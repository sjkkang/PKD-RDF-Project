debt is to my family who have listened patiently to my ideas over the years and to my husband Nick Gessler from whom I have learned more than I can say Prologue You are alone in the room except for two computer terminals flickering in the dim light You use the terminals to communicate with two entities in an other room whom you cannot see Relying solely on their responses to your questions you must decide which is the man which the woman Or in an other version of the famous imitation game proposed by Alan Turing in his classic 1950 paper Computer Machinery and Intelligence you use the responses to decide which is the human which the machine 1 One of the entities wants to help you guess correctly Hisherlits best strategy Turing suggested may be to answer your questions truthfully The other entity wants to mislead you Hesheit will try to reproduce through the words that appear on your terminal the characteristics of the other entity Your job is to pose questions that can distinguish verbal performance from embodied reality If you cannot tell the intelligent machine from the intel ligent human your failure proves Turing argued that machines can think Here at the inaugural moment of the computer age the erasure of em bodiment is performed so that intelligence becomes a property of the formal manipulation of symbols rather than enaction in the human life world The Turing test was to set the agenda for artificial intelligence for the next three decades In the push to achieve machines that can think re searchers performed again and again the erasure of embodiment at the heart of the Turing test All that mattered was the formal generation and manipulation of informational patterns Aiding this process was a defini tion of information formalized by Claude Shannon and Norbert Wiener that conceptualized information as an entity distinct from the substrates carrying it From this formulation it was a small step to think of information as a kind of bodiless fluid that could flow between different substrates with out loss of meaning or form Writing nearly four decades after Turing Hans xi xii I Prologue Moravec proposed that human identity is essentially an informational pat tern rather than an embodied enaction The proposition can be demon strated he suggested by downloading human consciousness into a computer and he imagined a scenario designed to show that this was in principle possible The Moravec test in may call it that is the logical suc cessor to the Turing test Whereas the Turing test was designed to show that machines can perform the thinking previously considered to be an exclu sive capacity of the human mind the Moravec test was designed to show that machines can become the repository of human consciousnessthat machines can for all practical purposes become human beings You are the cyborg and the cyborg is you In the progression from Turing to Moravec the part of the Turing test that historically has been foregrounded is the distinction between thinking human and thinking machine Often forgotten is the first example Turing offered of distinguishing between a man and a woman If your failure to dis tinguish correctly between human and machine proves that machines can think what does it prove if you fail to distinguish woman from man Why does gender appear in this primal scene of humans meeting their evolu tionary successors intelligent machines What do gendered bodies have to do with the erasure of embodiment and the subsequent merging of ma chine and human intelligence in the figure of the cyborg In his thoughtful and perceptive intellectual biography of Turing Andrew Hodges suggests that Turings predilection was always to deal with the world as if it were a formal puzzle2 To a remarkable extent Hodges says Turing was blind to the distinction between saying and dOing Turing fundamentally did not understand that questions involving sex society politics or secrets would demonstrate how what it was possible for people to say might be limited not by puzzlesolving intelligence but by the restric tions on what might be done pp 42324 In a fine inSight Hodges sug gests that the discrete state machine communicating by teleprinter alone was like an ideal for Turings own life in which he would be left alone in a room of his own to deal with the outside world solely by rational argument It was the embodiment of a perfect J S Mill liberal concentrating upon the free will and free speech of the individual p 425 Turings later embroil ment with the police and court system over the question of his homosexu ality played out in a different key the assumptions embodied in the Turing test His conviction and the court ordered hormone treatments for his ho mosexuality tragically demonstrated the importance of doing over saying in the coercive order of a homophobiC society with the power to enforce its will upon the bodies of its citizens Prologue I xiii The perceptiveness of Hodgess biography notwithstanding he gives a strange interpretation of Turings inclusion of gender in the imitation game Gender according to Hodges was in fact a red herring and one of the few passages of the paper that was not expressed with perfect lucidity The whole point of this game was that a successful imitation of a womans responses by a man would not prove anything Gender depended on facts which were not reducible to sequences of symbols p 415 In the paper itself however nowhere does Turing suggest that gender is meant as a counterexample instead he makes the two cases rhetorically parallel indi cating through symmetry if nothing else that the gender and the hu manmachine examples are meant to prove the same thing Is this simply bad writing as Hodges argues an inability to express an intended opposi tion between the construction of gender and the construction of thought Or on the contrary does the writing express a parallelism too explosive and subversive for Hodges to acknowledge If so now we have two mysteries instead of one Why does Turing in clude gender and why does Hodges want to read this inclusion as indicat ing that so far as gender is concerned verbal performance cannot be equated with embodied reality One way to frame these mysteries is to see them as attempts to transgress and reinforce the boundaries of the subject respectively By including gender Turing implied that renegotiating the boundary between human and machine would involve more than trans forming the question of who can think into what can think It would also necessarily bring into question other characteristics of the liberal sub ject for it made the crucial move of distinguishing between the enacted body present in the flesh on one side of the computer screen and the rep resented body produced through the verbal and semiotic markers consti tuting it in an electronic environment This construction necessarily makes the subject into a cyborg for the enacted and represented bodies are brought into conjunction through the technology that connects them If you distinguish correctly which is the man and which the woman you in ef fect reunite the enacted and the represented bodies into a Single gender identity The very existence of the test however implies that you may also make the wrong choice Thus the test functions to create the possibility of a disjunction between the enacted and the represented bodies regardless which choice you make What the Turing test proves is that the overlay between the enacted and the represented bodies is no longer a natural in evitability but a contingent production mediated by a technology that has become so entwined with the production of identity that it can no longer meaningfully be separated from the human subject To pose the question xiv  Prologue of what can think inevitably also changes in a reverse feedback loop the terms of who can think On this view Hodgess reading of the gender test as nonsignifying with respect to identity can be seen as an attempt to safeguard the boundaries of the subject from precisely this kind of transformation to insist that the ex istence of thinking machines will not necessarily affect what being human means That Hodgess reading is a misreading indicates he is willing to prac tice violence upon the text to wrench meaning away from the direction to ward which the Turing test points back to safer ground where embodiment secures the univocality of gender I think he is wrong about embodiments securing the univocality of gender and wrong about its securing human identity but right about the importance of putting embodiment back into the picture What embodiment secures is not the distinction between male and female or between humans who can think and machines which cannot Rather embodiment makes clear that thought is a much broader cognitive function depending for its specificities on the embodied form enacting it This realization with all its exfoliating implications is so broad in its effects and so deep in its consequences that it is transforming the liberal subject regarded as the model of the human since the Enlightenment into the posthuman Think of the Turing test as a magic trick Like all good magic tricks the test relies on getting you to accept at an early stage assumptions that will de termine how you interpret what you see later The important intervention comes not when you try to determine which is the man the woman or the machine Rather the important intervention comes much earlier when the test puts you into a cybernetic circuit that splices your will desire and per ception into a distributed cognitive system in which represented bodies are joined with enacted bodies through mutating and flexible machine inter faces As you gaze at the flickering signifiers scrolling down the computer screens no matter what identifications you assign to the embodied entities that you cannot see you have already become posthuman  C b  0  p f er  Ooe TOWARD EMBODIED VIRTUALITY We need first to understand that the human formincluding human desire and all its external representationsmay be changing radically and thus must be revisioned We need to understand that five hundred years of humanism may be coming to an end as humanism transforms itself into something that we must helplessly call posthumanism Ihab Hassan Prometheus as Perfonner Towards a Posthumanist Culture This book began with a roboticists dream that struck me as a nightmare I was reading Hans Moravecs Mind Children The Future of Robot and Hu man Intelligence enjoying the ingenious variety of his robots when I hap pened upon the passage where he argues it will soon be possible to download human consciousness into a computer l To illustrate he invents a fantasy scenario in which a robot surgeon purees the human brain in a kind of cranial liposuction reading the information in each molecular layer as it is stripped away and transferring the information into a computer At the end of the operation the cranial cavity is empty and the patient now in habiting the metallic body of the computer wakens to find his conscious ness exactly the same as it was before How I asked myself was it possible for someone of Moravecs obvious intelligence to believe that mind could be separated from body Even as suming such a separation was possible how could anyone think that con sciousness in an entirely different medium would remain unchanged as if it had no connection with embodiment Shocked into awareness I began noticing he was far from alone As early as the 1950s Norbert Wiener pro posed it was theoretically possible to telegraph a human being a suggestion underlaid by the same assumptions informing Moravecs scenario2 The producers of Star Trek operate from similar premises when they imagine that the body can be dematerialized into an informational pattern and re materialized without change at a remote location Nor is the idea confined to what Beth Loffreda has called pulp science3 Much of the discourse on molecular biology treats information as the essential code the body ex presses a practice that has certain affinities with Moravecs ideas4 In fact a defining characteristic of the present cultural moment is the belief that in formation can circulate unchanged among different material substrates It is not for nothing that Beam me up Scotty has become a cultural icon for the global informational society Following this thread I was led into a maze of developments that turned into a sixyear odyssey of researching archives in the history of cybernetics interviewing scientists in computational biology and artificial life reading cultural and literary texts concerned with information technologies visit ing laboratories engaged in research on virtual reality and grappling with technical articles in cybernetics information theory autopoiesis com puter simulation and cognitive science Slowly this unruly mass of material began taking shape as three interrelated stories The first centers on how information lost its body that is how it came to be conceptualized as an en tity separate from the materialforms in which it is thought to be embedded The second story concerns how the cyborg was created as a technological artifact and cultural icon in the years follOwing World War II The third deeply implicated with the first two is the unfolding story of how a histori cally specific construction called the human is giving way to a different con struction called the posthuman Interrelations between the three stories are extensive Central to the construction of the cyborg are informational pathways connecting the or ganic body to its prosthetic extensions This presumes a conception of in formation as a disembodied entity that can flow between carbonbased organic components and siliconbased electronic components to make protein and silicon operate as a Single system When information loses its body equating humans and computers is especially easy for the materiality in which the thinking mind is instantiated appears incidental to its essential nature Moreover the idea of the feedback loop implies that the bound aries of the autonomous subject are up for grabs since feedback loops can flow not only within the subject but also between the subject and the envi ronment From Norbert Wiener on the flow of information through feed back loops has been associated with the deconstruction of the liberal humanist subject the version of the human with which I will be con cerned Although the posthuman differs in its articulations a common theme is the union of the human with the intelligent machine What is the posthuman Think of it as a point of view characterized by the follOwing assumptions I do not mean this list to be exclusive or defini tive Rather it names elements found at a variety of sites It is meant to be suggestive rather than prescriptive5 First the posthuman view privileges informational pattern over material instantiation so that embodiment in a biological substrate is seen as an accident of history rather than an in evitabilityoflife Second the posthuman view considers consciousness re Toward Embodied Virtuality I 3 garded as the seat of human identity in the Western tradition long before Descartes thought he was a mind thinking as an epiphenomenon as an evo lutionary upstart trying to claim that it is the whole show when in actuality it is only a minor sideshow Third the posthuman view thinks of the body as the original prosthesis we all learn to manipulate so that extending or re placing the body with other prostheses becomes a continuation of a process that began before we were born Fourth and most important by these and other means the posthuman view configures human being so that it can be seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines In the posthuman there are no essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily exis tence and computer simulation cybernetic mechanism and biological or ganism robot teleology and human goals To elucidate the Significant shift in underlying assumptions about sub jectivity signaled by the posthuman we can recall one of the definitive texts characterizing the liberal humanist subject C B Macphersons analysis of possessive individualism Its possessive quality is found in its conception of the individual as essentially the proprietor of his own person or capaci ties owing nothing to society for them   The human essence is freedom from the wills of others and freedom is a function of possession6 The ital icized phrases mark convenient points of departure for measuring the dis tance between the human and the posthuman Owing nothing to society comes from arguments Hobbes and Locke constructed about humans in a state of nature before market relations arose Because ownership of one self is thought to predate market relations and owe nothing to them it forms a foundation upon which those relations can be built as when one sells ones labor for wages As Macpherson points out however this imag ined state of nature is a retrospective creation of a market society The lib eral self is produced by market relations and does not in fact predate them This paradox as Macpherson calls it is resolved in the posthuman by doing away with the natural self The posthuman subject is an amalgam a collection of heterogeneous components a materialinformational entity whose boundaries undergo continuous construction and reconstruction Consider the sixmilliondollar man a paradigmatic citizen of the posthu man regime As his name implies the parts of the self are indeed owned but they are owned precisely because they were purchased not because ownership is a natural condition preexisting market relations Similarly the presumption that there is an agency desire or will belonging to the self and clearly distinguished from the wills of others is undercut in the posthu man for the posthumans collective heterogeneous quality implies a dis tributed cognition located in disparate parts that may be in only tenuous 4  Chapter One communication with one another We have only to recall Robocops mem ory flashes that interfere with his programmed directives to understand how the distributed cognition of the posthuman complicates individual agency If human essence is freedom from the wills of others the posthu man is post not because it is necessarily unfree but because there is no a priori way to identify a selfwill that can be clearly distingUished from an otherwill Although these examples foreground the cybernetic aspect of the posthuman it is important to recognize that the construction of the posthuman does not require the subject to be a literal cyborg Whether or not interventions have been made on the body new models of subjectivity emerging from such fields as cognitive science and artificial life imply that even a biologically unaltered Homo sapiens counts as posthuman The de fining characteristics involve the construction of subjectivity not the pres ence of nonbiological components What to make of this shift from the human to the posthuman which both evokes terror and excites pleasure The liberal humanist subject has of course been cogently criticized from a number of perspectives Feminist theorists have pointed out that it has historically been constructed as a white European male presuming a universality that has worked to sup press and disenfranchise womens voices postcolonial theorists have taken issue not only with the universality of the white male liberal subject but also with the very idea of a unified consistent identity fOCUSing instead on hybridity and postmodern theorists such as Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari have linked it with capitalism arguing for the liberatory potential of a dispersed subjectivity distributed among diverse desiring machines they call body without organs7 Although the deconstruction of the lib eral humanist subject in cybernetiCS has some affinities with these perspec tives it proceeded primarily along lines that sought to understand human being as a set of informational processes Because information had lost its body this construction implied that embodiment is not essential to human being Embodiment has been systematically downplayed or erased in the cybernetic construction of the posthuman in ways that have not occurred in other critiques of the liberal humanist subject espeCially in feminist and postcolonial theories Indeed one could argue that the erasure of embodiment is a feature common to both the liberal humanist subject and the cybernetic posthu man Identified with the rational mind the liberal subject possessed a body but was not usually represented as being a body Only because the body is not identified with the self is it possible to claim for the liberal subject its notorious universality a claim that depends on erasing markers of bodily Toward Embodied Virtuality  difference including sex race and ethnicity8 Gillian Brown in her influ ential study of the relation between humanism and anorexia shows that the anoretics struggle to decrement the body is possible precisely because the body is understood as an object for control and mastery rather than as an intrinsic part of the self Quoting an anoretics remarkYou make out of your body your very own kingdom where you are the tyrant the absolute dictator  Brown states Anorexia is thus a fight for selfcontrol a flight from the slavery food threatens selfsustaining selfpossession indepen dent of bodily desires is the anoretics crucial goalg In taking the selfpos session implied by liberal humanism to the extreme the anoretic creates a physical image that in its skeletal emaciation serves as material testimony that the locus of the liberal humanist subject lies in the mind not the body Although in many ways the posthuman deconstructs the liberal humanist subject it thus shares with its predecessor an emphaSiS on cognition rather than embodiment William Gibson makes the point vividly in Neuro mancer when the narrator characterizes the posthuman body as data made fleshlOTo the extent that the posthuman constructs embodiment as the instantiation of thoughtinformation it continues the liberal tradition rather than disrupts it In tracing these continuities and discontinuities between a natural self and a cybernetic posthuman I am not trying to recuperate the liberal sub ject Although I think that serious consideration needs to be given to how certain characteristics associated with the liberal subject especially agency and choice can be articulated within a posthuman context I do not mourn the passing of a concept so deeply entwined with projects of domination and oppression Rather I view the present moment as a critical juncture when interventions might be made to keep disembodiment from being rewritten once again into prevailing concepts of subjectivity I see the de construction of the liberal humanist subject as an opportunity to put back into the picture the flesh that continues to be erased in contemporary dis cussions about cybernetic subjects Hence my focus on how information lost its body for this story is central to creating what Arthur Kroker has called the flesheating 90s11 If my nightmare is a culture inhabited by posthumans who regard their bodies as fashion accessories rather than the ground of being my dream is a version of the posthuman that embraces the possibilities of information technologies without being seduced by fan tasies of unlimited power and disembodied immortality that recognizes and celebrates finitude as a condition of human being and that under stands human life is embedded in a material world of great complexity one on which we depend for our continued survival 6  Chapter One Perhaps it will now be clear that I mean my title How We Became Posthuman to connote multiple ironies which do not prevent it from also being taken seriously Taken straight this title points to models of subjec tivity sufficiently different from the liberal subject that if one assigns the term human to this subject it makes sense to call the successor posthu man Some of the historical processes leading to this transformation are documented here and in this sense the book makes good on its title Yet my argument will repeatedly demonstrate that these changes were never com plete transformations or sharp breaks without exception they reinscribed traditional ideas and assumptions even as they articulated something new The changes announced by the title thus mean something more complex than That was then this is now Rather human and posthuman coex ist in shifting configurations that vary with historically specific contexts Given these complexities the past tense in the titlebecame is in tended both to offer the reader the pleasurable shock of a double take and to reference ironically apocalyptic visions such as Moravecs prediction of a postbiological future for the human race Amplifying the ambiguities of the past tense are the ambiguities of the plural In one sense we refers to the readers of this bookreaders who by becoming aware of these new models of subjectivity if they are not al ready familiar with them may begin thinking of their actions in ways that have more in common with the posthuman than the human Speaking for myself I now find myself saying things like Well my sleep agent wants to rest but my food agent says I should go to the store Each person who thinks this way begins to envision herself or himself as a posthuman collec tivity an I transformed into the we of autonomous agents operating to gether to make a self The infectious power of this way of thinking gives we a performative dimension People become posthuman because they think they are posthuman In another sense we like became is meant ironically positioning itself in opposition to the technoecstasies found in various magazines such as Mondo 2000 which customarily speak of the transformation into the posthuman as if it were a universal human condi tion when in fact it affects only a small fraction of the worlds population a pOint to which I will return The larger trajectory of my narrative arcs from the initial moments when cybernetics was formulated as a discipline through a period of reformula tion known as secondorder cybernetics to contemporary debates swirling around an emerging discipline known as artificial life Although the progression is chronolOgical this book is not meant to be a history of cy bernetics Many figures not discussed here played important roles in that Toward Embodied Virtuality  history and I have not attempted to detail their contributions Rather my selection of theories and researchers has been dictated by a desire to show the complex interplays between embodied forms of subjectivity and argu ments for disembodiment throughout the cybernetic tradition In broad outline these interplays occurred in three distinct waves of development The first from 1945 to 1960 took homeostasis as a central concept the sec ond going roughly from 1960 to 1980 revolved around reflexivity and the third stretching from 1980 to the present highlights virtuality Let me turn now to a brief sketch of these three periods During the foundational era of cybernetics Norbert Wiener John von Neumann Claude Shannon Warren McCulloch and dozens of other distinguished researchers met at annual conferences sponsored by the JOSiah Macy Foundation to formulate the central concepts that in their high expectations would coalesce into a theory of communication and control applying equally to animals humans and machines Retrospectively called the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics these meetings held from 1943 to 1954 were instrumental in forging a new paradigm12 To succeed they needed a theory of information Shannons bailiwick a model of neural functioning that showed how neurons worked as informationprocessing systems McCullochs lifework computers that processed binary code and that could conceivably reproduce themselves thus reinforcing the analogy with biolOgical systems von Neumanns specialty and a visionary who could articulate the larger implications of the cybernetic paradigm and make clear its cosmic significance Wieners contribution The result of this breathtaking enterprise was nothing less than a new way oflooking at human beings Henceforth humans were to be seen primarily as informationpro cessing entities who are essentially similar to intelligent machines The revolutionary implications of this paradigm notwithstanding Wiener did not intend to dismantle the liberal humanist subject He was less interested in seeing humans as machines than he was in fashioning hu man and machine alike in the image of an autonomous selfdirected indi vidual In aligning cybernetiCS with liberal humanism he was following a strain of thought that since the Enlightenment had argued that human be ings could be trusted with freedom because they and the social structures they devised operated as selfregulating mechanisms 13 For Wiener cy bernetics was a means to extend liberal humanism not subvert it The point was less to show that man was a machine than to demonstrate that a ma chine could function like a man Yet the cybernetic perspective had a certain inexorable lOgiC that espe cially when fed by wartime hysteria also worked to undermine the very lib 8  Chapter One eral subjectivity that Wiener wanted to preserve These tensions were kept under control during the Macy period partly through a strong emphasis on homeostasis 14 Traditionally homeostasis had been understood as the ability ofliving organisms to maintain steady states when they are buffeted by fickle environments When the temperature soars sweat pours out of the human body so that its internal temperature can remain relatively stable During the Macy period the idea of homeostasis was extended to machines Like ani mals machines can maintain homeostasis using feedback loops Feedback loops had long been exploited to increase the stability of mechanical systems reaching a high level of development during the midtoIate nineteenth cen tury with the growing sophistication of steam engines and their accompany ing control devices such as governors It was not until the 1930s and 1940s however that the feedback loop was explicitly theorized as a flow of informa tion Cybernetics was born when nineteenthcentury control theory joined with the nascent theory of information IS Coined from the Creek word for steersman cybernetics signaled that three powerful actorsinformation control and communicationwere now operating jointly to bring about an unprecedented synthesis of the organic and the mechanical Although the informational feedback loop was initially linked with homeostasis it quickly led to the more threatening and subversive idea of reflexivity A few years ago I cotaught with a philosopher and a phYSiCist a course on reflexivity As we discussed reflexivity in the writings of Aristotle Fichte Kierkegaard Codel Turing Borges and Calvino aided by the in sightful analyses of Roger Penrose and Douglas Hofstader I was struck not only by the concepts extraordinarily rich history but also by its tendency to mutate so that virtually any formulation is sure to leave out some relevant instances Instructed by the experience I offer the follOwing tentative def inition which I hope will prove adequate for our purposes here Reflexivity is the rrwvement whereby that which has been used to generate a system is made through a changed perspective to become part of the system it gen erates When Kurt Codel invented a method of coding that allowed state ments of number theory also to function as statements about number theory he entangled that which generates the system with the system When M C Escher drew two hands drawing each other he took that which is presumed to generate the picturethe sketching handand made it part of the picture it draws When Jorge Luis Borges in The Circular Ru ins imagines a narrator who creates a student through his dreaming only to discover that he himself is being dreamed by another the system gene rat  ing a reality is shown to be part of the reality it makes As these examples il lustrate reflexivity has subversive effects because it confuses and entangles Toward Embodied Virtuality  world Reflexivity tends notoriously toward infinite regress The dreamer creates the student but the dreamer in tum is dreamed by another who in his tum is dreamed by someone else and so on to infinity This definition of reflexivity has much in common with some of the most influential and provocative recent work in critical theory cultural studies and the social studies of science Typically these works make the reflexive move of showing that an attribute previously considered to have emerged from a set of preexisting conditions is in fact used to generate the condi tions In Nancy Armstrongs Desire and Domestic Fiction A Political His tory of the Novel for example bourgeOiS femininity is shown to be constructed through the domestic fictions that represent it as already in place16 In Michael Warners The Letters of the RepubliC Publication and the Public Sphere in EighteenthCentury America the founding document of the United States the Constitution is shown to produce the very people whose existence it presupposes17 In Bruno Latours Science in Action How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society scientific experi ments are shown to produce the nature whose existence they predicate as their condition of possibility 18 It is only a slight exaggeration to say that contemporary critical theory is produced by the reflexivity that it also pro duces an observation that is of course also reflexive Reflexivity entered cybernetics primarily through discussions about the observer By and large firstwave cybernetics followed traditional scientific protocols in considering observers to be outside the system they observe Yet cybernetics also had implications that subverted this premise The objectivist view sees information flOwing from the system to the ob servers but feedback can also loop through the observers drawing them in to become part of the system being observed Although participants re marked on this aspect of the cybernetic paradigm throughout the Macy transcripts they lacked a single word to describe it To my knowledge the word reflexivity does not appear in the transcripts This meant they had no handle with which to grasp this slippery concept no Signifier that would help to constitute as well as to describe the changed perspective that reflexivity entails Discussions of the idea remained diffuse Most participants did not go beyond remarking on the shifting boundaries between observer and sys tem that cybernetics puts into play With some exceptions deeper formula tions of the problem failed to coalesce during the Macy discussions The most notable exception turned out to hurt more than it helped Lawrence Kubie a hardline Freudian psychoanalyst introduced a re flexive perspective when he argued that every utterance is doubly encoded  Chapter One acting both as a statement about the outside world and as a mirror reflecting the speakers psyche If reflexivity was already a subversive concept this in terpretation made it doubly so for it threatened to dissolve the premise of scientific objectivity shared by the physical scientists in the Macy group Their reactions to Kubies presentations show them shying away from re flexivity preferring to shift the conversation onto more comfortable ground Nevertheless the idea hung in the air and a few key thinkersespecially Margaret Mead Gregory Bateson and Heinz von Foersterresolved to pursue it after the Macy Conferences ran out of steam The second wave of cybernetics grew out of attempts to incorporate re flexivity into the cybernetic paradigm at a fundamental level The key issue was how systems are constituted as such and the key problem was how to redefine homeostatic systems so that the observer can be taken into account The second wave was initiated by among others Heinz von Foerster the Austrian emigre who became coeditor of the Macy tran scripts This phase can be dated from 1960 when von Foerster wrote the first of the essays that were later collected in his influential book Observing Systems 19 As von Foersters punning title recognizes the observer of sys tems can himself be constituted as a system to be observed Von Foerster called the models he presented in these essays secondorder cybernetics because they extended cybernetic principles to the cyberneticians them selves The second wave reached its mature phase with the publication of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varelas Autopoiesis and Cognition The Realization of the Living 20 Building on Maturanas work on reflexivity in sensory processing and Varelas on the dynamics of autonomous biologi cal systems the two authors expanded the reflexive tum into a fully articu lated epistemology that sees the world as a set of informationally closed systems Organisms respond to their environment in ways determined by their internal selforganization Their one and only goal is continually to produce and reproduce the organization that defines them as systems Hence they not only are selforganizing but also are autopoietic or self making Through Maturana and Varelas work and that of other influential theorists such as German SOCiologist Niklas Luhmann21 cybernetics by 1980 had spun off from the idea of reflexive feedback loops a theory of au topoiesis with sweeping epistemological implications In a sense autopoiesis turns the cybernetic paradigm inside out Its cen tral premisethat systems are informationally closedradically alters the idea of the informational feedback loop for the loop no longer func tions to connect a system to its environment In the autopoietic view no information crosses the boundary separating the system from its environ Toward Embodied Virtuality  I ment We do not see a world out there that exists apart from us Rather we see only what our systemic organization allows us to see The environ ment merely triggers changes determined by the systems own structural properties Thus the center of interest for autopoiesis shifts from the cy bernetics of the observed system to the cybernetics of the observer Au topoiesis also changes the explanation of what circulates through the system to make it work as a system The emphasis now is on the mutually constitutive interactions between the components of a system rather than on message signal or information Indeed one could say either that infor mation does not exist in this paradigm or that it has sunk so deeply into the system as to become indistinguishable from the organizational properties defining the system as such The third wave swelled into existence when selforganization began to be understood not merely as the reproduction of internal organization but as the springboard to emergence In the rapidly emerging field of arti ficiallife computer programs are designed to allow creatures that is dis crete packets of computer codes to evolve spontaneously in directions the programmer may not have anticipated The intent is to evolve the capacity to evolve Some researchers have argued that such selfevolving programs are not merely models oflife but are themselves alive What assumptions make this claim plausible If one sees the universe as composed essentially of information it makes sense that these creatures are life forms because they have the form oflife that is an informational code As a result the the oretical bases used to categorize all life undergo a significant shift As we shall see in chapters 9 and 10 when these theories are applied to human be ings H onw sapiens are so transfigured in conception and purpose that they can appropriately be called posthuman The emergence of the posthuman as an informationalmaterial entity is paralleled and reinforced by a corresponding reinterpretation of the deep structures of the phYSical world Some theorists notably Edward Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram claim that reality is a program run on a cosmic com puter22 In this view a universal informational code underlies the structure of matter energy spacetimeindeed of everything that exists The code is instantiated in cellular automata elementary units that can occupy two states on or off Although the jury is still out on the cellular automata model it may indeed prove to be a robust way to understand reality Even now a re search team headed by Fredkin is working on shOwing how quantum me chanics can be derived from an underlying cellular automata model What happens to the embodied lifeworld of humans in this paradigm In itself the cellular automata model is not necessarily incompatible with  Chapter One recognizing that humans are embodied beings for embodiment can flow from cellular automata as easily as from atoms No one suggests that be cause atoms are mostly empty space we can shuck the electron shells and do away with occupying space altogether Yet the cultural contexts and technological histories in which cellular automata theories are embedded encourage a comparable fantasythat because we are essentially inform a tion we can do away with the body Central to this argument is a conceptu alization that sees information and materiality as distinct entities This separation allows the construction of a hierarchy in which information is given the dominant position and materiality runs a distant second As though we had learned nothing from Derrida about supplementarity em bodiment continues to be discussed as if it were a supplement to be purged from the dominant term of information an accident of evolution we are now in a position to correct It is this materialityinformation separation that I want to contestnot the cellular automata model information theory or a host of related theo ries in themselves My strategy is to complicate the leap from embodied re ality to abstract information by pointing to moments when the assumptions involved in this move were contested by other researchers in the field and so became especially visible The point of highlighting such moments is to make clear how much had to be erased to arrive at such abstractions as bod iless information Abstraction is of course an essential component in all theOrizing for no theory can account for the infinite multiplicity of our in teractions with the real But when we make moves that erase the worlds multiplicity we risk losing Sight of the variegated leaves fractal branchings and particular bark textures that make up the forest In the pages that fol low I will identifY two moves in particular that played important roles in constructing the informationmateriality hierarchy Irreverently I think of them as the Platonic backhand and forehand The Platonic backhand works by inferring from the worlds noisy multi plicity a Simplified abstraction So far so good this is what theOrizing should do The problem comes when the move circles around to constitute the ab straction as the originary form from which the worlds multiplicity derives Then complexity appears as a fuzzing up of an essential reality rather than as a manifestation of the worlds holistic nature Whereas the platonic backhand has a history dating back to the Greeks the Platonic forehand is more recent To reach fully developed form it required the assistance of powerful comput ers This move starts from simplified abstractions and using simulation tech niques such as genetic algorithms evolves a multiplicity sufficiently complex that it can be seen as a world ofits own The two moves thus make their play in Toward Embodied Virtuality  opposite directions The backhand goes from noisy multiplicity to reductive simplicity whereas the forehand swings from simplicity to mulilicity They share a common ideologyprivileging the abstract as the Real and down playing the importance of material instantiation When they work together they lay the groundwork for a new variation on an ancient game in which dis embodied information becomes the ultimate Platonic Form If we can cap ture the Form of ones and zeros in a nonbiological mediumsay on a computer diskwhy do we need the bodys superfluous flesh Whether the enabling assumptions for this conception of information occur in information theory cybernetics or popular science books such as Mind Children their appeal is clear Information viewed as pattern and not tied to a particular instantiation is information free to travel across time and space Hackers are not the only ones who believe that information wants to be free The great dream and promise of information is that it can be free from the material constraints that govern the mortal world Marvin Minsky precisely expressed this dream when in a recent lecture he suggested it will soon be possible to extract human memories from the brain and import them intact and unchanged to computer disks23 The clear implication is that if we can become the information we have constructed we can achieve effective immortality In the face of such a powerful dream it can be a shock to remember that for information to exist it must always be instantiated in a medium whether that medium is the page from the Bell Laboratories Journal on which Shannons equations are printed the computergenerated topolOgi cal maps used by the Human Genome Project or the cathode ray tube on which virtual worlds are imaged The point is not only that abstracting in formation from a material base is an imaginary act but also and more fun damentally that conceiving of information as a thing separate from the medium instantiating it is a prior imaginary act that constructs a holistic phenomenon as an informationmatter duality24 The chapters that follow will show what had to be elided suppressed and forgotten to make information lose its body This book is a rememory in the sense of Toni Morrisons Beloved putting back together parts that have lost touch with one another and reaching out toward a complexity too unruly to fit into disembodied ones and zeros Seriation Skeuomorphs and Conceptual Constellations The foregOing leads to a strategic definition of virtuality Virtuality is the cultural perception that material objects are interpenetrated by informa tion patterns The definition plays off the duality at the heart of the condi tion of virtualitymateriality on the one hand information on the other Normally virtuality is associated with computer simulations that put the body into a feedback loop with a computergenerated image For example in virtual PingPong one swings a paddle wired into a computer which cal culates from the paddles momentum and position where the ball would go Instead of hitting a real ball the player makes the appropriate motions with the paddle and watches the image of the ball on a computer monitor Thus the game takes place partly in real life RL and partly in virtual reality VR Virtual reality technologies are fascinating because they make visually im mediate the perception that a world of information exists parallel to the real world the former intersecting the latter at many points and in many ways Hence the definitions strategic quality strategic because it seeks to connect virtual technologies with the sense pervasive in the late twentieth century that all material objects are interpenetrated by flows of informa tion from DNA code to the global reach of the World Wide Web Seeing the world as an interplay between informational patterns and material objects is a histOrically specific construction that emerged in the wake of World War II 25 By 1948 the distinction had coalesced suffiCiently for Wiener to articulate it as a criterion that any adequate theory of materi ality would be forced to meet Information is information not matter or energy No materialism which does not admit this can survive at the present day26 Wiener knew as well as anyone else that to succeed this conception of information required artifacts that could embody it and make it real When I say virtuality is a cultural perception I do not mean that it is merely a psychological phenomenon It is instantiated in an array of powerful tech nologies The perception of virtuality facilitates the development of virtual technolOgies and the technologies reinforce the perception The feedback loops that run between technologies and perceptions ar tifacts and ideas have important implications for how historical change oc curs The development of cybernetics followed neither a Kuhnian model of incommensurable paradigms nor a Foucauldian model of sharp epistemic breaks27 In the history of cybernetics ideas were rarely made up out of whole cloth Rather they were fabricated in a pattern of overlapping repli cation and innovation a pattern that I call seriation a term appropriated from archaeolOgical anthropology A brief explanation may clarifY this concept Within archaeolOgical anthropology changes in artifacts are cus tomarily mapped through seriation charts One constructs a seriation chart by parsing an artifact as a set of attributes that change over time Suppose a researcher wants to construct a seriation chart for lamps A key attribute is Toward Embodied Virtuality I the element that gives off light The first lamps dating from thousands of years ago used wicks for this element Later with the discovery of electric ity wicks gave way to filaments The figures that customarily emerge from this kind of analysis are shaped like a tigers irisnarrow at the top when an attribute first begins to be introduced with a bulge in the middle during the heyday of the attribute and tapered off at the bottom as the shift to a new model is completed On a seriation chart for lamps a line drawn at 1890 would show the figure for wicks waxing large with the figure for filaments intersected at the narrow tip of the top end Fiftyyears later the wick figure would be tapering off and the filament figure would be widening into its middle section Considered as a set the figures depicting changes in the at tributes of an artifact reveal patterns of overlapping innovation and replica tion Some attributes change from one model to the next but others remain the same As figure 1 illustrates the conceptual shifts that took place during the development of cybernetics display a seriated pattern reminiscent of mate rial changes in artifacts Conceptual fields evolve similarly to material cul ture in part because concept and artifact engage each other in continuous feedback loops An artifact materially expresses the concept it embodies but the process of its construction is far from passive A glitch has to be fixed a material exhibits unexpected properties an emergent behavior sur facesany of these challenges can give rise to a new concept which results in another generation of artifact which leads to the development of still other concepts The reasoning suggests that we should be able to trace the development of a conceptual field by using a seriation chart analogous to the seriation charts used for artifacts In the course of the Macy Conferences certain ideas came to be associ ated with each other Through a cumulative process that continued across several years of discussions these ideas were seen as mutually entailing each other until like love and marriage they were viewed by the partici pants as naturally going together Such a constellation is the conceptual en tity corresponding to an artifact possessing an internal coherence that defines it as an operational unit Its formation marks the beginning of a pe riod its disassembly and reconstruction Signal the transition to a different period Indeed periods are recognizable as such largely because constel lations possess this coherence Rarely is a constellation discarded whole sale Rather some of the ideas composing it are discarded others are modified and new ones are introduced Like the attributes composing an artifact the ideas in a constellation change in a patchwork pattern of old and new Period Self Organization signalnoise circular causality instrumental language Constellations Reflexivity Virtuality FIGURE 1 The three waves of cybernetics Artifacts electronic rat homeostat electric tortoise frogs visual cortex simulation mobile robot Skeuomorphs mallillthemiddle homeostasis selforgallizatioll Toward Embodied Virtuality  Here I want to introduce another term from archaeological anthropol ogy A skeuonwryh is a design feature that is no longer functional in itself but that refers back to a feature that was functional at an earlier time The dashboard of my Toyota Camry for example is covered by vinyl molded to simulate stitching The simulated stitching alludes back to a fabric that was in fact stitched although the vinyl stitching is formed by an injection mold Skeuomorphs visibly testify to the social or psychological necessity for innovation to be tempered by replication Like anachronisms their pe jorative first cousins skeuomorphs are not unusual On the contrary they are so deeply characteristic of the evolution of concepts and artifacts that it takes a great deal of conscious effort to avoid them At SIGGRAPH the annual computer trade show where dealers come to hawk their wares hard and soft there are almost as many skeuomorphs as morphs The complex psychological functions a skeuomorph performs can be illustrated by an installation exhibited at SIGGRAPH 93 Called the Catholic Turing Test the simulation invited the viewer to make a confes sion by chOOSing selections from the video screen it even had a bench on which the viewer could kneel 28 On one level the installation alluded to the triumph of science over religion for the role of divinely authorized interro gation and absolution had been taken over by a machine algorithm On an other level the installation pointed to the intransigence of conditioned behavior for the machines form and function were determined by its reli gious predecessor Like a Janus figure the skeuomorph looks to past and future Simultaneously reinforcing and undermining both It calls into a playa psychodynamic that finds the new more acceptable when it recalls the old that it is in the process of displacing and finds the traditional more comfortable when it is presented in a context that reminds us we can escape from it into the new In the history of cybernetics skeuomorphs acted as threshold devices smoothing the transition between one conceptual constellation and an other Homeostasis a foundational concept during the first wave func tioned during the second wave as a skeuomotph Although homeostasis remained an important concept in biology by about 1960 it had ceased to be an initiating premise in cybernetics Instead it performed the work of a gesture or an allusion used to authenticate new elements in the emerging constellation of reflexivity At the same time it also exerted an inertial pull on the new elements limiting how radically they could transform the con stellation A similar phenomenon appears in the transition from the second to the third wave Reflexivity the key concept of the second wave is displaced in the third wave by emergence Like homeostasis reRexivity does not alto gether disappear but lingers on as an allusion that authenticates new ele ments It performs a more complex role than mere nostalgia however for it also leaves its imprint on the new constellation of virtuality The complex story formed by these seriated changes is told in chapters 3 6 and 9 which discuss cybernetics autopoiesis and artificial life respectively I have already suggested that living in a condition of virtuality implies we participate in the cultural perception that information and materiality are conceptually distinct and that information is in some sense more essential more important and more fundamental than materiality The preamble to A Magna Carta for the Knowledge Age a document coauthored by Alvin TofHer at the behest of Newt Gingrich concisely sums up the matter by proclaiming The central event of the 20th century is the overthrow of matter29 To see how this view began to acquire momentum let us brieRy Rash back to 1948 when Claude Shannon a brilliant theorist working at Bell Laboratories defined a mathematical quantity he called information and proved several important theorems concerning it3o Information Theory and Everyday Life Shannons theory defines information as a probability function with no di mensions no materiality and no necessary connection with meaning It is a pattern not a presence Chapter 3 talks about the development of infor mation theory in more detail and the relevant equations can be found there The theory makes a strong distinction between message and signal Lacan to the contrary a message does not always arrive at its destination In information theoretic terms no message is ever sent What is sent is a sig nal Only when the message is encoded in a Signal for transmission through a mediumfor example when ink is printed on paper or when electrical pulses are sent racing along telegraph wiresdoes it assume material form The very definition of information then encodes the distinction between materiality and information that was also becoming important in molecular biology during this period31 Why did Shannon define information as a pattern The transcripts of the Macy Conferences indicate that the choice was driven by the twin engines of reliable quantification and theoretical generality As we shall see in chap ter 3 Shannons formulation was not the only proposal on the table Donald MacKay a British researcher argued for an alternative definition that linked information with change in a receivers mindset and thus with meaning32 To be workable MacKays definition required that psychologi Toward Embodied Virtuality  cal states be quantifiable and measurablean accomplishment that only now appears distantly possible with such imaging technologies as positron emission tomography and that certainly was not in reach in the immediate postWorld War II years It is no mystery why Shannons definition rather than MacKays became the industry standard Shannons approach had other advantages that turned out to incur large and mounting costs when his premise interacted with certain predisposi tions already at work within the culture Abstracting information from a material base meant that information could become freefloating unaf fected by changes in context The technical leverage this move gained was considerable for by formalizing information into a mathematical function Shannon was able to develop theorems powerful in their generality that hold true regardless of the medium in which the information is instanti ated Not everyone agreed this move was a good idea however despite its theoretical power As Carolyn Marvin  Chapter One such as Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and Bell Laboratories most ma jor research universities and hundreds of corporations have so thoroughly incorporated virtual technologies into their infrastructures that informa tion is as much as part of the researchers mindscapes as is electric lighting or synthetic plastics35 The thirty million Americans who are plugged into the Internet increasingly engage in virtual experiences enacting a division between the material body that exits on one side of the screen and the com puter simulacra that seem to create a space inside the screen36 Yet for mil lions more virtuality is not even a cloud on the horizon of their everyday worlds Within a global context the experience of virtuality becomes more exotic by several orders of magnitude It is a useful corrective to remember that 70 percent of the worlds population has never made a telephone call Nevertheless I think it is a mistake to underestimate the importance of virtuality for it wields an influence altogether disproportionate to the num ber of people immersed in it It is no accident that the condition of virtual ity is most pervasive and advanced where the centers of power are most concentrated Theorists at the Pentagon for example see it as the theater in which future wars will be fought They argue that coming conflicts will be decided not so much by overwhelming force as by neocortical warfare waged through the technosciences of information 37 If we want to contest what these technologies SignifY we need histories that show the erasures that went into creating the condition of virtuality as well as visions arguing for the importance of embodiment Once we understand the complex in terplays that went into creating the condition of virtuality we can demystifY our progress toward virtuality and see it as the result of historically specific negotiations rather than of the irresistible force of technological determin ism At the same time we can acquire resources with which to rethink the assumptions underlying virtuality and we can recover a sense of the virtual that fully recognizes the importance of the embodied processes constitut ing the lifeworld of human beings38 In the phrase virtual bodies I intend to allude to the historical separation between information and materiality and also to recall the embodied processes that resist this division Virtuality and Contemporary Literature I have already suggested that one way to think about the organization of this book is chronologically since it follows the three waves of seriated changes in cybernetics In this organization of the textual body each of the three chronologically arranged divisions has an anchOring chapter discussing the scientific theories on the Macy Conferences chapter 3 on autopoiesis Toward Embodied Virtuality   chapter 6 and on artificial life chapter 9 respectively Each section also has a chapter showing specific applications of the theories the work of Norbert Wiener chapter 4 taperecording technologies chapter 8 and humancomputer interactions chapter 10 Also included in each of the three divisions are chapters on literary texts contemporaneous with the development of the scientific theories and cybernetic technolOgies chap ters 57 and 10 I have selected literary texts that were clearly influenced by the development of cybernetics Nevertheless I want to resist the idea that influence flows from science into literature The crosscurrents are conSiderably more complex than a oneway model of influence would al low In the Neuromancer trilogy for example William Gibsons vision of cyberspace had a considerable effect on the development of threedim en sional virtual reality imaging software 39 A second way to think about the organization of How We Became Posthuman is narratively In this arrangement the three divisions proceed not so much through chronolOgical progression as through the narrative strands about the lost body of information the cyborg body and the posthuman body Here the literary texts playa central role for they display the passageways that enabled stories coming out of narrowly focused scien tific theories to circulate more widely through the body politic Many of the scientists understood very well that their negotiations involved premises broader than the formal scope of their theories strictly allowed Because of the wedge that has been driven between science and values in US culture their statements on these wider implications necessarily occupied the posi tion of ad hoc pronouncements rather than scientific arguments Shaped by different conventions the literary texts range across a spectrum ofissues that the scientific texts only fitfully illuminate including the ethical and cul tural implications of cybernetiC technologies4o Literary texts are not of course merely passive conduits They actively shape what the technolOgies mean and what the scientific theories signify in cultural contexts They also embody assumptions similar to those that permeated the scientific theories at critical points These assumptions in cluded the idea that stability is a desirable social goal that human beings and human social organizations are selforganizing structures and that form is more essential than matter The scientific theories used these as sumptions as enabling presuppositions that helped to gUide inquiry and shape research agendas As the chapters on the scientific developments will show culture circulates through science no less than science circulates through culture The heart that keeps this circulatory system flOwing is narrativenarratives about culture narratives within culture narratives 22  Chapter One about science narratives within science In my account of the scientific de velopments I have sought to emphasize the role that narrative plays in articulating the posthuman as a technicalcultural concept For example chapter 4 on Wieners scientific work is interlaced with analyses of the nar ratives he tells to resolve conflicts between cybernetics and liberal human ism and chapter 9 on artificial life is organized by looking at this area of research as a narrative field What does this emphasis on narrative have to do with virtual bodies FollOwing J eanFrancois Lyotard many theorists of postmodernity accept that the postmodern condition implies an incredulity toward metanarra tive41 As we have seen one way to construct virtuality is the way that Moravec and Minsky doas a metanarrative about the transformation of the human into a disembodied posthuman I think we should be skeptical about this metanarrative To contest it I want to use the resources of narra tive itself particularly its resistance to various forms of abstraction and dis embodiment With its chronolOgical thrust polymorphous digreSSions located actions and personified agents narrative is a more embodied form of discourse than is analytically driven systems theory By turning the tech nolOgical determinism of bodiless information the cyborg and the post human into narratives about the negotiations that took place between particular people at particular times and places I hope to replace a teleol ogy of disembodiment with historically contingent stories about contests between competing factions contests whose outcomes were far from obvi ous Many factors affected the outcomes from the needs of emerging tech nologies for reliable quantification to the personalities of the people involved Though overdetermined the disembodiment ofinformation was not inevitable any more than it is inevitable we continue to accept the idea that we are essentially informational patterns In this regard the literary texts do more than explore the cultural impli cations of scientific theories and technolOgical artifacts Embedding ideas and artifacts in the situated specificities of narrative the literary texts give these ideas and artifacts a local habitation and a name through discursive formulations whose effects are specific to that textual body In explOring these effects I want to demonstrate on multiple levels and in many ways that abstract pattern can never fully capture the embodied actuality unless it is as prolix and noisy as the body itself Shifting the emphaSiS from tech nolOgical determinism to competing contingent embodied narratives about the scientific developments is one way to liberate the resources of narrative so that they work against the grain of abstraction running through the teleology of disembodiment Another way is to read literary texts along Toward Embodied Virtuality I side scientific theories In articulating the connections that run through these two discursive realms I want to entangle abstract form and material particularity such that the reader will find it increaSingly difficult to main tain the perception that they are separate and discrete entities If for cul tural and historical reasons I cannot start from a holistic perspective I hope to mix things up enough so that the emphasis falls not on the separa tion of matter and information but on their inextricably complex com poundings and entwinings For this project the literary texts with their fashionings of embodied particularities are crucial The first literary text I discuss in detail is Bernard Wolfes Limbo 42 Writ ten in the 1950s Limbo has become something of an underground classic It imagines a postwar society in which an ideology Immob has developed the ideology equates aggression with the ability to move Pacifism equals passivity Immob slogans declare True believers volunteer to banish their mobility and presumably their aggreSSion by having amputations which have come to be regarded as signifiers of social power and influence These amputees get bored with lying around however so a vigorous cyberneticS industry has grown up to replace their missing limbs As this brief summary suggests Limbo is deeply influenced by cybernetiCS But the technical achievements of cybernetics are not at the center of the text Rather they serve as a springboard to explore a variety of social political and psycho logical issues ranging from the perceived threat that womens active sexu ality poses for Immob men to global EastWest tensions that explode into another world war at the end of the text Although it is unusually didactic Limbo does more than discuss cyberneticS it engages a full range of rhetor ical and narrative devices that work both with and against its explicit pro nouncements The narrator seems only partially able to control his verbally extravagant narrative There are I will argue deep connections between the narrators struggle to maintain control of the narrative and the threat to natural body boundaries posed by the cybernetiC paradigm Limbo in terrogates a dynamiC that also appears in Norbert Wieners workthe in tense anxiety that erupts when the perceived boundaries of the body are breached In addition it illustrates how the body of the text gets implicated in the processes used to represent bodies within the text Several Philip K Dick novels written from 1962 to 1966 including We Can Build You Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Dr Blood rooney and Ubik provide another set of texts through which the multiple implications of the posthuman can be explored43 Chronologically and the matically Dicks novels of simulation cross the scientific theory of au topoiesis Like Maturana Varela and other scientific researchers in the second wave of cybernetics Dick is intensely concerned with epistemolog ical questions and their relation to the cybernetic paradigm The problem of where to locate the observerin or out of the system being observed is conflated in his fiction with how to determine whether a creature is an droid or human For Dick the android is deeply bound up with the gender politics of his male protagonists relations with female characters who am biguously figure either as sympathetic lifegiving darkhaired girls or emotionally cold lifethreatening schizoid women Already fascinated with epistemological questions that reveal how shaky our constructions of reality can be Dick is drawn to cybernetic themes because he understands that cybernetics radically destabilizes the ontolOgical foundations of what counts as human The gender politics he writes into his novels illustrate the potent connections between cybernetics and contemporary understand ings of race gender and sexuality The chapter on contemporary speculative fictions constructs a semiotics of virtuality by shOwing how the central concepts ofinformation and materi ality can be mapped onto a multilayered semiotic square The tutor texts for this analYSis which include Snow Crash Blood Music Galatea 22 and Ter minal Games indicate the range of what counts as the posthuman in the age of virtuality from neural nets to hackers biolOgically modified humans and entities who live only in computer simulations44 In follOwing the construc tion of the posthuman in these texts I will argue that older ideas are rein scribed as well as contested As was the case for the scientific models change occurs in a seriated pattern of overlapping innovation and replication I hope that this book will demonstrate once again how crucial it is to recognize interrelations between different kinds of cultural productions specifically literature and science The stories I tell herehow informa tion lost its body how the cyborg was created as a cultural icon and techno lOgical artifact and how humans became posthumansand the waves of historical change I chart would not have the same resonance or breadth if they had been pursued only through literary texts or only through scientific discourses The scientific texts often reveal as literature cannot the foun dational assumptions that gave theoretical scope and artifactual efficacy to a particular approach The literary texts often reveal as scientific work can not the complex cultural social and representational issues tied up with conceptual shifts and technological innovations From my point of view lit erature and science as an area of specialization is more than a subset of cul tural studies or a minor activity in a literature department It is a way of understanding ourselves as embodied creatures living within and through embodied worlds and embodied words  ChQpreL  Two VIRTUAL BODIES AND FLICKERING SIGNIFIERS We might regard patterning or predictability as the very essence and raison d etre of communication   communication is the creation of redundancy orpatteming Gregory Bateson Steps to an Ecology of Mind The development of information theory in the wake of World War II left as its legacy a conundrum even though information provides the basis for much of contemporary US society it has been constructed never to be present in itself In information theoretic terms as we saw in chapter 1 information is conceptually distinct from the markers that embody it for example newsprint or electromagnetic waves It is a pattern rather than a presence defined by the probability distribution of the coding elements composing the message If information is pattern then noninformation should be the absence of pattern that is randomness This commonsense expectation ran into unexpected complications when certain devel opments within information theory implied that information could be equated with randomness as well as with pattern 1 Identifying information with both pattern and randomness proved to be a powerful paradox lead ing to the realization that in some instances an infusion of noise into a sys tem can cause it to reorganize at a higher level of complexity 2 Within such a system pattern and randomness are bound together in a complex dialec tic that makes them not so much opposites as complements or supplements to one another Each helps to define the other each contributes to the flow of information through the system Were this dialectical relation only an aspect of the formal theory its im pact might well be limited to the problems of maximizing channel utility and minimizing noise that concern electrical engineers Through the de velopment of information technologies however the interplay between pattern and randomness became a feature of everyday life As Friedrich Kittler has demonstrated in Discourse Networks 180011900 media come into existence when technologies of inscription intervene between the hand gripping the pen or the mouth framing the sounds and the production of the texts In a literal sense technologies of inscription are media when they are perceived as mediating inserting themselves into the chain oftex tual production Kittleridentifies the innovative characteristics of the type writer originally designed for the blind not with speed but rather with spatially designated and discrete signs along with a corresponding shift from the word as HOwing image to the word as a geometrical figure created by the spatial arrangements of the letter keys here Kittler quotes Richard Herbertz3 The emphasis on spatially fixed and geometrically arranged letters is significant fOritpoints to the physicality of the processes involved Typewriter keys are directly proportionate to the script they produce One keystroke yields one letter and striking the key harder produces a darker letter The system lends itself to a signification model that links Signifier to Signified in direct correspondence for there is a onetoone relation be tween the key and the letter it produces Moreover the Signifier itself is spatially discrete durably inscribed and Hat How does this experience change with electronic media The relation between striking a key and producing text with a computer is very different from the relation achieved with a typewriter Display brightness is unre lated to keystroke pressure and striking a Single key can effect massive changes in the entire text The computer restores and heightens the sense of word as imagean image drawn in a medium as Huid and changeable as water4 Interacting with electronic images rather than with a materially re sistant text I absorb through my fingers as well as my mind a model of sig nification in which no simple onetoone correspondence exists between signifier and Signified I know kinesthetically as well as conceptually that the text can be manipulated in ways that would be impossible if it existed as a material object rather than a visual display As I work with the textas Hickeringimage I instantiate within my body the habitual patterns of movement that make pattern and randomness more real more relevant and more powerful than presence and absence The technolOgies of virtual reality with their potential for fullbody me diation further illustrate the kind of phenomena that foreground pattern and randomness and make presence and absence seem irrelevant Already an industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars virtual reality puts the users sensory system into a direct feedback loop with a computer5 In one version the user wears a stereovision helmet and a body glove with sensors at joint positions The users movements are reproduced by a simulacrum called an avatar on the computer screen When the user turns his or her head the computer display changes in a corresponding fashion At the same time audiophones create a threedimensional sound field Kines Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier I thetic sensations such as GIoads for flight simulators can be supplied through more extensive and elaborate body coverings The result is a mul tisensory interaction that creates the illusion that the user is inside the com puter From my experience with the virtual reality simulations at the Human Interface Technology Laboratory and elsewhere I can attest to the disorienting exhilarating effect of the feeling that subjectivity is dispersed throughout the cybernetic circuit In these systems the user learns kines thetically and proprioceptively that the relevant boundaries for interaction are defined less by the skin than by the feedback loops connecting body and simulation in a technobiointegrated circuit Questions about presence and absence do not yield much leverage in this situation for the avatar both is and is not present just as the user both is and is not inside the screen Instead the focus shifts to questions about pattern and randomness What transformations govern the connections between user and avatar What parameters control the construction of the screen world What patterns can the user discover through interaction with the system Where do these patterns fade into randomness What stimuli cannot be encoded within the system and therefore exist only as ex traneous noise When and how does this noise coalesce into pattern Working from a different theoretical framework Allucquere Roseanne Stone has proposed that one need not enter virtual reality to encounter these questions although VR brings them vividly into the foreground Merely communicating by email or participating in a textbased MUD multiuser dungeon already problematizes thinking of the body as a self evident physicality6 In the face of such technologies Stone proposes that we think of subjectivity as a multiple warranted by the body rather than contained within it Sherry Turkle in her faSCinating work on people who spend serious time in MUDs convincingly shows that virtual technologies in a riptide of reverse influence affect how real life is seen Reality is not my best window one of her respondents remarks 7 In societies enmeshed within information networks as the US and other first world

than through eyewitness accounts 28  Chapter Two verifYing their presence access to computer networks rather than physical possession of data determines ninetenths of computer law9 sexual rela tionships are pursued through the virtual spaces of computer networks rather than through meetings at which the participants are physically pre sent 10 The effect of these transformations is to create a highly heteroge neous and fissured space in which discursive formations based on pattern and randomness jostle and compete with formations based on presence and absence Given the long tradition of dominance that presence and ab sence have enjoyed in the Western tradition the surprise is not that forma tions based on them continue to exist but that these formations are being displaced so rapidly across a wide range of cultural sites These examples taken from studies of information technologies illus trate concerns that are also appropriate for literary texts If the effects that the shift toward patternrandomness has on literature are not widely rec ognized perhaps it is because they are at once pervasive and elusive A book produced by typesetting may look very similar to one generated by a computerized program but the technological processes involved in this transformation are not neutral Different technologies of text production suggest different models of signification changes in signification are linked with shifts in consumption shifting patterns of consumption initiate new experiences of embodiment and embodied experience interacts with codes of representation to generate new kinds of textual worlds 11 In fact each categoryproduction signification consumption bodily experi ence and representationis in constant feedback and feedforward loops with the others As the emphasis shifts to pattern and randomness characteristics of print texts that used to be transparent because they were so pervasive are becoming visible again through their differences from digital textuality We lose the opportunity to understand the implications of these shifts if we mistake the dominance of patternrandomness for the disappearance of the material world In fact it is precisely because material interfaces have changed that pattern and randomness can be perceived as dominant over presence and absence The patternrandomness dialectic does not erase the material world information in fact derives its efficacy from the mater ial infrastructures it appears to obscure This illusion of erasure should be the subject of inquiry not a presupposition that inquiry takes for granted To explore the importance of the mediums materiality let us consider the book Like the human body the book is a form ofinformation transmis sion and storage and like the human body the book incorporates its en codings in a durable material substrate Once encoding in the material base Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  has taken place it cannot easily be changed Print and proteins in this sense have more in common with each other than with magnetic encodings which can be erased and rewritten simply by changing the polarities In chapter 8 we shall have an opportunity to see how a books selfrepresenta tions change when the book is linked with magnetic encodings The print ing metaphors pervasive in the discourse of genetics are constituted through and by this similarity of corporeal encoding in books and bodies The entanglement of signal and materiality in bodies and books confers on them a parallel doubleness As we have seen the human body is under stood in molecular biology simultaneously as an expression of genetic in formation and as a physical structure Similarly the literary corpus is at once a physical object and a space of representation a body and a message Because they have bodies books and humans have something to lose if they are regarded solely as informational patterns namely the resistant materi ality that has traditionally marked the durable inscription of books no less than it has marked our experiences ofliving as embodied creatures From this affinity emerge complex feedback loops between contemporary litera ture the technologies that produce it and the embodied readers who pro duce and are produced by books and technologies Changes in bodies as they are represented within literary texts have deep connections with changes in textual bodies as they are encoded within information media and both types of changes stand in complex relation to changes in the construction of human bodies as they interface with information technolo gies The term I use to deSignate this network of relations is informatics Following Donna Haraway I take informatics to mean the technologies of information as well as the biological social linguistic and cultural changes that initiate accompany and complicate their development 12 I am now in a position to state the thesis of this chapter explicitly The contemporary pressure toward dematerialization understood as an epis temic shift toward patternrandomness and away from presenceabsence affects human and textual bodies on two levels at once as a change in the body the material substrate and as a change in the message the codes of representation The connectivity between these changes is as they say in the computer industry maSSively parallel and highly interdigitated My narrative will therefore weave back and forth between the represented worlds of contemporary fictions models of signification implicit in word processing embodied experience as it is constructed by interactions with information technologies and the technologies themselves The compounding of Signal with materiality suggests that new technolo gies will instantiate new models of signification Information technologies do more than change modes of text production storage and dissemination They fundamentally alter the relation of Signified to Signifier Carrying the instabilities implicit in Lacanian floating signifiers one step further infor mation technologies create what I will calljlickering signifiers character ized by their tendency toward unexpected metamorphoses attenuations and dispersions Flickering signifiers signal an important shift in the plate tectonics oflanguage Much of contemporary fiction is directly influenced by information technolOgies cyberpunk for example takes informatics as its central theme Even narratives without this focus can hardly avoid the rippling effects of informatics however for the changing modes of signifi cation affect the codes as well as the subjects of representation Signifying the Processes of Production Language is not a code Lacan asserted because he wanted to deny one toone correspondence between the Signifier and the signified13 In word processing however language is a code The relation between machine and compiler languages is specified by a coding arrangement as is the rela tion of the compiler language to the programming commands that the user manipulates Through these multiple transformations some quantity is conserved but it is not the mechanical energy implicit in a system oflevers or the molecular energy of a thermodynamical system Rather it is the in formational structure that emerges from the interplay between pattern and randomness When a text presents itself as a constantly refreshed im age rather than as a durable inscription transformations can occur that would be unthinkable if matter or energy rather than informational pat terns formed the primary basis for the systemic exchanges This textual flu idity which users learn in their bodies as they interact with the system implies that signifiers flicker rather than float To explain what I mean by flickering signifiers I will briefly review Lacans notion of floating signifiers Lacan operating within a view oflan guage that was primarily printbased rather than electronically mediated not surprisingly focused on presence and absence as the dialectic of inter est14 When he formulated the concept of floating signifiers he drew on Saussures idea that signifiers are defined by networks of relational differ ences between themselves rather than by their relation to signifieds He complicated this picture by maintaining that signifieds do not exist in them selves except insofar as they are produced by signifiers He imagined them as an ungraspable flow floating beneath a network of signifiers a network that itself is constituted through continual slippages and displacements Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  3 Thus for him a doubly reinforced absence is at the core of signification the absence of signifieds as thingsinthemselves as well as the absence of stable correspondences between signifiers The catastrophe in psycholin guistic development corresponding to this absence in signification is cas tration the moment when the male subject symbolically confronts the realization that subjectivity like language is founded on absence How does this scenario change when floating signifiers give way to flick ering signifiers Foregrounding pattern and randomness information technologies operate within a realm in which the signifier is opened to a rich internal play of difference In informatics the signifier can no longer be understood as a single marker for example an ink mark on a page Rather it exists as a flexible chain of markers bound together by the arbitrary rela tions specified by the relevant codes As I write these words on my com puter I see the lights on the video screen but for the computer the relevant signifiers are electronic polarities on disks Intervening between what I see and what the computer reads are the machine code that correlates al phanumeric symbols with binary digits the compiler language that corre lates these symbols with higherlevel instmctions determining how the symbols are to be manipulated the processing program that mediates be tween these instmctions and the commands I give the computer and so forth A signifier on one level becomes a signified on the nexthigher level PreCisely because the relation between signifier and signified at each of these levels is arbitrary it can be changed with a single global command If I am prodUCing ink marks by manipulating movable type changing the font requires changing each line of type By contrast if I am prodUCing flicker ing signifiers on a video screen changing the font is as easy as giving the sys tem a single command The longer the chain of codes the more radical the transformations that can be effected Acting as linguistic transducers the coding chains impart astonishing power to even very small changes Such amplification is possible because the constant reproduced through multi ple coding layers is a pattern rather than a presence Where does randomness enter this picture Within information theory information is identified with choices that reduce uncertainty for example when I choose which book out of eight on a reading list my seminar will read for the first week of class To get this information to the students I need some way to transmit it Information theory treats the communica tion situation as a system in which a sender encodes a message and sends it as a signal through a channel At the other end is a receiver who decodes the Signal and reconstitutes the message Suppose I write my students an email The computer encodes the message in binary digits and sends a sig nal corresponding to these digits to the server which then reconstitutes the message in a form the students can read At many points along this route noise can intervene The message may be garbled by the computer system so that it arrives looking like e 1 s   Or I may have gotten distracted thinking about DeLillo halfWay through the message so that although I meant to assign Calvino for the first week the message comes out If on a winters night a white noise These examples indicate that for reallife communication situations pattern exists in dynamic tension with the ran dom intrusions of noise Uncertainty enters in another sense as well Although information is often defined as reducing uncertainty it also depends on uncertainty Sup pose for example Gravitys Rainbow is the only text on the reading list The probability that I would choose it is 1 If I send an email telling my students that the text for this week is Gravitys Rainbow they willleam nothing they did not already know and no information is communicated The most surprising information I could send them would be a string of random letters Remember that information in the technical sense has nothing to do with meaning the fact that such a message would be mean ingless is thus paradoxically irrelevant to calculating the amount of infor mation it contains These intuitions are confirmed by the mathematical theory of information15 For an individual message the information increases as the probability that the event will occur diminishes the more unlikely the event the more information it conveys Appropriately this quantity is usually called the surprisal Lets say that nine of my reading assignments were on Gravitys Rainbow and one was on Vineland The students would gain more information from a message telling them that the assignment was Vineland than from a message stating that the assignment was Gravitys Rainbowthe more probable event and hence the more ex pected Most of the time however electrical engineers are not interested in individual messages but in all the messages that can be produced from a given source Thus they do not so much want to know the surprisal as the average amount of information coming from a source This average reaches a maximum when it is equally likely that any symbol can appear in any positionwhich is to say when there is no pattern or when the mes sage is at the extreme of randomness Thus Warren Weaver in his interpre tation of Shannons theory of information suggested that information should be understood as depending on both predictability and unpre dictability pattern and randomness16 What happens in the case of mutation Consider the example of the ge netic code Mutation normally occurs when some random event for exam ple a burst of radiation or a coding error disrupts an existing pattern and Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  something else is put in its place instead Although mutation disrupts pat tern it also presupposes a morphological standard against which it can be measured and understood as a mutation If there were only randomness as with the random movements of gas molecules it would make no sense to speak of mutation We have seen that in electronic textuality the possi bilities for mutation within the text are enhanced and heightened by long coding chains We can now understand mutation in more fundamental terms Mutation is crucial because it names the bifurcation point at which the interplay between pattern and randomness causes the system to evolve in a new direction It reveals the productive potential of randomness that is also recognized within information theory when uncertainty is seen as both antagonistic and intrinsic to information We are now in a position to understand mutation as a decisive event in the psycholinguistics of information Mutation is the catastrophe in the patternrandomness dialectic analogous to castration in the presenceab sence dialectic It marks a rupture of pattern so extreme that the expecta tion of continuous replication can no longer be sustained But as with castration this only appears to be a disruption located at a specific moment The randomness to which mutation testifies is implicit in the very idea of pattern for only against the background of nonpattern can pattern emerge Randomness is the contrasting term that allows pattern to be understood as such The crisis named by mutation is as wideranging and pervasive in its import within the patternrandomness dialectic as castration is within the tradition of presenceabsence for it is the visible mark that testifies to the continuing interplay of the dialectic between pattern and randomness replication and variation expectation and surprise Shifting the emphasis from presenceabsence to patternrandomness suggests different choices for tutor texts Rather than studying Freuds dis cussion of fort da a short passage whose replication in hundreds of com mentaries would no doubt astonish its creator theorists interested in pattern and randomness might point to David Cronenbergs film The Fly At a certain point the protagonists penis does falloff quaintly he puts it in his medicine chest as a memento of times past but the loss scarcely regis ters in the larger mutation he is undergoing The operative transition is not from male to femaleascastratedmale but from human to something rad ically other than human Flickering signification brings together language with a psychodynamics based on the symbolic moment when the human confronts the posthuman As I indicated in chapter 1 I understand human and posthuman to be histOrically specific constructions that emerge from different configura tions of embodiment technology and culture My reference point for the human is the tradition ofliberal humanism the posthuman appears when computation rather than possessive individualism is taken as the ground of being a move that allows the posthuman to be seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines To see how technology interacts with these construc tions consider the picture that nineteenthcentury VS and British an thropologists have drawn of man as a tooluser 17 V sing tools may shape the body some anthropolOgists made this argument but the tool never theless is envisioned as an object that is apart from the body an object that can be picked up and put down at will When the claim that mans unique nature was defined by tool use could not be sustained because other ani mals were shown also to use tools the focus shifted during the early twen tieth century to man the toolmaker Typical is Kenneth P Oakleys 1949 Man the ToolMaker a magisterial work with the authOrity of the British Museum behind it Oakley in charge of the Anthropological Section of the museums Natural History Division wrote in his introduction Employ ment of tools appears to be mans chief biological characteristic for con sidered functionally they are detachable extensions of the forelimb 18 The kind of tool he envisioned was mechanical rather than informational it goes with the hand not on the head Significantly he imagined the tool to be at once detachable and an extension separate from yet partaking of the hand If the placement and the kind of tool mark Oakleys affinity with the epoch of the human the construction of the tool as a prosthesis points forward to the posthuman By the 1960s Marshall McLuhan was speculating about the transforma tion that media understood as technological prostheses were effecting on human beings19 He argued that humans react to stress in their envi ronments by withdrawing the locus of selfhood inward in a numbing withdrawal from the world he called follOwing Hans Selye and Adolphe Jonas autoamputation This withdrawal in tum facilitates and requires compensating technological extensions that project the bodyasprosthesis back out into the world Whereas Oakley remains grounded in the human and looks only distantly toward the posthuman McLuhan clearly sees that electronic media are capable of bringing about a reconfiguration so exten sive as to change the nature of man As we saw in chapter 1 similar shifts in orientation informed the Macy Conference discussions taking place during the same period 194653 Participants wavered between a vision of man as a homeostatic self regulating mechanism whose boundaries were clearly delineated from the environment20 and a more threatening reflexive vision of a man spliced into an informational circuit that could change him in unpredictable ways Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier I 35 By the 1960s the consensus within cybernetics had shifted dramatically to ward reflexivity By the 1980s the inertial pull of homeostasis as a constitu tive concept had largely given way to selforganization theories implying that radical changes were possible within certain kinds of complex sys tems21 In the contemporary period the posthuman future of humanity is increaSingly evoked ranging from Hans Moravecs argument for a postbi ological future in which intelligent machines become the dominant life form on the planet to the more sedate and in part already realized prospect of a symbiotic union between human and intelligent machine a union that Howard Rheingold calls intelligence augmentation22 Although these vi sions differ in the degree and kind of interfaces they imagine they concur that the posthuman implies not only a coupling with intelligent machines but a coupling so intense and multifaceted that it is no longer possible to distinguish meaningfully between the biological organism and the infor mational circuits in which the organism is enmeshed Accompanying this change is a corresponding shift in how signification is understood and cor poreally experienced In contrast to Lacanian psycholinguistics derived from the generative coupling oflinguistics and sexuality flickering signifi cation is the progeny of the fascinating and troubling coupling oflanguage and machine Information Narratives and Bodies of Information The shift from presence and absence to pattern and randomness is en coded into every aspect of contemporary literature from the physical ob ject that constitutes the text to such staples of literary interpretation as character plot author and reader The development is by no means even some texts testify dramatically and explicitly to the shift whereas others manifest this shift only indirectly I will call those texts in which the dis placement is most apparent infonnation narratives Information narra tives show in exaggerated form changes that are more subtly present in other texts as well Whether in information narratives or contemporary fic tion generally the dynamiC of displacement is crucial One could focus on pattern in any era but the peculiarity of pattern in these texts is its inter penetration with randomness and its implicit challenge to phYSicality Pattern tends to overwhelm presence leading to a construction of immate riality that depends not on spirituality or even consciousness but only on in formation Consider William Gibsons Neuromancer 1984 the novel thatalong with the companion volumes Count Zero 1986 and Mona Lisa Overdrive 1988sparked the cyberpunk movement The Neuromancer trilogy gave a local habitation and a name to the disparate spaces of computer sim ulations networks and hypertext windows that before Gibsons interven tion had been discussed as separate phenomena Gibsons novels acted like seed crystals thrown into a supersaturated solution the time was ripe for the technology known as cyberspace to precipitate into public conscious ness In Neuromancer the narrator defines cyberspace as a consensual il lusion accessed when a user jacks into a computer Here the writers imagination outstrips existing technologies for Gibson imagines a direct neural link between the brain and the computer through electrodes An other version of this link is a socket implanted behind the ear that accepts computer chips allOwing direct neural access to computer memory Net work users collaborate in creating the richly textured landscape of cyber space a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system Unthinkable complexity Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind clusters and constellations of data Like city lights receding 23 Existing in the nonmaterial space of computer simulation cyberspace defines a regime of representation within which pattern is the essential reality presence an optical illusion Like the landscapes they negotiate the subjectivities who operate within cyberspace also become patterns rather than physical entities Case the computer cowboy who is the protagonist of Neuromancer still has a physical presence although he regards his body as so much meat that ex ists primarily to sustain his consciousness until the next time he can enter cyberspace Others have completed the transition that Cases values imply Dixie Flatline a cowboy who encountered something in cyberspace that flattened his EEG ceased to exist as a physical body and lives now as a per sonality construct within the computer defined by the magnetic patterns that store his identity The contrast between the bodys limitations and cyberspaces power highlights the advantages of pattern over presence As long as the pattern endures one has attained a kind of immortalityan implication that Hans Moravec makes explicit in Mind Children Such views are authorized by cultural conditions that make physicality seem a better state to be from than to inhabit In a world despOiled by overdevelopment overpopulation and timerelease environmental poisons it is comforting to think that phys ical forms can recover their pristine purity by being reconstituted as infor mational patterns in a multidimensional computer space A cyberspace body like a cyberspace landscape is immune to blight and corruption It is no accident that the vaguely apocalyptic landscapes of films such as Ter Virrual Bodies and Flickering Signifier I minator Blade Runner and Hardware occur in narratives focusing on cybernetic lifeforms The sense that the world is rapidly becoming unin habitable by human beings is part of the impetus for the displacement of presence by pattern These connections lie close to the surface in Neuromancer Get just wasted enough find yourself in some desperate but strangely arbitrary kind of trouble and it was possible to see Nlnsei as a field of data the way the matrix had once reminded him of proteins linking to distinguish cell specialities Then you could throw yourself into a highspeed drift and skid totally engaged but set apart from it all and all around you the dance of biz information interacting data made flesh in the mazes of the black mar ket24 The metaphOriC slippages between urban sprawl computer matrix and biolOgical protein culminate in the final elliptical phrase data made flesh Information is the putative origin physicality the derivative mani festation Body parts sold in blackmarket clinics body neurochemistry manipulated by synthetic drugs body of the world overlaid by urban sprawlall testifY to the precariousness of phYSical existence If flesh is data incarnate why not go back to the source and leave the perils of physi cality behind The reasoning presupposes that subjectivity and computer programs have a common arena in which to interact HistOrically that arena was first defined in cybernetiCS by the creation of a conceptual framework that con stitutedhumans animals and machines as informationprocessing devices receiving and transmitting Signals to effect goaldirected behavior25 Gibson matches this technical achievement with two literary innovations that allow subjectivity with its connotations of consciousness and self awareness to be articulated together with abstract data The first is a subtle modification in point of view abbreviated in the text as pov More than an acronym pov is a substantive noun that constitutes the characters subjec tivity by serving as a positional marker substituting for his absent body In its usual Jamesian sense point of view presumes the fiction of a per son who observes the action from a particular angle and tells what he sees In the preface to The Portrait of a Lady James imagines a house of fiction with a million windows formed by the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual will At each window stands a figure with a pair of eyes or at least with a field glass which forms again and again for observation a unique instrument insuring to the person making use ofit an impression distinct from every other26 For James the observer is an em bodied creature and the specificity of his or her location determines what the observer can see when looking out on a scene that itself is phYSically 38  Chapter Two specific When an omniscient viewpoint is used the limitations of the nar rators corporeality begin to fall away but the suggestion of embodiment lingers in the idea of focus the scene created by the eyes movement Even for James vision is not unmediated technologically Significantly he hovers between eye and field glass as the receptor constituting vision Cyberspace represents a quantum leap fOIWard into the technological con struction of vision Instead of an embodied consciousness looking through the window at a scene consciousness moves through the screen to become the pov leaving behind the body as an unoccupied shell In cyberspace point of view does not emanate from the character rather the pov literally is the character If a pov is annihilated the character disappears with it ceasing to exist as a consciousness in and out of cyberspace The realistic fic tion of a narrator who observes but does not create is thus unmasked in cy berspace The effect is not primarily metafictional however but is in a literal sense metaphysical above and beyond phYSicality The crucial dif ference between the Jamesian point of view and the cyberspace pov is that the former implies phYSical presence whereas the latter does not Gibsons technique recalls Alain RobbeGrillets novels which were among the first information narratives to exploit the formal consequences of combining subjectivity with data In RobbeGrillets work however the effect of interfacing narrative voice with objective description was para dOxically to heighten the narrators subjectivity for certain objects like the jalousied windows or the centipede in Jealousy are inventoried with obses sive interest indicating a mindset that is anything but objective In Gibson the space in which subjectivity moves lacks this personalized stamp Cy berspace is the domain of virtual collectivity constituted as the resultant of millions of vectors representing the diverse and often conflicting interests of human and artificial intelligences linked together through computer networks27 To make this space work as a level playing field on which humans and computers can meet on equal terms Gibson introduces his second innova tion Cyberspace is created by transforming a data matrix into a landscape in which narratives can happen In mathematics matrix is a technical term denoting data that have been arranged into an ndimensional array Expressed in this form data seem as far removed from the fascinations of story as randomnumber tables are from the National Inquirer Because the array is already conceptualized in spatial terms however it is a small step to imagining the matrix as a threedimensional landscape Narrative becomes possible when this spatiality is given a temporal dimension by the povs movement through it The pov is located in space but it exists in time Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  Through the track it weaves the desires repressions and obsessions of subjectivity can be expressed The genius of Neuromancer lies in its explicit recognition that the categories Kant considered fundamental to human ex periencespace and timecan be used as a conjunction to join aware ness with data Reduced to a point the pov is abstracted into a purely temporal entity with no spatial extension metaphorized into an interactive space the datascape is narrativized by the povs movement through it Data are thus humanized and subjectivity is computerized allowing them to join in a symbiotic union whose result is narrative Such innovations carry the implications of informatics beyond the tex tual surface into the signifing processes that constitute theme and charac ter I suspect that Gibsons novels have been so influential not only because they present a vision of the posthuman future that is already upon usin this they are no more prescient than many other science fiction novels but also because they embody within their techniques the assumptions ex pressed explicitly in the themes of the novels This kind of move is possible when the cultural conditions authorizing the assumptions are pervasive enough that the posthuman is experienced as an everyday lived reality as well as an intellectual proposition The shift of emphasis from ownership to access is another manifestation of the underlying transition from presenceabsence to patternlrandom ness In The Condition ofPostrrwdernity David Harvey characterizes the economic aspects of the shift to an informatted society as a transition from a Fordist regime to a regime of flexible accumulation28 As Harvey and many others have pointed out in late capitalism durable goods yield pride of place to information29 A Significant difference between information and durable goods is replicability Information is not a conserved quantity If I give you information you have it and I do too With information the constraining factor separating the haves from the havenots is not so much possession as access Presence precedes and makes possible the idea of possession for one can possess something only if it already exists By con trast access implies pattern recognition whether the access is to a piece of land recognized as such through the boundary pattern defining that land as different from adjoining parcels confidential information constituted as confidential through the comparison of its informational patterns with lesssecure documents or a bank vault associated with knOwing the cor rectpattern of tumbler combinations In general access differs from pos session because the former tracks patterns rather than presences When someone breaks into a computer system it is not a physical presence that is detected but the informational traces that the entry has created30 40  Chapter Two When the emphasis falls on access rather than ownership the private public distinction that was so important in the formation of the novel is rad ically reconfigured Whereas possession implies the existence of private life based on physical exclusion or inclusion access implies the existence of credentialing practices that use patterns rather than presences to distin guish between those who do and those who do not have the right to enter Moreover entering is itself constituted as access to data rather than as a change in physical location In Don DeLillos White Noise 1985 for ex ample the Gladneys home traditionally the private space of family life is penetrated by noise and radiation of all wavelengthsmicrowave radio television31 The penetration signals that private spaces and the private thoughts they engender and figure are less a concern than the interplay be tween codes and the articulation of individual subjectivity with data Jack Gladneys death is prefigured for him as a pattern of pulsing stars around a computerized data display a striking image of how his corporeality has been penetrated by informational patterns that construct as well as predict his mortality Although the Gladney family still operates as a social unit albeit with the geographical dispersion endemic to postmodern life their conversations are punctuated by random bits of information emanating from the radio and Tv The punctuation points toward a mutation in subjectivity that comes from joining the focused attention of traditional novelistic con sciousness with the digitized randomness of miscellaneous bits The muta tion reaches incarnation in Willie Mink whose brain has become so addled by a deSigner drug that his consciousness is finally indistinguishable from the white noise that surrounds him Through a route different from that used by Gibson DeLillo arrives at a similar destination a vision of subjec tivity constituted through the interplay of pattern and randomness rather than presence and absence The bodies of texts are also implicated in these changes The displace ment of presence by pattern thins the tissue of textuality making it a semi permeable membrane that allows awareness of the text as an informational pattern to infuse into the space of representation When the fiction of pres ence gives way to the recognition of pattern passages are opened between the text asobject and those representations within the text that are charac teristic of the condition of virtuality Consider the play between text as physical object and as information How in Italo Calvinos If on a winters night a traveler 1979 The texts awareness of its own phYSicality is painfully apparent in the anxiety it manifests toward keeping the literary corpus intact Within the space of representation texts are subjected to Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  birth defects maimed and tom apart lost and stolen The text operates as if it knows it has a physical body and fears that its body is in jeopardy from a host of threats  from defective printing technologies and editors experienc ing middleage brain fade to nefarious political plots Most of all perhaps the text fears losing its body to information When you the reader are foiled in your pursuit of its story by the frailty of the texts physical corpus the narrator imagines you hurling the book through a closed window reducing the texts body to photons undu latory vibrations polarized spectra Not content with this pulverization you throw itthrough the wall so thatthe text breaks up into electrons neu trons neutrinos elementary particles more and more minute Still disgusted in an act of ultimate dispersion you send it through a computer line causing the textual body to be reduced to electronic impulses into the flow of information With the text shaken by redundancies and noises you let it be degraded into a Swirling entropy Yet the very story you seek can be envisioned as a pattern for that night you sleep and fight with dreams as with formless and meaningless life seeking a pattern a route that must surely be there as when you begin to read a book and you dont yet know in which direction it will carry you32 Once the texts phYSical body is interfaced with information technolo gies however the pattern that is story stands in jeopardy of being disrupted by the randomness implicit in information The disruptive power of ran domness becomes manifest when you find yourself entangled with Lotaria a reader who believes books are best read by scanning them into computers and letting the machine analyze wordfrequency patterns Seduced by Lotaria against your better judgment you get tangled up with her and with rolls of printout covering the floor The printouts contain part of the story that you desperately want to finish which Lotaria has entered into the com puter Distracted by her multiple entanglements Lotaria presses the wrong key and the rest of the story is erased in an instant demagnetization of the circuits The multicolored wires now grind out the dust of dissolved words the the of of of of from from from from that that that that in columns according to their respective frequency The book has been crum bled dissolved can no longer be recomposed like a sand dune blown away by the wind33 Now you can never achieve satiation never reach the point of satisfied completion that comes with finishing a book Your anxiety about reading interruptus is intensified by what might be called print interrup tus a print books fear that once it has been digitized the computer will gar ble its body breaking it apart and reassembling it into the nonstory of a data matrix rather than an entangled and entangling narrative This anxiety is transmitted to readers within the text who keep pursuing parts of textual bodies only to lose them as well as to readers outside the text who must try to make sense of the radically discontinuous narrative Only when the chapter titles are perceived to form a sentence is the literary corpus reconstituted as a unity Significantly the recuperation is syntactical rather than physical It does not arise from or imply an intact physical body Rather it emerges from the patternsmetaphorical grammatical narra tive thematic and textualthat the parts together make As the climactic scene in the library suggests the reconstituted corpus is a body of informa tion emerging from the discourse community among whom information circulates The textual body may be dismembered or ground into digital word dust the narrative implies but as long as there are readers who care passionately about stories and want to pursue them narrative itself can be recuperated Through such textual strategies If on a winters night testifies vividly to the impact of information technologies on bodies of books Human bodies are Similarly affected The correspondence between hu man and textual bodies can be seen as early as William Burroughss Naked Lunch written in 1959 in the decade that saw the institutionalization of cy bernetics and the construction of the first largescale electronic digital computer34 The narrative metamorphizes nearly as often as bodies within it suggesting by its cut up method a textual corpus that is as artificial het erogeneous and cybernetic as they are35 Since the fissures that mark the text always fall within the units that compose the textual bodywithin chapters paragraphs sentences and even wordsit becomes increas ingly clear that they do not function to delineate the textual corpus Rather the body of the textis produced precisely by these fissures which are not so much ruptures as productive dialectics that bring the narrative as a syntac tic and chronological sequence into being Bodies within the text follow the same logic Under the pressure of sex and addiction bodies explode or mutate protoplasm is sucked out of cocks or nostrils plots are hatched to take over the planet or nearest lifeform Burroughs anticipates Fredric Jamesons claim that an information society is the purest form of capitalism When bodies are constituted as informa tion they can be not only sold but fundamentally reconstituted in response to market pressures Junk instantiates the dynamiCS of informatics and makes clear the relation of junkasinformation to late capitalism Junk is the ideal product because the junk merchant does not sell his product to the consumer he sells the consumer to his product He does not improve and simplifY his merchandise He degrades and simplifies the client36 The junkieS body is a harbinger of the postmodern mutant for it demon Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier I by the flow of junkasinformation through points of amplification and re sistance The characteristics of information narratives include then an emphasis on mutation and transformation as a central thematic for bodies within the text as well as for the bodies of texts Subjectivity already joined with infor mation technologies through cybernetic circuits is further integrated into the circuit by novelistic techniques that combine it with data Access vies with possession as a structuring element and data are narrativized to ac commodate their integration with subjectivity In general materiality and immateriality are joined in a complex tension that is a source of exultation and strong anxiety Information technologies leave their mark on books in the realization that sooner or later the body of print will be interfaced with other media All but a handful of books printed in the United States and Europe in 1998 will be digitized during some phase of their existence Print texts such as If on a winters night a traveler bear the imprint of this digitalization in their narratives as if the text remembers the moment when it was nothing but electronic polarities on a disk At moments of crisis the repressed memory erupts onto the textual surface in the form of an acute fear that randomness will so interpenetrate its patterns that story will be lost and the textual cor pus will be reduced to a body of meaningless data These eruptions are vivid testimony that even print texts cannot escape being affected by informa tion technologies To understand more about the effects of informatics on contemporary fictions let us tum now to consider the relation between text and subjectiV ity specifically how information narratives constitute both the voice speak ing the narrative and the reader Functionalities of Narrative The very word narrator implies a voice speaking and a speaking voice im plies a sense of presence Jacques Derrida announcing the advent of gram matology focused on the gap that separates speaking from writing Such a change transforms the narrator from speaker to scribe or more precisely someone who is absent from the scene but toward whom the inscriptions point37 Informatics pushes this transformation further As writing yields to flickering signifiers underwritten by binary digits the narrator becomes not so such a scribe as a cyborg authorized to access the relevant codes The progression suggests that the dialectic between absence and presence came clearly into focus with the advent of deconstruction because it was al ready being displaced as a cultural presupposition by randomness and pat tern Presence and absence were forced into visibility so to speak because they were already losing their constitutive power to form the ground for discourse becoming instead the subject of discourse In this sense decon struction is the child of an information age formulating its theories from strata pushed upward by the emerging substrata beneath To see how the function of the narrator changes as we progress deeper into virtuality consider the seduction scene from I Was an Infinitely Hot and Dense White Dot one of the stories in Mark Leyners My Cousin My Gastroenterologist The narrator high on Sinutab and driving isotropi cally so that any destination is equally probable finds himself at a squalid little dive I dont know  but there she is I canttell if shes a human or a fifthgeneration gynemOIphic android and I dont care I crack open an ampoule of mating pheromone and let it waft across the bar as I sip my drink a methyl isocyanate on the rocksmethyl isocyanate is the substance which killed more than 2 000 people when it leaked in Bhopal India but thanks to my weight training aero bic workouts and a lowfat fiberrich diet the stuff has no effect on me Sure enough she strolls over and occupies the stool next to mine  My lips are now one angstrom unit from her lips  I begin to kiss her but she turns her head away  I cant kiss you were monozygotic replicantswe share 100 of our genetic material My head spins You are the beautiful day I exclaim your breath is a zephyr of eucalyptus that does a pas de bourre across the Sea of Galilee Thanks she says but we cant go back to my house and make love be cause monozygotic incest is forbidden by the elders What if I said I could change all that  What if I said that I had a miniature shotgun that blasts gene fragments into the cells of living organisms altering their genetic matrices so that a monozygotic replicant would no longer be a monozygotic replicant and she could then make love to a muscleman without transgressing the incest taboo I say opening my shirt and exposing the device which I had stuck in the waistband of my black jeans Howd you get that thing she gasps ogling its thick fiberreinforced plastiC barrel and the UziBiotech logo embossed on the mag azine which held two cartridges of gelated recombinant DNA I got it for Christ mas  Do you have any last words before I scramble your chromosomes I say taking aim Yes she says you first38 Much of the wit in this passage comes from the juxtaposition of folk wisdom and seduction cliches with hightech language and ideas The narrator sips a chemical that killed thousands when it leaked into the environment but Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  he is immune to damage because he eats a lowfat diet The narrator leans close to the womanandroid to kiss her but he has not yet made contact when he is an angstrom away considerably less than the diameter of a hy drogen atom The characters cannot make love because they are barred by incest taboos being replicants from the same monozygote which would make them identical twins but this does not seem to prevent them from be ing opposite sexes They are governed by kinship rules enforced by tribal elders but they have access to genetic technologies that intervene in and disrupt evolutionary modes of descent They think their problem can be solved by an UziBiotech weapon that will scramble their chromosomes but the narrator at least seems to expect their identities to survive intact Even within the confines of a short story no more than five pages long this encounter is not preceded or followed by events that relate directly to it Rather the narrative leaps from scene to scene all of them linked by only the most tenuous and arbitrary threads The incongruities make the narra tive a kind of textual android created through patterns of assembly and dis assembly There is no natural body to this text any more than there are natural bodies within the text As the title intimates identity merges with typography I was a  dot and is further conflated with such hightech reconstructions as computer simulations of gravitational collapse I was an infinitely hot and dense white dot Signifiers collapse like stellar bod ies into an explosive materiality that approaches the critical point of nova ready to blast outward into dissipating waves of flickering signification The explosive tensions between cultural codes that familiarize the ac tion and neologistic splices that dislocate traditional expectations do more than structure the narrative They also constitute the narrator who exists less as a speaking voice endowed with a plausible psychology than as a series of fissures and dislocations that push toward a new kind of subjectivity To understand the nature of this subjectivity let us imagine a trajectory that arcs from storyteller to professional to some destination beyond Walter Benjamins shared community of values and presencethe community that he had in mind when he evoked the traditional storyteller whose words are woven into the rhythms of workechoes faintly in allusions to the Song of Songs and tribal elders39 Overlaid on this is the professionalization that JeanFranois Lyotard wrote about in The Postrrwdem Condition in which the authOrity to tell the story is constituted by possessing the appropriate credentials that qualify one as a member of a physically dispersed elec tronically bound professional community4o This phase of the trajectory is Signified in a number of ways The narrator is driving isotropically in dicating that physical location is no longer necessary or relevant to the 46  Chapter Two production of the story His authority derives not from his physical partici pation in a community but from his possession of a hightech language that includes pheromones methyl isocyanate and gelated recombinant DNA not to mention the UziBiotech phallus This authority too is displaced even as it is created for the incongruities reveal that the narrative and therefore the narrator are radically unstable about to mutate into a scarcely conceivable form signified in the story by the hightech identity transforming orgasmic blast that never quite comes What is this form Its physical manifestations vary but the ability to ma nipulate complex codes is a constant The looming transformation already enacted through the language of the passage is into a subjectivity who de rives his authority from possessing the correct codes Popular literature and culture contain countless scenarios in which someone fools a computer into thinking that he or she is an authorized person because the person possesses or stumbles upon the codes that the computer recognizes as con stituting authorization Usually these scenarios imply that the person exists unchanged taking on a spurious identity that allows him or her to move un recognized within an informational system There is however another way to read these narratives Constituting identity through authorization codes the person using the codes is changed into another kind of subjectivity pre cisely one who exists and is recognized because oflmowing the codes The surface deception is underlaid by a deeper truth We become the codes we punch The narrator is not a storyteller and not a professional authority al though these functions lingerin the narrative as anachronistic allusions and wrenched referentiality Rather the narrator is a keyboarder a hacker a manipulator of codes 41 Assuming that the text was digitized at some phase in its existence in a literal sense he it is these codes The construction of the narrator as a manipulator of codes obviously has important implications for the construction of the reader The reader is similarly constituted through a layered archaeology that moves from lis tener to reader to decoder Drawing on a context that included information technologies Roland Barthes in SZ brilliantly demonstrated the possibil ity of reading a text as a production of diverse codes42 Information narra tives make that possibility an inevitability for they often cannot be understood even on a literal level without referring to codes and the infor matics that produce and are produced by these codes Flickering Significa tion extends the productive force of codes beyond the text to include the signifying processes by which the technologies produce texts as well as the interfaces that enmesh humans into integrated circuits As the circuits connecting technology text and human expand and intensifY the point Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  17 where quantitative increments shade into qualitative transformation draws closer Because codes can be sent over fiber optics essentially instantaneously there is no longer a shared stable context that helps to anchor meaning and guide interpretation Like reading decoding takes place in a location arbi trarilyfar removed in space and time from the source text In contrast to the fixity of print decoding implies that there is no original textno first edi tions no fair copies no holographic manuscripts There are only the flick ering signifiers whose transient patterns evoke and embody what c W S Trow has called the context of no context the suspicion that all contexts like all texts are electronically mediated constructions43 What binds the decoder to the system is not the stability of being a member of an interpre tive community or the intense pleasure of physically possessing the book a pleasure that all bibliophiles know Rather it is the decoders construction as a cyborg the impression that his or her physicality is also data made flesh another flickering signifier in a chain of signification that extends through many levels from the DNA that in formats the decoders body to the binary code that is the computers first language Against this dream or nightmare of the body as information what alter natives exist We can see beyond this dream I have argued by attending to the material interfaces and technologies that make disembodiment such a powerful illusion By adopting a double vision that looks simultaneously at the power of simulation and at the materialities that produce it we can bet ter understand the implications of articulating posthuman constructions together with embodied actualities One way to think about these material ities is through functionality Functionality is a term used by virtual real ity technologists to describe the communication modes that are active in a computerhuman interface If the user wears a data glove for example hand motions constitute one functionality If the computer can respond to voiceactivated commands voice is another functionality If the computer can sense body position spatial location is yet another functionality Func tionalities work in both directions that is they describe the computers ca pabilities and also indicate how the users sensorymotor apparatus is being trained to accommodate the computers responses Working with a VR sim ulation the user learns to move his or her hand in stylized gestures that the computer can accommodate In the process the neural configuration of the users brain experiences changes some of which can be longlasting The computer molds the human even as the human builds the computer When narrative functionalities change a new kind of reader is produced by the text The material effects of flickering signification ripple outward 48  Chapter Two because readers are trained to read through different functionalities which can affect how they interpret any text including texts written before computers were invented The impatience that some readers now feel with print texts for example no doubt has a physiological as well as a psycholog ical basis They miss pushing the keys and seeing the cursor blinking at them Conversely other readers or perhaps the same readers in different moods go back to print with a renewed appreciation for its durability its sturdiness and its ease of use I began to appreciate certain qualities of print only after I had experience with computers When I open a book it almost always works and it can maintain backward compatibility for hun dreds of years I also appreciate that on some occasionswhen I am revis ing a piece of writing for examplethere isnt a cursor blinking at me as if demanding a response With print I can take as long as I want and the pages never disappear or shut themselves down As these examples illustrate changes in narrative functionalities are deeper than the structural or the matic characteristics of a specific genre for they shift the embodied re sponses and expectations that different kinds of textualities evoke Arguing from a different historical context Friedrich Kittler made a similar point when he wrote about medial ecology44 When new media are introduced the changes transform the environment as a whole This transformation affects the niches that older media have carved for themselves so they change also even if they are not directly involved with the new media Books will not remain unaffected by the emergence of new media If my assessmentthat the emphasis on information technologies fore grounds patternrandomness and pushes presenceabsence into the back groundis correct the implications extend beyond narrative into many cultural arenas As I indicated in chapter 1 one of the most serious of these implications is a systematic devaluation of materiality and embodiment I find this trend ironic for changes in material conditions and embodied ex perience are precisely what give the shift its deep roots in everyday experi ence Implicit in nearly everything I have written here is the assumption that presence and pattern are opposites existing in antagonistic relation The more emphasis that falls on one the less the other is noticed and val ued Entirely different readings emerge when one entertains the possibil ity that pattern and presence are mutually enhanCing and supportive Paul Virilio has observed that one cannot ask whether information technolOgies should continue to be developed45 Given market forces already at work it is virtually if I may use the word certain that we will increasingly live work and play in environments that construct us as embodied virtuali ties46 I believe that our best hope to intervene constructively in this de Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  velopment is to put an interpretive spin on it one that opens up the possi bilities of seeing pattern and presence as complementary rather than an tagonistic Information like humanity cannot exist apart from the embodiment that brings it into being as a material entity in the world and embodiment is always instantiated local and specific Embodiment can be destroyed but it cannot be replicated Once the specific form constituting it is gone no amount of massaging data will bling it back This observation is as true of the planet as itis of an individuallifeform As we rush to explore the new vistas that cyberspace has made available for colonization let us re member the fragility of a material world that cannot be replaced  Cha  pLer  Thre  e CONTESTING FOR THE BODY OF INFORMATION THE MACY CONFERENCES ON CYBERNETICS When and where did information get constructed as a disembodied medium How were researchers convinced that humans and machines are brothers under the skin Although the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics were notthe only forum grappling with these questions they were particu larly important because they acted as a crossroads for the traffic in cyber netic models and artifacts This chapter charts the arguments that made information seem more important than materiality within this research community Broadly speaking the arguments were deployed along three fronts The first was concerned with the construction of information as a theoretical entity the second with the construction of human neural structures so that they were seen as flows of information the third with the construction of artifacts that translated information flows into observable operations thereby making the flows real Yet at each of these fronts there was also significant resistance to the reification of information Alternate models were proposed important qualifications were voiced objections were raised to the disparity between simple artifacts and the complex problems they addressed Reification was triumphant not because it had no opposition but because scientifically and culturally situated debates made it seem a better choice than the alterna tives Recovering the complexities of these debates helps to demystifY the assumption that information is more essential than matter or energy Fol lowed backto moments before it became a black box this conclusion seems less like an inevitability and more like the result of negotiations specific to the circumstances of the US technoscientific culture during and imme diately follOwing World War II The Macy Conferences were unusual in that participants did not pre sent finished papers Rather speakers were invited to sketch out a few Contesting for the Body of Information  main ideas to initiate discussion The discussions rather than the presen tations were the center of interest Designed to be intellectual freefor alls the conferences were radically interdisciplinary The transcripts show that researchers from a wide variety of fieldsneurophysiology electrical engineering philosophy semantics literature and psychology among othersstruggled to understand one another and make connec tions between others ideas and their own areas of expertise In the process a concept that may have begun as a model of a particular physical system came to have broader significance acting Simultaneously as mechanism and metaphor The dynamics of the conferences facilitated this mixing Researchers might not have been able to identify in their own work the mechanism dis cussed by a fellow participant but they could understand it metaphorically and then associate the metaphor with something applicable to their own field The process appears repeatedly throughout the transcripts When Claude Shannon used the word information for example he employed it as a technical term having to do with message probabilities When Gregory Bateson appropriated the same word to talk about initiation rituals he in terpreted it metaphorically as a difference that makes a difference and associated it with feedback loops between contesting social groups As mechanism and metaphor were compounded concepts that began with narrow definitions spread out into networks of broader Significance Ear lier I called these networks constellations suggesting that during the Macy period the emphaSiS was on homeostasis This chapter explores the elements that came together to form the homeostasis constellation it also demonstrates the chain of associations that bound refleXivity together with subjectivity during the Macy period which fix many of the phYSical scien tists was enough to relegate reflexivity to the category of nonscience rather than science Tracing the development of reflexive epistemologies after the Macy period ended the chapter concludes by showing how re flexivitywas modified so that it could count as prodUCing scientific knowl edge during the second wave of cybernetics The Meaninglessness of Information The triumph of information over materiality was a major theme at the first Macy Conference John von Neumann and Norbert Wiener led the way by making clear that the important entity in the manmachine equation was information not energy Although energy considerations are not entirely absent von Neumann discussed at length the problems involved in dissi pating the heat generated from vacuum tubes the thermodynamics of heat was incidental Central was how much information could flow through the system and how quickly it could move Wiener emphasizing the move ment from energy to information made the point explicitly The funda mental idea is the message    and the fundamental element of the message is the decisionl Decisions are important not because they pro duce material goods but because they produce information Control infor mation and power follows But what counts as information We sawin chapter 1 that Claude Shan non defined information as a probability function with no dimensions no materiality and no necessary connection with meaning Although a full exposition of information theory is beyond the scope of this book the fol lowing explanation adapted from an account by Wiener will give an idea of the underlying reasoning 2 Like Shannon Wiener thought of informa tion as representing a choice More specifically it represents a choice of one message from among a range of possible messages Suppose there are thirtytwo horses in a race and we want to bet on Number 3 The bookie suspects the police have tapped his telephone so he has arranged for his clients to use a code He studied communication theory perhaps he was in one of the summerschool classes on communication theory that Wiener taught at UCLA and he knows that any message can be communicated through a binary code When we call up his voice program asks if the number falls in the range ofl to 16 fit does we punch the number 1 if not the number 0 We use this same code when the voice program asks if the number falls in the range of 1 to 8 then the range of 1 to 4 and next the range of 1 to 2 Now the program knows that the number must be ei ther 3 or 4 so it says lf3 press 1 if 4 press 0 and a final tap communi cates the number Using these binary divisions we need five responses to communicate our choice How does this simple decision process translate into information First let us generalize our result Probability theory states that the number ofbi nary choices C necessary to uniquely identify an element from a set with n elements can be calculated as follows c  log2n In our case C  log232  5 the five choices we made to convey our desired selection Hereafter to simplify the notation consider all logarithms taken to base 2 Working Contesting for the Body of Information  from this formula Wiener defined information I as the log of the number n of elements in the message set  logn This fonnula gives  when the elements are equally likely Usually this is not the case in English for example the letter e is far more likely to occur than z For the more general situation when the elementss l S2 S3  sn are not equally likely and ps is the probability that the element s will be chosen s  log IIpsi  logpsJ This is the general formula for information communicated by a specific event in our case the call to the bookie Because electrical engineers must design circuits to handle a variety of messages they are less interested in specific events than they are in the average amount of information from a source for example the average of all the different messages that a client might communicate about the horse race This more complex case is rep resented by the following formula  ps logpsJ where ps is the probability that the message element Si will be selected from a message set with n elements indicates the sum of terms as i varies from 1 ton3 We are now in a position to understand the deeper implications ofinfor mation as it was theorized by Wiener and Shannon Note that the theory is formulated entirely without reference to what information means Only the probabilities of message elements enter into the equations Why di vorce information from meaning Shannon and Wiener wanted informa tion to have a stable value as it moved from one context to another If it was tied to meaning it would potentially have to change values every time it was embedded in a new context because context affects meaning Suppose for example you are in a windowless office and call to ask about the weather Its raining I say On the other hand if we are both standing on a street comer being drenched by a downpour this same response would have a very different meaning In the first case I am telling you something you dont know in the second I am being ironic or perhaps moronic An in formation concept that ties information to meaning would have to yield two different values for the two circumstances even though the message Its raining is the same To cut through this Gordian knot Shannon and Wiener defined infor mation so that it would be calculated as the same value regardless of the 54  Chapter Three contexts in which it was embedded which is to say they divorced it from meaning In context this was an appropriate and sensible decision Taken out of context the definition allowed information to be conceptualized as if it were an entity that can How unchanged between different material sub strates as when Moravec envisions the information contained in a brain being downloaded into a computer Ironically this reification of informa tion is enacted through the same kind of decontextualizing moves that the theory uses to define information as such The theory decontextualizes in formation Moravec decontextualizes the theory Thus a Simplification ne cessitated by engineering considerations becomes an ideology in which a reified concept of information is treated as if it were fully commensurate with the complexities of human thought4 Shannon himself was meticulously careful about how he applied infor mation theory repeatedly stressing that information theory concerned only the efficient transmission of messages through communication chan nels not what those messages mean Although others were quick to impute larger linguistic and social implications to the theory he resisted these at tempts Responding to a presentation by Alex Bavelas on group communi cation at the eighth Macy Conference he cautioned that he did not see too close a connection between the notion of information as we use it in com munication engineering and what you are doing here  the problem here is not so much finding the best encoding of symbols  but rather the de termination of the semantic question of what to send and to whom to send it5 For Shannon defining information as a probability function was a strategic choice that enabled him to bracket semantics He did not want to get involved in having to consider the receivers mindset as part of the com munication system He felt so strongly on this point that he suggested Bavelas distinguish between information in a channel and information in a human mind by characterizing the latter through subjective probabili ties although how these were to be defined and calculated was by no means clear Not everyone agreed that it was a good idea to decontextualize informa tion At the same time that Shannon and Wiener were forging what in formation would mean in a US context Donald MacKay a British researcher was trying to formulate an information theory that would take meaning into account At the seventh conference he presented his ideas to the Macy group The difference between his view and Shannons can be seen in the way he bridled at Shannons suggestion about subjective prob abilities In the rhetoric of the Macy Conferences objective was associ ated with being scientific whereas subjective was a code word implying Contesting for the Body of Information I magnificent but were certainly not science MacKays first move was to res cue information that affected the receivers mindset from the subjective label He proposed that both Shannon and Bavelas were concerned with what he called selective information that is information calculated by considering the selection of message elements from a set But selective in formation alone is not euough also required is another kind of information that he called structural Structural information indicates how selective information is to be understood it is a message about how to interpret a messagethat is it is a metacommunication To illustrate say I launch into a joke and it falls Bat In that case I may re sort to telling my interlocutor Thats a joke The information content of this message considered as selective information measured in metrons is calculated with probability functions similar to those used in the Shannon Wiener theory In addition my metacomment also carries structural infor mation measured in logons for it indicates that the preceding message has one kind of structure rather than another a joke instead of a serious statement In another image MacKay liked to use he envisioned selective information as choosing among folders in a file drawer whereas structural information increased the number of drawers jokes in one drawer aca demic treatises in another Since structural information indicates how a message should be inter preted semantics necessarily enters the picture In sharp contrast to mes sage probabilities which have no connection with meaning structural information was to be calculated through changes brought about in the re ceivers mind Its raining heard by someone in a windowless office would yield a value for the structural information different from the value that it would yield when heard by someone looking out a window at rain To em phaSize the correlation between structural information and changes in the receivers mind MacKay offered an analogy It is as if we had discovered how to talk quantitatively about size through discovering its effects on the measuring apparatus6 The analogy implies that representations created by the mind have a double valence Seen from one perspective they contain information about the world Its raining From another perspective they are interactive phenomena that point back to the observer for this informa tion is quantified by measuring changes in the measuring instrument that is in the mind itself And how does one measure these changes An observer looks at the mind of the person who received the message which is to say that changes are made in the observers mind which in tum can also be ob served and measured by someone else The progression tends toward the infinite regress characteristic of reflexivity Arguing for a strong correlation between the nature of a representation and its effect MacKays model rec ognized the mutual constitution of form and content message and receiver His model was fundamentally different from the ShannonWiener theory because it triangulated between reflexivity information and meaning In the context of the Macy Conferences his conclusion qualified as radical subjectivity far from being a morass to be avoided is precisely what enables information and meaning to be connected The problem was how to quantifY the model To achieve quantification a mathematical model was needed for the changes that a message triggered in the receivers mind The staggering problems this presented no doubt explain why MacKays version of information theory was not widely ac cepted among the electrical engineers who would be writing reading and teaching the textbooks on information theory in the coming decades Al though MacKays work continued to be foundational for the British school of information theory in the V nited States the ShannonWiener definition of information not MacKays became the industry standard Not everyone in the V nited States capitulated As late as 1968 Nicolas S Tzannes an information theorist working for the VS government sent Warren McCulloch a memorandum about his attempt to revise MacKays theory so that it would be more workable He wanted to define informa tion so that its meaning varied with context and he looked to Kotellys con text algebra for a way to handle these changes quantitatively In the process he made an important observation He pOinted out that whereas Shannon and Wiener define information in terms of what it is MacKay defines it in terms of what it does 8 The formulation emphasizes the reification that in formation undergoes in the ShannonWiener theory Stripped of context it becomes a mathematical quantity weightless as sunshine moving in a rarefied realm of pure probability not tied down to bodies or material in stantiations The price it pays for this universality is its divorce from repre sentation When information is made representational as in MacKays model it is conceptualized as an action rather than a thing Verblike it be comes a process that someone enacts and thus it necessarily implies con text and embodiment The price it pays for embodiment is difficulty of quantification and loss of universality In the choice between what information is and what it does we can see the rival constellations of homeostasis and reflexivity beginning to take shape Making information a thing allies it with homeostasis for so defined it can be transported into any medium and maintain a stable quantitative value reinforcing the stability that homeostasis implies Making informa Contesting for the Body of Information  tion an action links it with reflexivity for then its effect on the receiver must be taken into account and measuring this effect sets up the potential for a reflexive spiral through an infinite regress of observers Homeostasis won in the first wave largely because it was more manageable quantitatively Re flexivity lost because specifYing and delimiting context quickly ballooned into an unmanageable project At every point these outcomes are tied to the historical contingencies of the situationthe definitions offered the models proposed the techniques available the allies and resources mobi lized by contending participants for their views Conceptualizing informa tion as a disembodied entity was not an arbitrary decision but neither was it inevitable The tension between reified models and embodied complexities figures importantly in the next episode of our story If humans are information processing machines then they must have biological equipment enabling them to process binary code The model constructing the human in these terms was the McCullochPitts neuron The McCullochPitts neuron was the primary model through which cybernetics was seen as having a setting in the flesh as Warren McCulloch put it The problem was how to move from this strippeddown neural model to such complex issues as universals in thought gestalts in perception and representations of what a system cannot represent Here the slippage between mechanism and model be comes important for even among researchers dedicated to a hardscience approach such as McCulloch the tendency was to use the model meta phOrically to forge connections between relatively simple neural circuits and the complexities of embodied experience In the process the disem bodied logical form of the circuit was rhetorically transformed from being an effect of the model to a cause of the models efficacy This move familiar to us as the Platonic backhand made embodied reality into a blurred and messy instantiation of the clean abstractions oflogical forms Unlike others who make this move however McCulloch never relinquished his commit ment to embodiment The tension between logical form and embodiment in his work displays how the construction of a weightless information was complicated when cybernetics moved into the intimate context of the bodys own neural functioning Neural Nets as Logical Operators Warren McCulloch figured large in the Macy Conferences He chaired the meetings and according to all accounts was a strong leader who exercised considerable control over who was allowed to speak and who was not He had studied philosophy under F S C Northrop and was familiar with Rudolf Carnaps propositional lOgic When he turned to neurophysiology he was driven by two questions as much philosophical as scientific What is a number that a man may know it and a man that he may know a num ber9 He sought the answers in a model of a neuron that he envisioned as having two aspectsone physical the other symboliC The McCulloch Pitts neuron as it came to be called was enormously influential Although it has now been modified in significant ways for a generation of researchers it provided the standard model of neural functioning In its day it repre sented a triumph of experimental work and theoretical reasoning As Steve Heims points out it was not easy to extrapolate from amorphous pink tissue on the laboratory table to the clean abstractions of the model 10 Before complicating our story by looking at the interplay between lOgical form and complex embodiment let us first consider the model on its own terms The McCullochPitts neuron has inputs that can be either excitatory or inhibitory A threshold determines how much excitation is needed for it to fire A neuron fires only if the excitation of its inputs exceeds the inhibition by at least the amount of the threshold Neurons are connected into nets Each net has a set ofinputs Signals coming in to neurons in the net an out put set signals leading out from neurons in the net and a set of internal states determined by input output and Signals from neurons that operate inside the net but are not connected to incoming or outgoing neurons McCullochs central inSight was that neurons connected in this way are ca pable of signifYing logical propositions For example if neurons A and Bare connected to C and both are necessary for C to fire this situation corre sponds to the proposition If A and B are both true then C is true If either A or B can cause C to fire the signified proposition is If A or B is true then C is true IfB is inhibitory and C will fire on input from A only if B does not fire the signified proposition is c is true only if A is true and B is not true This much McCulloch had formulated by 1941 when he met Walter Pitts a brilliant and eccentric seventeenyearold who was to become his most im portant collaborator11 Pitts worked out the mathematics proving several important theorems about neural nets In particular he showed that a neural net can calculate any number that is any proposition that can be calculated by a Turing machine12 The proof was important because it joined a model of human neural functioning with automata theory Demonstrating that the operations of a McCullochPitts neural net and a Turing machine formally converge confirmed McCullochs insight that brains do not secrete thought as the liver secretes bile but  they compute thought the way electronic computers calculate numbers13 Contesting for the Body of Information  Although McCulloch knew as well as anyone that the McCullochPitts neuron was a simplified schematic of an actual neurons complexity not to mention the brains complexity he pushed toward connecting the opera tions of a neural net directly with human thought In his view when a neu ron receives an input related to a sensory stimulus its firing is a direct consequence of something that happened in the external world When he says a proposition calculated by a neural net is true he means that the event to which the firing refers really happened How did McCulloch ac count for hallucinations and such phenomena as causalgia an amputees burning sensation that refers to a limb no longer present He proposed that neural nets can set up reverberating loops that once started continue fir ing even though no new Signals are incoming To distinguish between fir ings signifying an external event and those caused by past history he called the former signals and the latter signs A Signal always implies its occa sion but a sign is an enduring affair which has lost its essential temporal reference14 The multiple meanings that McCulloch and his colleagues attached to reverberating loops indicate how quickly speculation leaped from the simplified model to highly complex phenomena Lawrence Kubie linked reverberating loops with the repetitive and obsessive qualities of neuroses numerous Macy participants suggested that the loops could ac count for gestalt perception and McCulloch himself connected them not only with phYSical sensations but also with universals in philosophical thought lo5 The gap between the relatively simple model and the complex phenom ena it was supposed to explain is the subject of an exchange of letters be tween McCulloch and HansLukas Teuber a young psychologist who joined the Macy group on the fourth meeting and later became a coeditor of the published transcripts Here in correspondence with a junior col league McCulloch lays bare the assumptions that make embodied reality derivative from logical form In a letter dated November 101947 Teuber argues that similarity in outcome between different cybernetic systems does not necessarily imply similarity in structure or process Your robot may become capable of doing innumerable tricks the nervous system is able to do it is still unlikely that the nervous system uses the same methods as the robot in arriving at what might look like identical results Your mod els remain modelsunless some platonic demon mediate between the investigators of organic structure and the diagrammaking mathemati cians Only the psychologist he claims can give the neurophysiologist in formation on what the most relevant aspects of the recipient structures in sensory function might be16 Cybernetic mechanisms do not signify un 60  Chapter Three less they are connected with how perception actually takes place in human observers In his response on December 101947 McCulloch explained his posi tion I look to mathematics including symbolic logic for a statement of a theory in terms so general that the creations of God and man must exem plifY the processes prescribed by that theory Just because the theory is so general as to fit robot and man it lacks the specificity required to indicate mechanism in man to be the same as mechanism in robot In this argu ment universality is achieved by bracketing or blackbOxing the specific mechanisms It emerges by erasing particularity and looking for general forms Rhetorically however McCulloch presents the theory as though it preexisted specific mechanisms and then was later imperfectly instantiated in them This backhanded swing invests the theory with a coercive power that cannot be ignored for it expresses a law so general that every circuit built by God or man must exemplify itin some form 17 In actuality the theorem to which McCulloch refers is proved only in re lation to the simplified model of a McCullochPitts neural net It therefore can have the coercive power he claims for it only if the assumptions made for the model also hold for embodied actuality a congruence that can be ex act only if the model is as complex and noisy as reality itself Building such a model would of course defeat the purpose of modelmaking as Lewis Carroll and later Jorge Luis Borges playfully points out when he imagines a kings mad cartographer who is satisfied only when he creates a map that covers the entire kingdom reflecting its every detail in a scale of 1118 Teuber points to a gap when he ironically asks if some platonic demon is mediating between organic structure and abstract diagrams a gap that has not been closed despite McCullochs backhand volley In a feminist critique of the history oflogic Andrea Nye traces similar Platonic backhands that were made to develop a logiC coercive in its lawlike power 19 Nye points out that such moves are always made in specific politi cal and historical contexts in which they have important social implica tionsimplications that are masked by being presenting as preexisting laws of nature20 Like the logicians McCulloch stripped away context to expose or create a universal form But unlike the lOgicians McCulloch in 1947 does notwantto leave embodied reality behind He is searching for an empirical epistemology a way of combining embodied actuality with the force oflogical propositions Teubers objections hit a nerve or neuron be cause he insisted that the abstraction is not the actuality Dedicated to an empirical epistemology McCulloch cannot rest con tent with interpreting logical form as a universal command that embodied Contesting for the Body of Information I flesh must obey A suture is needed to bind the flesh more tightly to the model The suture appears in his invocation of mechanisms that had previ ously been blackboxed in his appeal to universality He recounts two in stances when circuits he had sketched out for patternrecognition in robots were identified by colleagues as accurate representations of the auditory and visual portions of the cortexin humans Now McCullochlike a knight that moved from the diagonal to attack the queen exposes the queen to the bishops attack as wellhas caught Teuber in a twopronged attack In the first approach humans and robots are judged alike because they obey the same universal law whatever their mechanisms In the sec ond approach humans and robots are judged alike because they use the same mechanisms This double attack is also invoked as we shall see in the next chapter by Norbert Wiener and his collaborators when a young up start philosopher took issue with their cybernetic manifesto It tends to appear when cybernetic arguments are challenged because it allows a de fense on two fronts Simultaneously If mechanisms are blackboxed so that only behavior counts humans and robots look the same because they can be made to behave the same If the black boxes are opened up and viewed from carefully controlled perspectives the mechanisms inside the boxes look the same again demonstrating the equivalence How can the queen be saved By recognizing that the abstractions here are multilayered When McCulloch goes down a level away from what in formation is toward what it does he still ends up several layers away from embodied complexity Consider his claim that patternrecognition circuits in a robot mechanism and in a human cortex are the same These circuits are diagrams that have been abstracted from two different kinds of embod iments neural tissue for the human and vacuum tubes or silicon chips for the robot Although there may be a level of abstraction at which similarities can be made to appear there is also a level of specificity at which differ ences create a Significant gap It depends on how the perspective is con structed Controlling the context particularly the movement from instantiated specificity to abstraction was crucial to constructing the path ways through which the McCullochPitts neuron was made to stand simul taneously for a computer code and for human thought Transforming the body into a flow of binary code pulSing through neurons was an essential step in seeing human being as an informational pattern In context this transformation can be seen as a necessary Simplification that made an im portant contribution to neurophysiology Taken out of context it is extrapo lated to the unwarranted conclusion that there is no essential difference between thought and code 62  Chapter Three I admire McCulloch because he made the audacious leap from amor phous tissue to lOgical model I admire him even more because he resisted the leap Although he emphasized the ability of his neurons to formulate propositions he never saw them as disembodied He was aware that infor mation moves only through signals and that Signals have existence only if they are embodied By definition a Signal is a proposition embodied in a physical process he asserted in a speech entitled How Nervous Struc tures Have Ideas to the American Neurological Association in 194921 In the context of his writing as a whole a commitment to embodiment exists in dynamic tension with an equally strong proclivity to see embodiment as the instantiation of abstract propositions This tension can be seen in the manuscript version of Whats in the Brain That Ink May Character dated August 28 1964 McCulloch re counts about a recent trip to Ravello I was told that an automaton or a nerve net like me was a mapping of a free monoid onto a semigroup with the possible addition of identity The parenthetical like me points up the incongruity between a highly abstract mathematical model involving monoids and semigroups and the embodied creature who pens these lines This is the same sort of nonsense one finds in the writings of those who never understood abstract form as an embodiment he continues It is like mistaking a Chomsky language for a real language You will find no such categorical confusion in the original Pitts and McCulloch of 1943 There the temporal propositional expressions are events occurring in time and space in a phYSically real net The postulated neurons for all their oversim plifications are still physical neurons as truly as the chemists atoms are physical atoms22 Here in the slippages between abstract propositions models of neurons and physically real nets we can see McCulloch trying to keep three balls in the air at once Although the neurons are onlypostu lated and are admittedly oversimplifications McCulloch fiercely wants to insist they are still phYSical Ifhe does not entirely succeed in creating an empirical epistemology he nevertheless achieves no small feat in insist ing that none of the balls can be dropped without sacrificing the complexi ties of embodied thought The McCullochPitts neuron is a liminal object part abstraction and part embodied actuality but other models were more firmly in the material realm Part of what made cybernetics convincing to Macy participants and others were the electromechanical devices that showed cybernetiC princi ples in action CybernetiCS was powerful because it worked If you dont be lieve watch William Grey Walters robot tortoise returning to its cage for an electrochemical nip when its batteries are running low or see Wieners Contesting for the Bode of Information  avoid it These devices were simple mechanisms by contemporary stan dards Nevertheless they served an important function because they acted as material instantiations of the momentous conclusion that humans and robots are siblings under the skin Particularly important for the Macy Con ferences were Shannons electronic rat a goalseeking machine that mod eled a rat learning a maze and Ross AshbyS homeostat a device that sought to return to a steady state when disturbed These artifacts functioned as ex changers that brought man and machine into equivalence they shaped the kinds of stories that participants would tell about the meaning of this equiv alence In conjunction with the formal theories they helped to construct the human as cyborg The Rat and the Homeostat Looping between Concept and Artifact There are moments of clarity when participants came close to explicitly ar ticulating the presuppositions informing the deep structure of the discus sion At the seventh conference John Stroud of the US Naval Electronic Laboratory in San Diego pOinted to the farreaching implications of Shannons construction of information through the binary distinction be tween Signal and noise Mr Shannon is perfectly justified in being as arbi trary as he wishes Stroud observed We who listen to him must always keep in mind that he has done so Nothing that comes out of rigorous argu ment will be uncontaminated by the particular set of decisions that were made by him at the beginning and it is rather dangerous at times to gener alize If we at any time relax our awareness of the way in which we Originally defined the signal we thereby automatically call all of the remainder of the received message the not signal or noise23 As Stroud realized Shannons distinction between Signal and noise had a conservative bias that privileges stasis over change Noise interferes with the messages exact replication which is presumed to be the desired result The structure of the theory im plied that change was deviation and that deviation should be corrected By contrast MacKays theory had as its generative distinction the difference in the state of the receivers mind before and after the message arrived In his model information was not opposed to change it was change Applied to goalseeking behavior the two theories pointed in different directions Privileging signal over noise Shannons theory implied that the goal was a preexisting state toward which the mechanism would move by making a series of distinctions between correct and incorrect choices The goal was stable and the mechanism would achieve stability when it reached 64  Chaprer Three the goal This construction easily led to the implication that the goal for mulated in general and abstract terms was less a specific site than stability itself Thus the construction ofinformation as a signalnoise distinction and the privileging of homeostasis produced and were produced by each other By contrast MacKays theory implied that the goal was not a fixed point but was a changing series of values that varied with context In his model set ting a goal temporarily marked a state that itself would become enfolded into a reflexive spiral of change In the same way that signalnoise and homeostasis went together so did reflexivity and information as a signifying difference These correlations imply that before Shannons electronic rat ever set marker in maze it was constituted through assumptions that affected how it would be interpreted Although Shannon called his device a mazesolv ing machine the Macy group quickly dubbed it a rat24 The machine con sisted of a fivebyfive square grid through which a sensing finger moved An electric jack that could be plugged into any of the twentyfive squares marked the goal and the machines task was to move through the squares by orderly search procedures until it reached the jack The machine could remember previous search patterns and either repeat them or not depending on whether they had been successful Although Heinz von Foerster Margaret Mead and Hans Teuberin their introduction to the eighth conference volumehighlighted the electronic rats significance they also acknowledged its limitations We all know that we ought to study the organism and not the computers if we wish to understand the organ ism Differences in levels of organization may be more than quantitative They go on to argue however that the computing robot provides us with analogs that are helpful as far as they seem to hold and no less helpful whenever they break down To find out in what ways a nervous system or a social group differs from our manmade analogs requires experiment These experiments would not have been considered if the analog had not been proposed25 There is another way to understand this linkage By suggesting certain kinds of experiments the analogs between intelligent machines and hu mans construct the human in terms of the machine Even when the experi ment fails the basic terms of the comparison operate to constitute the signifying difference If I say a chicken is not like a tractor I have character ized the chicken in terms of the tractor no less than when I assert that the two are alike In the same way whether they are understood as like or un like ranging human intelligence alongside an intelligent machine puts the two into a relay system that constitutes the human as a special kind of infor Contesting for the Body of Information  mation machine and the information machine as a special kind ofhuman26 Although some characteristics of the analogy may be explicitly denied the basic linkages it embodies cannot be denied for they are intrinsic to being able to think the model Presuppositions embodied in the electronic rat in clude the idea that both humans and cybernetic machines are goalseeking mechanisms that learn through corrective feedback to reach a stable state Both are information processors that tend toward homeostasis when they are functioning correctly Given these assumptions it was perhaps predictable that refleXivity should be constructed as neurosis in this model Shannon demonstrating how his electronic rat could get caught in a reflexive loop that would keep it Circling endlessly around remarked It has established a vicious circle or a singing condition27 Singing condition is a phrase that Warren McCulloch and Warren Pitts had used in an earlier presentation to de scribe neuroses modeled through cybernetic neural nets If machines are like humans in having neuroses humans are like machines in having neu roses that can be modeled mechanically Linking humans and machines in a common circuit the analogy constructs both of them as steady state sys tems that become patholOgical when they fall into reflexivity This kind of mutually constitutive interaction belies the implication inscribed in the volumes introduction that such analogs are neutral heuristic devices More accurately they are relay systems that transport assumptions from one arena to the next28 The assumptions traveling across the relay system set up by homeostasis are perhaps most visible in the discussion ofW Ross AshbyS homeostat 29 The homeostat was an electrical device constructed with transducers and variable resistors When it received an input changing its state it searched for the configuration of variables that would return it to its initial condition Ashby explained that the homeostat was meant to model an organism which must keep essential variables within preset limits to survive He em phaSized that the cost of exceeding those limits is death If homeostasis equals safety Your life would be safe Ashby responded when demon strating how the machine could return to homeostasis departure from homeostasis threatens death p 79 One of his examples concerns an engi neer sitting at the control panel of a ship The engineer functions like a homeostat striving to keep the dials within certain limits to prevent cata strophe Human and machine are alike in needing stable interior environ ments The human keeps the shipS interior stable and this stability preserves the homeostasis of the humans interior in turn allOwing the hu man to continue to ensure the shipS homeostasis Arguing that homeosta 66  Chapter Three sis is a requirement uniform among the inanimate and the animate Ashby privileged it as a universally desirable state p 73 The postwar context for the Macy Conferences played an important role in formulating what counted as homeostasis Given the cataclysm of the war it seemed selfevident that homeostasis was meaningful only ifit included the environment as part of the picture Thus Ashby conceived of the homeostat as a device that included both the organism and the environment Our ques tion is how the organism is going to struggle with its environment he re marked and if that question is to be treated adequately we must assume some speCific environment pp 7374 This specificity was expressed through the homeostats four units which could be arranged in various con figurations to simulate organismplusenvironment For example one unit could be designated organism and the remaining three the environment in another arrangement three of the units might be the organism with the remaining one the environment Formulated in general terms the prob lem the homeostat addressed was this given some function of the environ ment E can the organism find an inverse function 1 such that the product of the two will result in a steady state When Ashby asked Macy participants whether such a solution could be found for highly nonlinear systems Julian Bigelow correctly answered In general no p 75 Yet as Walter Pitts ob served the fact that an organism continues to live means that a solution does exist More preCisely the problem was whether a solution could be articu lated within the mathematical conventions and technologies of representa tion available to express it These limits in tum were constituted through the models specificities that translated between the question in the abstract and the particular question posed by that experiment Thus the emphasis shifted from finding a solution to stating the problem This dynamic appears repeatedly throughout the Macydiscussions Par ticipants increasingly understood the ability to specifY exactly what was wanted as the limiting factor for building machines that could perform hu man functions Von Neumann stated the thesis at the first conference and Walter Pitts restated it near the end of the meetings at the ninth confer ence At the very beginning of these meetings Pitts recalled the ques tion was frequently under discussion of whether a machine could be built which would do a particular thing and of course the answer which every body has realized by now is that as long as you definitely speCify what you want the machine to do you can in principle build a machine to do it p 107 After the conferences were over McCulloch repeated this dy namic in Embodiments of Mind EchOing across two decades the assertion has important implications for language Contesting for the Body of Information I If what is exactly stated can be done by a machine the residue of the uniquely human becomes coextensive with the linguistic qualities that in terfere with precise specificationambiguity metaphoric play multiple encoding and allusive exchanges between one symbol system and another The uniqueness of human behavior thus becomes assimilated to the ineffa bility of language and the common ground that humans and machines share is identified with the univocality of an instrumental language that has banished ambiguity from its lexicon Through such chunking processes the constellations of homeostasis and reflexivity assimilated other elements into themselves On the side of homeostasis was instrumental language whereas ambiguity allusion and metaphor stood with reflexivity By todays standards Ashbys homeostat was a simple machine but it had encoded within it a complex network of assumptions Paradoxically the models simplicity facilitated the overlay of assumptions onto the arti fact for its very lack of complicating detail meant that the model stood for much more than it physically enacted During discussion Ashbyacknowl edged that the homeostat was a simple model and asserted that he would like to get on to the more difficult case of the clever animal that has a lot of nervous system and is nevertheless trying to get itself stable p 97 The slippage between the simplicity of the model and the complexity of the phenomena did not go unremarked J Z Young from the Anatomy De partment at University College London sharply responded Actually that is experimentally rather dangerous You are all talking about the cortex and you have it very much in mind Simpler systems have only a limited number of possibilities p 100 Yet the simpler systems helped to reinforce sev eral ideas humans are mechanisms that respond to their environments by trying to maintain homeostasis the function of scientific language is exact speCification the bottleneck for creating intelligent machines lies in for mulating problems exactly and an information concept that privileges ex actness over meaning is therefore more suitable to model construction than one that does not Ashbys homeostat Shannons information theory and the electronic rat were collaborators in constructing an interconnected network of assumptions about language teleology and human behavior3o These assumptions did not go uncontested The concept that most clearly brought them into question was reflexivity As we have seen during the Macy Conferences reflexivity was a nebulous cluster that was not ex pliCitly named as such To give the flavor of the discussions that both in voked the possibility of reflexivity and failed to coalesce into coherent theory about it we can consider the image of the maninthemiddle The image was given currency by World War II engineering technolOgies that 68  ChapTer Three aimed to improve human performance by splicing humans into feedback loops with machines The image takes center stage in the sixth conference during John Strouds analysis of an operator sandwiched between a radar tracking device on one side and an antiaircraft gun on the other The gun operator Stroud observed is surrounded on both sides by very precisely known mechanisms and the question comes up What kind of a machine have we put in the middle 31 The image as Stroud used it constructs the man as an inputoutput device Information comes in from the radar trav els through the man and goes out through the gun The man is significantly placed in the middle of the circuit where his output and his input are al ready spliced into an existing loop Were he at the end it might be neces sary to consider more complex factors such as how he was interacting with an openended and unpredictable environment The focus in Strouds pre sentation was on how information is transformed as it moves through the maninthemiddle As with the electronic rat and the homeostat the em phaSiS was on predictability and homeostatic stability Countering this view was Frank FremontSmiths insistence on the ob servers role in constructing the image of the maninthemiddle Proba bly man is never only between the two machines he pOinted out Certainly he is never only in between two machines when you are studying him because you are the other man who is making an input into the man You are studying and changing his relation to the machines by virtue of the fact that you are studying him FremontSmiths introduction of the ob server was addressed by Stroud in a revealing image that sought to convert the observerinto a maninthemiddle The human being is the most mar velous set of instruments Stroud observed but like all portable instru ment sets the human observer is noisy and erratic in operation However if these are all the instruments you have you have to work with them until something better comes along32 In Strouds remark the man is converted from an openended system into a portable instrument set The instrument may not be phYSically connected to two mechanistic terminals the image implied but this lack of tight connection only makes the splice invisible It does not negate the suture that constructs the human as an information processing machine spliced into a closed circuit that ideally should be homeostatic in its operation however noisy it is in practice FremontSmith responded You cannot pOSSibly Dr Stroud eliminate the human being Therefore what I am saying and trying to emphaSize is that with all their limitations it might be pertinent for those scientific in vestigators atthe general level who find to their horror that we have to work with human beings to make as much use as possible of the inSights avail Contesting for the Body of Information I able as to what human beings are like and how they operate33 As his switch to formal address indicates FremontSmith was upset at the recu peration of his comment back into the ideology of objectivism His com ment cuts to the heart of the objection against reflexivity Just as with MacKays model of structural information reflexivity opens the manin themiddle to psychological complexity so that he can no longer be con structed as a black box functioning as an inputoutput device The fear is that under these conditions reliable quantification becomes elusive or im possible and science slips into subjectivity which to many conferees meant that it was not real science at all Confirming traditional ideas of how sci ence should be done in a postwar atmosphere that was already clouded by the hysteria of McCarthyism homeostasis implied a return to normalcy in more than one sense The thrust of FremontSmiths observations was of course to intimate that psychological complexity was unavoidable The responses of other participants reveal that this implication was preCisely what they were most concerned to deny They especially disliked reflexive considerations that took the personal form of suggesting that their statements were not asser tions about the world but were revelations of their own internal states The primary spokesperson for this disconcerting possibility was Lawrence Kubie a psychoanalyst from the Yale University Psychiatric Clinic In cor respondence Kubie enraged other participants by interpreting their criti cisms of his theories as evidence of their subconscious resistances rather than as matters for scientific debate In his presentations he was more tact ful but the reflexive thrust of his arguments remained clear His presenta tions occupy more space in the published transcripts than those of any other participant composing about onesixth of the total Although he met with repeated skepticism among the physical scientists he continued to defend his position At the center of his explanation was the multiply encoded nature oflanguage which operated at once as an instrument that the speaker could use to communicate and as a reflexive mirror that re vealed more than the speaker knew Like MacKays theory of information Kubies psychoanalytic approach built reflexivity into the model Also like MacKays theory Kubies argument met the greatest conscious resis tance in the demand for reliable quantification Kubies ideas will serve as a springboard for looking at the role that re flexivity played in the Macy Conferences and in the lives of some partici pants after the conferences ended particularly the lives of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson and their daughter Mary Catherine Bateson Con trasting the Macy Conferences with Catherine Batesons account of a simi 70  Chapter Three lar conference held in 1968 will illustrate why the full implications of re flexivity could scarcely have been admitted during the Macy period Once the observer is made a part of the picture cracks in the frame radiate out ward until the perspectives that controlled context are fractured as irre trievably as a safetyglass windshield hit by a large rock The Macy participants were right to feel wary about reflexivity Its potential was every bit as explosive as they suspected Kubies Last Stand Lawrence Kubie had been trained as a neurophysiologist He won McCul lochs admiration for his 1930 paper suggesting that neuroses were caused by reverberating loops similar to those McCulloch later modeled in neural nets34 In midcareer Kubie converted to psychoanalysis By the time of the Macy Conferences he was affiliated with the hardline Freudianism of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute In his presentation at the sixth confer ence he laid out the fundamentals of his position Neurotic processes are dominated by unconscious motivations As goalseeking behavior these processes are ineffective because the unconscious pursues its goals in sym bolic form A man wants to feel secure and money symbolizes this security for him But when he acquires money he still does not feel secure He has acquired the symbol but lacks what the symbol represents With the gap between desire and reality yawning as widely as ever he may actually feel more rather than less anxious as he approaches his putative goal Although McCulloch thought of Kubie as an experimentalist from the beginning of the conferences Kubie resisted the reductive approach that was characteristic of McCullochs work At the first conference Kubie ex pressed uneasiness over reducing complex psychological phenomena to mechanistic models equating humans and automata At the sixth confer ence he was still resisting In Neurotic Potential and Human Adaptation he explained why he had not addressed feedback mechanisms I wanted to make clear the complexity and subtlety of the neurotic process as it is en countered clinically Without this we are constantly in danger of oversim plifying the problem so as to scale it down for mathematical treatment35 Instead of mechanistic models his formulations emphasized the reflexivity of psychological processes At the seventh conference in The Relation of Symbolic Function in Language Formation and in Neurosis he insisted on the fact that the human organism has two symboliC functions and not one One is language The other is neurosis Moreover the two functions converge into the same utterance FremontSmith drove the point home Contesting for the Body of Information  7 What Dr Kubie is really trying to say is that language is a double coding both a statement about the outside and a statement about the inside It is that doubleness which gives this consciousunconscious quality to it 36 In this view a statement intended as an observation of the external world is pierced by reflections of the speakers interior state including neurotic processes of which the speaker is not conscious If a scientist denies this is the case insisting that he or she speaks solely about external reality these objections themselves can be taken as evidence of unconscious motiva tions For experimentalists like McCulloch concerned to give an objective account of mental processes psychoanalysis was the devils plaything be cause it collapsed the distance between speaker and language turning what should be scientific debate into a tar baby that clung to them the more they tried to push it away The damage that this view of reflexive utterance could do to scientific objectivity was dramatically laid out by McCulloch in a 1953 address to the Chicago Literary Club Entitled The Past of a Delusion the speech was a fiery denunciation of Freudian psychoanalysis37 If all scientific utterance is tinged with subjectivity McCulloch felt then scientific theory must inex tricably be tied to the foibles and frailties of humans as subjective beings To show the disastrous effects that this close coupling could have on sci ence McCulloch took as his case study Freudian psychoanalysis a theory that in his view both promoted the idea of close coupling and itself insidi ously instantiated it McCulloch ripped into Freud suggesting that Freud had turned to psychoanalysis because he had wanted to make more money than he would have as a Jewish medical doctor McCulloch recounted Freuds sex life intimating that Freud put sexuality at the heart of his the ory because he was sexually frustrated himself McCulloch denounced psy choanalysts as charlatans who motivated by greed kept treating their patients as long as those patients had money to pay He sneered at the empirical evidence used by Freud and other psychoanalysts In his ironic conclusion McCulloch cautioned his audience not to try to argue with psy choanalysts All they would get for their pains he predicted were psycho analytic interpretations of their objections as evidence of their own unconscious hostilities Kubie learned of this speech from a colleague who had been in the audi ence38 Although McCulloch went out of his way to exempt Kubie from his general scorn for psychoanalysis in a 1950 letter to FremontSmith he had written Of all the psychoanalysts I know Kubie has the clearest head for theory39 the attack was too stinging not to draw a rejOinder As pat as McCulloch would have wished Kubie interpreted the speech as a sign of 72  Chapter Three McCullochs own psychological distress Speaking to a colleague Kubie noted that McCullochs vitriole may be due to an accumulation of personal frustrations of his own displaced onto analysis4o Later when he heard about McCullochs erratic behavior during a presentation at Yale he wrote to McCullochs host sending a copy of the letter to FremontSmith I am distressed by this news about Warren  in him the boundary between sickness and health has always been narrow p 137 Kubie even tried to arrange for psychoanalysts in the Boston area to meet with McCulloch on a social pretext if necessary with a view to getting him the help that Kubie thought he needed p 138 As Steve Heims observes in his account of these incidents McCulloch would have been enraged had he known about Kubies attempts at intervention McCullochs The Past of a Delusion is vivid evidence that Fremont Smiths attempts at reconciliation between psychoanalysts and physical sci entists did not succeed Kubie was well aware of the experimentalists attitudes After repeated attempts to win them over he delivered his final presentation at the ninth conference in what sounds like a state of con trolled rage He likened the supposed troublemaker psychiatrist to a naturalist reporting on the facts of human nature as observed by him By contrast he noted the physical scientists ignore complex psychological phenomena in favor of the Simplifications of an abstract model The ex perimentalist and mathematician then after their explanation whereupon the naturalist presents additional observations which confront the experi mentalist and the mathematician with an even more complex version of natural phenomena As the cycle continues these new complexities are accepted with increasing reluctance and skepticism41 In these remarks Kubie presented his version of his presentations at the Macy Conferences He merely reported on the facts whereas the others offered inadequate mechanistic explanations for them This characterization ignores of course the Freudian framework he used to interpret his colleagues be havior a framework at least as theoryladen in its observations as anything McCulloch proposed42 I think of this presentation loaded with controlled anger as if in pointcounterpoint to McCullochs extravagant display of anger in his speech of the follOwing year as Kubies last stand The resistance it de scribes and inscribes went in both directions from the psychoanalyst to the experimentalist and from the experimentalist to psychoanalyst For the ex perimentalists psychoanalYSiS strengthened the chain of association that bound refleXivity together with subjectivity for it added to the already daunting problems of quantification the unfalsifiable notion of the uncon Contesting for the Body of Information I scious It is no wonder that reHexivity came to seem for many of the partic ipants a dead end for legitimate scientific inquiry Even as one version of reHexivity fizzled out other versions were being constructed in terms that made them more productive in part because these versions avoided associating reHexivitywith the unconscious Temple Burling reading the published transcripts in 1954 wrote to McCulloch I was surprised at the jamb that the group got into at this late date over the question of  the unconscious It seems to me that is putting the cart before the horse It isnt unconscious neuro activity that is puzzling but conscious Consciousness is the great mystery43 Burlings comments point to an other way into reHexivity a way taken by a handful of participants including Heinz von Foerster Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson Though they were not necessarily opposed to psychoanalytic interpretation it was not the focus of their attention The scale on which they wanted to play their tunes did not run up and down the consciousunconscious keyboard Rather they wanted to create models that would take into account the ob servers role in constructing the system The important dichotomy for them was observersystem and the important problems were how to locate the observer inside the system and the system inside the observer Circling the Observer In 1969 near the end of his career FremontSmith wrote or rather had his secretary write to participants of the various Macy Conferences that he had organized over three decades asking for their evaluation of the inter disciplinary programs and the discussion formats The inquiry was clearly a careerclOSing move he was looking for affirmation of what he considered his lifework Some of the replies were disarmingly frank Jimmie Savage wrote about how it feltto be a young man allowed to hobnob with such a di verse group ofillustrious and brilliant people He recalled that he had fre quently found himself thinking that the emperor had no clothes but wondering ifhe could trust his own feelings He confessed Cybernetics it self seemed to me to be mostly baloney44 R W Gerard expressed similar dissatisfactions recalling being intensely frustrated by the perpetual tan gents to tangents that developed during a meeting and the rare satisfaction of intellectual closure and completion of any line of thought or argument He added You may recall that this frustration was sufficient so that I did not wish to attend later meetings45 These responses are interesting not only because they throw light on the conferences but also because they talk frankly about feelings Affect ran high Savage recalled In the 74  Chapter Three transcripts by contrast emotions enter the discussion only as objects for scientific modeling Almost never are they articulated as something the participants are experiencing The contrast between the letters and the transcripts illuminates the scientific ethos that ruled at the meetings Emo tions were considered out of bounds for several reasons all of which per haps came down to the same reason The framework of scientific inquiry had been constructed so as to ignore the observer Heinz von Foerster in his letter to FremontSmith saw the inclusion of the observer as the central issue of cybernetics 46 He noted that at the begin ning of the century with the advent of relativity theory and the Uncertainty Principle a most enigmatic object was discovered which until then was carefully excluded from all scientific discourse the observer Who is he was the question indignantly asked by those who subscribed to a sour grape strategy and seriously asked by those who felt that any science worth its name must include the subject that makes the observations at the first place There were no precedents for this inclusion he continued The whole methodology of a science that includes the observer had to be developed from scratch He generously credited FremontSmith with the idea of bringing together people rather than disciplines and thus placing relation ships at the center of the discussions although the transcripts rarely ac knowledge these relationships He also commented that FremontSmith understood that including the observer would have to be an interdisciplinary task In establishing the focus as problems of communication Fremont Smith hoped the Macy group would see that the topic required an intensive and comprehensive study of man Thus the sciences were to be unified by an overarching framework that could simultaneously explain man and the people who studied man Cybernetics was to provide that framework In March 1976 two decades after the conferences had ended Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson were sitting with Stewart Brand at Batesons kitchen table in a rare joint interview Brand asked them about the Macy Conferences They agreed that including the observer was one of the cen tral problems raised by the cybernetic paradigm Reaching for a scrap of paper Bateson sketched a diagram which Brand included in the published interview of the communication system as it was envisioned before cyber netics The drawing shows a black box with input output and feedback loops within the box The space labeled Engineer remains outside the box A second drawing represents Batesons later understanding of cyber netics Here the first black box along with the names Wiener Bateson Mead is encapsulated within a larger box In this drawing the observers are included within the system rather than looking at it from the out Contesting for the Body of Information  side The interview turned to a discussion of the dynamics that had pre vailed at the Macy Conferences Mead commented Kubie was a very im portant person at that point She added McCulloch had a grand design in his mind He got people into that conference who he then kept from talk ing Bateson continued Yes he had a design for how the shape of the con versation would run over five yearswhat had to be said before what else could be said When Brand asked what that design was Bateson an swered Who knows But Mead thought it was more or less what hap pened47 Brand wanted to know why cybernetics had run out of steam What happened he asked repeatedly His sense of the situation is confirmed by correspondence exchanged between the transcript editorsHeinz von Foerster Margaret Mead and Hans Teuberafter the tenth conference in 1953 Fremont Smith and McCulloch wanted the transcripts published just as the transcripts for the previous four conferences had been pub lished But Teuber disagreed noting that the discussions were too rambling and unfocused if published he said they would be an embar rassment Although he was the junior member of the editorial board he stood his ground He wrote to Fremont Smith sending a copy of the letter to McCulloch that if the others decided to publish over his objections he wanted his name removed from the list of editors48 As the junior member he had the most to lose the others already had established reputations McCulloch must have written a stiff note in reply for Teuber answered de fenSively He insisted that the issue was not his reputation but the quality of the transcripts From your note it is obvious that I sound stuffY to you and Walter Do tell him that I wanted to get off the list of editors not because I am worried about reputations but Simply because I cant do enough for this transcript to get it into any sort of shape The transactions of this last meet ing simply do not add to the earlier onesthey detract Granted there are a few sparks but there is not enough of the old fire lowed it to you and Frank FremontSmith to speak my mind on this matter49 Mead worked out a compromise The three speakers would publish their talks as formal papers and McCullochs summary of all the conferences would be used as an introduction No one thought of suggesting more conferences or more transcripts It was the end of an era But not the end of reflexivity Although a reflexive view of cybernetics failed to coalesce into a coherent theory during the Macy Conferences Bateson did not want to let the idea go He determined to go ahead on his own He organized a conference in July 1968 to explore how the reflexive implications of cybernetics could provide the basis for a new epistemology and he invited a group of scientists social scientists and humanists In cluded were Warren McCulloch and Gordon Pask both central players in cybernetics along with Mary Catherine Bateson known as Catherine to her father as Cap an anthropologist specializing in comparative reli gions Out of this weeklong conference came Catherines 1972 book Our awn Metaphor 50 Her account of this conference in some ways a reflection of the MacyConferences contrasts sharply with the Macytranscripts The best explanation for this difference I think is epistemological Catherine assumes that of course the observer affects what is seen so she takes care to tell her readers about her state of mind and situation at the time She re counts for example finding out that she was pregnant in the months pre ceding the conference how awed she felt by the life that whether she consciously attended to it or not continued to grow within her and her devastation when the baby was born prematurely lived for an afternoon and died Her grief was still fresh when she attended the conference and it naturally colored she feels how she interpreted what she learned there The difference between her account and the Macy transcripts does not lie in the fact that one is technical and the other anecdotal It is obviously important to Catherine to understand as clearly as possible what each pre senter is saying and she skillfully guides her reader through presentations fully as complex technical and detailed as any in the Macy transcripts Rather the difference lies in her attitude toward her material and her de termination to include as much of the context as she can She takes care to tell her readers not only what ideas were exchanged but also how the people looked and her interpretation of how they were feeling In addition to the words exchanged she includes appearance body language and emotional atmosphere At the Macy Conferences her mother Margaret Mead had repeatedly cautioned that the transcripts were a purely verbal record and therefore represented only a fraction of the communication taking place Mead wanted a much fuller record that would include pos ture gesture and intonation 51 Two decades later Catherine fulfilled that desire in her precisely crafted descriptions Here is Catherines account of Warren McCulloch Warren had bright fierce eyes and held his head dropped low between thin shoul ders He had white hair and a white beard and curious blend of glee and grief of belligerence and gentleness aaM pp 2324 When he gave a presentation Catherine strained to follow his ideas and found it odd that he was not more responsive to the needs and situations of those who were listening More than anyone else present Warren tended to use an Contesting for the Body of Information  uncompromisingly technical vocabulary referring to scientists I knew nothing of and calling on unfamiliar mathematics and neurophysiology As I listened I kept checking to see whether I was sorting out what each example was about what kind of thing he was trying to say in this inter disciplinary context where not more than two or three people could follow the substance of most of his examples OOM p 65 In her con textualized account McCullochs fierce commitment to an empirical epistemology carries with it an obvious pricea tendency toward de contextualization that made him less than effective in communicating with this audience Catherine Bateson included in her prologue Gregory Batesons docu ment that set the agenda for the conference and laid out the problems it would explore The influence of cybernetics as it had evolved during the Macy Conferences is apparent throughout Equally clear are Gregorys re visions critiques and transformations of those concepts He indicated that he wanted participants to consider three cybernetic or homeostatic sys terns the individual the society and the larger global ecosystem in which both are embedded Although consciousness would be considered as an important component in the coupling of these systems OOM p 13 epis temologically its role was limited From an enormously great plethora of mental events it chooses a few on which to focus 00 M p 16 An impor tant factor guiding this choice he hypothesized is purpose Problems arise when this purposeful selection is taken as the whole If consciousness has feedback upon the remainder of mind and if consciousness deals only with a skewed sample of the events of the total mind then there must exist a systematic ie nonrandom difference between the conscious views of self and the world and the true nature of selfand the world OOM p 16 Thus the emphasis on purpose so central to the Macy Conferences be came here not an assumed orientation but a lens that consciousness wears and that distorts what it sees Specifically this lens obscures the cybernetic nature of self and the world an obfuscation that tends to be imperceptible to consciousness OOM p16 Nowhere is the transformation that Gregory worked on the Macy Con ferences clearer than in what he considers the cybernetic nature of world and self For him cybernetics is no longer the homeostatic model of the Macy Conferences although echoes of this language still linger  Rather it has become the reflexivity of the larger box that he would sketch a decade later at his kitchen table Equally striking is the changed significance of separating a system from its surrounding context For Bateson decontex tualization is not a necessary scientific move but a systematic distortion 78  Chapter Three The inclination of the conscious mind toward purpose makes it focus on an arc of causally related events leading to a perceived goal Obliterated or for gotten is the matrix in which these arcs are embedded A truly cybernetic approach for Bateson concentrates on the couplings that bind the parts into interactive wholes The revisionist thrust of Gregorys view of cybernetics is apparent in a letter he wrote to Catherine in June 1977 a year after his interview with Stewart Brand The letter begins with Gregory remarking on how reread ing Our Own Metaphor vividly brought the conference back to his mind Then Gregory lays out the gist of his new cybernetic epistemology He starts from the premise that we never know the world as such We know only what our sensory perceptions construct for us In this sense we know nothing about the world But we know something and what we know is the end result of the internal processes we use to construct our inner world Thus we know ourselves as complex beings including processes that extend below consciousness and beyond ourselves out into the world through the inner world available to a consciousness that exists only be cause of those processes We are our epistemology is Gregorys formula tion52 Catherines phrasing is similar Each person is his own central metaphor DDM p 285 In this view the dualism between subject and object disappears for the object as a thing in itself cannot exist for us There is only the subjective inner world The world as this cybernetics con structs it is a monism Nevertheless it is not solipSistic for Gregory be lieves that the microcosm of the inner world is functional within the larger ecosystem only because it is an appropriate metaphor for the macrocosm In her concluding chapter Catherine amplifies on this view by supposing that we can understand the complexity of the outer world only because our codes for constructing the inner world are Similarly diverse and complex In this sense we are a metaphor not only for ourselves but also for the larger system in which we are embedded This leads her into a subtly nuanced analysis of couplings between inner world and outer world including the inSight that because the worlds are coupled they must in the last analysis be regarded as a Single system For Gregory McCulloch represents a Moseslike figure who could lead others to the brink of this new epistemology but was unable to enter into it himself His last speech makes a special sort of sense if you read it as spoken in that context Gregory suggests53 Catherine uses McCullochs speech to end her account of the conference and the speech is worth quot ing in detail I am by nature a warrior and wars dont make sense any more McCulloch begins DDM p 311 The recognition rings true I Contesting for the Body of Information  think of the statement in his summary of the Macy Conferences Our most notable agreement is that we have learned to know one another a bit better and to fight fair in our shirt sleeves54 For him scientific debate was a form of agonistic conflict He continues in his speech by recalling the nittygritty details of his experimental work its difficulties and funny moments Then his thoughts tum to human mortality He is an old man although he can not know it now within a year he will die Earlier in the conference he snapped says Catherine I dont particularly like people Never have Man to my mind is about the nastiest most destructive of all the animals I dont see any reason ifhe can evolve machines that can have more fun than he himself can why they shouldnt take over enslave us quite happily They might have a lot more fun Invent better games than we ever did DDM p 226 N ow at the penultimate moment of the conference of Catherines book that she will dedicate to him and of his life he confesses to mortal feelings The difficulty is that we who are not singlecell organisms cannot simply divide and pass on our programs We have to couple and there is behind this a second requirement Warren began to weep We learn  that theres a utility in death because  the world goes on changing and we cant keep up with it In have any disciples you can say this of every one of them they think for themselves DDM p 311 If Gregory Bateson thought of himself as McCullochs disciple the epi taph that McCulloch wanted for himself is certainly true in Batesons case for he both learned from his mentor and went beyond him Taking the cy berneticparadigm of McCullochs empirical epistemology and making it into our own metaphor Bateson reintroduced the reflexive dimension that McCulloch had fought so hard to exorcise when it was associated with psychoanalysis Yet Batesons reinterpretation succeeded in articulating a version of reflexivity that did not depend on a psychoanalytic entanglement of conscious and unconscious meanings in scientific statements Moreover his epistemology gave an important role to objective constraints for it in sisted that only those constructions that were compatible with reality were conducive to longterm survival And survival was very much the name of the game for Catherine and Gregory Bateson The larger issues they wanted their conference to address included the increasing degradation of the environment In looking for an epistemology that would proceed from a sense of the worlds complexity they did not give up the idea that some constructions are better than others Let me now anticipate connections between the path the Batesons fol lowed and those paths traced in subsequent chapters In breaking new con 80  Chapter Three ceptual ground Gregory Bateson drew on a famous article on the frogs vi sual cortex The article had been coauthored by several people from the Macy Conferences including Warren McCulloch Walter Pitts and Jerome Lettvin also listed as coauthor was a newcomer who did not attend the Macy Conferences Humberto Maturana55 In using this article to de velop our own metaphor Bateson went where no experimentalist could easily follow for he made speculative leaps that would take decades of ex perimental work to confirm He went into the inner world and turned it in side out so to speak so that the inner world became a metaphor for the outer world Maturana was to follow a similar yet different path He went into the inner world and insisted that it cant be turned inside out that it is a metaphor for nothing other than its own creation of itself as a system This is the theory of autopoiesis which we will discuss in chapter 6 Maturana did not identifY with cybernetics as much as Bateson did and he did not generally use that term to describe his work Nevertheless his theory took up certain problems that were left hanging after the Macy Conferences ended Like Bateson Maturana found reflexivity more promising than homeostasis Also like Bateson he both appropriated concepts from the Macy context and changed them profoundly Janet FreudFreed Like Bateson Mead and Brand sitting at a kitchen table on that March morning in 1976 I am sitting at my kitchen table in March 1996 Im look ing at the pages on which their interview is published Im particularly in trigued by a photograph that Brand included one evidently given to him by Mead or Bateson Its a large picture too large to include in one frame so it stretches across two pages The caption identifies the setting as the 1952 Macy Conferencethe ninth the conference with the last real Macy tran script for the tenth volume as noted above was not a transcript but was in stead formal papers This was the conference of Kubies last stand The photograph shows a large group of men and one woman  Margaret Mead sitting around clothcovered tables pulled into a Vshape A speaker stands at the mouth of the V the caption identifies him as Yehoshua Bar Hillel But wait That must mean the date is incorrect since BarHillel spoke at the tenth conference He wasnt present at the ninth So this pho tograph must have been taken in 1953 at the conference in which the con versation was so meandering and dilatory that it couldnt be published I wonder where the caption came from I imagine Bateson digging out the photograph and giving it to Brand while he and Mead clue Brand in on who Contesting for the Body of Information  was who as Brand scribbles down the names probably while they are all still sitting at the kitchen table Now I notice that Mead isnt the only woman in the picture Another woman sits with her back to the photographer her arms extended hands reaching out to a machine I cant quite see The caption identifies her as Janet Freud but I know this cant be right either She must be Janet Freed listed in the published transcripts as assistant to the conference program I have seen her name in the typed transcripts of the editorial meetings that followed the later conferences and I know more or less what she did She was responsible for turning these mens and a couple of womens words into type She was the one who listened to the taperecordings of the early conferences and strained to catch inaudible strange words When she sent McCulloch the typed transcript of the second Macy conference she plaintively wrote that she knew there were many many blank spaces but that Dr FremontSmith had ordered her and her staff to listen to the recordings only twice and to type what they heard56 Evidently transcrib ing the taperecordings was taking too much staff time and Fremont Smith did not want to waste his resources that wayhis resources her time The quirk of memory or handwriting that made Brand call her Janet Freud seems eerily appropriate for this was the woman who like Freuds patients had no voice in the transcripts although the transcripts have a voice that we can read only because of her She was the one who preSided over the physical transformations of signifiers as they went from tape recording to transcript to revised copy to galley to book Othersthe edi tors Teuber Mead and von Foerster the organizer FremontSmith and the chairman McCullochworried about contentbut her focus was the materiality of the processes that make sounds into words marks into books She did the best she could but the transcription took much time and she had many other things to do When she was told not to take time the tran script had more ellipses than words and she felt bad What to do She sug gested to FremontSmith that he and McCulloch insist the speakers deliver drafts of their talks ahead of time57 Then she wouldnt have to strain to listen to taperecordings that were noisy beyond endurance by to days standards She wouldnt have to guess at unfamiliar words the manu scripts of the transcripts are peppered with misspellings She learned stenotypography or perhaps arranged to hire someone else who knew it so that the words could be transcribed directly into the machine This com bined with the drafts of the presentations allowed her to come up with rea 82  Chapter Three sonable transcripts of both presentation and discussion without driving herself crazy At an editorial meeting when others suggested that it was too much work to pressure the speakers to get their drafts into the office ahead of time she spoke up The drafts were essential She defended the other woman who was lower on the totem pole than she washer staffand said that this woman could be expected to do only so much She didnt say so but surely she had herself in mind as well Janet Freeds role in the Macy group is teasingly hinted at in the tran scripts to the 1949 Editors Meeting FremontSmith depended on her to keep him on track He decided to make up a little booklet for the Macy Conference chairmen to supply them with guidelines commenting It oc curred to us in fact it was Miss Freeds suggestion   Elsewhere when he realized that he had jumped around a good deal and gotten off track he referred to the list of topics that Freed had made up for him to follow  58 When one of the men remarked that there were now thirteen Macy groups and wondered ifhis office was going to be able to do it FremontSmith must have looked at Freed for he uttered a comment that in this profes sional and overwhelmingly male meeting comes across as almost shocking in its personal nature You write and get a lovely smile Do you have any thing else you want to say at this point No she replies not elaborating Nowhere else in the Macy transcripts to my knowledge does someone simply answer No Perhaps she was embarrassed or perhaps she simply felt her position made it inappropriate for her to say more FremontSmiths remark faithfully preserved by the transcription tech nologies that Janet Freed oversaw has a slightly odd phrasing and I puzzle over it She writes and gets a smile as if she had to go somewhere to fetch it as if it were produced elsewhere and transported back to her face I feel I dont know where the smile comes from because Janet Freed effaces her self Rarely do we see her directly we glimpse her largely through her re flections in the speech of others More than anyone else she qualifies as the outside observer who watches a system that she constructs through the marks she makes on paper although the system itself has a great deal of trouble including her within the names of those people who are authorized to speak and make meaning What are we to make ofJ anet F this sign of the repressed this Freudian slip of a female who with a flick of a u the U shaped table at which she sits goes from Freed to Freud Freud to Freed Thinking of her I am re minded of Dorothy Smiths suggestion that men of a certain class are prone to decontextualization and reification because they are in a position to com mand the labors of others59 Take a letter Miss Freed he says Miss Contesting for the Body of Information I Freed comes in She gets a lovely smile The man speaks and she writes on her stenography pad or perhaps on her stenography typewriter The man leaves He has a plane to catch a meeting to attend When he returns the letter is on his desk awaiting his signature From his point of view what has happened He speaks giving commands or dictating words and things happen A woman comes in marks are inscribed onto paper letters appear conferences are arranged books are published Taken out of context his words fly by themselves into books The full burden of the labor that makes these things happen is for him only an abstraction a resource di verted from other possible uses because he is not the one performing the labor Miss Freed has no such illusions Embedded in context she knows that words never make things happen by themselvesor rather that the only things they can make happen are other abstractions like getting married or opening meetings They cant put marks onto paper They cant get letters in the mail They cant bring twentyfive people together at the right time and in the right place atthe Beekman Hotel in New York City where white tablecloths and black chalkboards await them For that material and em bodied processes must be usedprocesses that exist never in isolation but always in contexts where the relevant boundaries are permeable nego tiable instantiated On a level beyond words beyond theories and equations in her body and her arms and her fingers and her aching back Janet Freed knows that information is never disembodied that messages dont flow by themselves and that epistemology isnt a word floating through the thin thin air until it is connected up with incorporating practices  c h a p  e r  FO  Uf LIBERAL SUBJECTIVITY IMPERILED NORBERT WIENER AND CYBERNETIC ANXIETY Of all the implications that firstwave cybernetics conveyed perhaps none was more disturbing and potentially revolutionary than the idea that the boundaries of the human subject are constructed rather than given Con ceptualizing control communication and information as an integrated system cybernetics radically changed how boundaries were conceived Gregory Bateson brought the point home when he puzzled his graduate students with a question koanlike in its simplicity asking if a blind mans cane is part of the man 1 The question aimed to spark a mindshift Most of his students thought that human boundaries are naturally defined byepi dermal surfaces Seen from the cybernetic perspective coalescing into awareness during and after World War II however cybernetic systems are constituted by Hows of information In this viewpoint cane and man join in a Single system for the cane funnels to the man essential information about his environment The same is true of a hearing aid for a deaf person a voice synthesizer for someone with impaired speech and a helmet with a voice activated firing control for a fighter pilot This list is meant to be seductive for over the space of a comma it moves from modifications intended to compensate for deficiencies to inter ventions designed to enhance normal functioning Once this splice is passed establishing conceptual limits to the process becomes difficult In A Manifesto for Cyborgs Donna Haraway wrote about the potential of the cyborg to disrupt traditional categories 2 Fusing cybernetic device and biolOgical organism the cyborg violates the humanmachine distinction replacing cognition with neural feedback it challenges the humananimal difference explaining the behavior of thermostats and people through the ories of feedback hierarchical structure and control it erases the ani matelinanimate distinction In addition to arousing anxiety the cyborg can Liberal SubjecTiviTy Imperiled  also spark erotic fascination witness the female cyborg in Blade Runner The flip side of the cyborgs violation of boundaries is what Haraway calls its pleasurably tight coupling between parts that are not supposed to touch Mingling erotically charged violations with potent new fusions the cyborg becomes the stage on which are performed contestations about the body boundaries that have often marked class ethnic and cultural differences Especially when it operates in the realm of the Imaginary rather than through actual physical operations which act as a reality check on fantasies about cyborgism cybernetics intimates that body boundaries are up for grabs As George Lakoff and Mark Johnson have shown in their study of em bodied metaphors our images of our bodies their limitations and possi bilities openings and selfcontainments inform how we envision the intellectual territories we stake out and occupy 3 When the body is revealed as a constmct subject to radical change and redefinition bodies of know 1 edge are similarly apt to be seen as constmcts no more inevitable than the organic form that images them At the same time that cybernetics was re configuring the body as an informational system it was also presenting itself as a science of information that would remap intellectual terrains Branching out into diSCiplines as different as biology psychology and elec trical engineering it claimed to be a universal solvent that would dissolve traditional disCiplinary boundaries4 Norbeli Wiener the father of cyber netics could be supposed to endorse this imperialist ambition Yet con templating the penetration of cybernetics into social and humanistic fields he found himself confronted with some disturbing questions Where should the cybernetic dissolution of boundaries stop At what point does the anxiety provoked by dissolution overcome the ecstasy His writings tes tify to both the exhilaration and the uneasiness that cybernetics generated when its boundary dismptions threatened to get out of hand They illus trate the complex dynamiCS that marked the constmction of the cyborg during the foundational period of the late 1940s and 1950s As this brief summary suggests to engage Wieners work is to be stmck by contradiction Envisioning powerful new ways to equate humans and machines he also spoke up strongly for liberal humanist values A talk given to an audience of physiCians in 1954 illustrates the breadth of his concern and ambivalence  5 He predicted the existence of the automatic factory ar gued that electronic computers were thinking machines capable of taking over many human deCiSionmaking processes and cautioned that humans must not let machines become their masters As I indicated in chapter 1 the values ofliberal humanisma coherent rational self the right of that 86  Chapter Four self to autonomy and freedom and a sense of agency linked with a belief in enlightened selfinterestdeeply inform Wieners thinking Often these values stand him in good stead for example when he rejected the practice oflobotomy at a time when Lawrence Kubie along with many others was endorsing it During World War II he frantically immersed himself in militaryfunded research but after the war he announced his opposition to nuclear weapons and from then on refused to do military research6 The tension between Wieners humanistic values and the cybernetic viewpoint is everywhere apparent in his writing On the one hand he used cybernet ics to create more effective killing machines as Peter Galison has noted7 applying cybernetics to selfcorrecting radar tuning automated antiair craft fire torpedoes and guided missiles Yet he also struggled to envision the cybernetic machine in the image of a humanistic self Placed alongside his human brother sisters rarely enter this picture the cybernetic ma chine was to be deSigned so that it did not threaten the autonomous self regulating subject of liberal humanism On the contrary it was to extend that self into the realm of the machine But the confluence of cybernetics with liberal humanism was not to run so smoothly The parallel between selfregulating machinery and liberal humanism has a history that stretches back into the eighteenth century as Otto Mayr demonstrates in AuthOrity Liberty and Automatic Machinery in Early Modem Europe 8 Mayr argues that ideas about selfregulation were instrumental in effecting a shift from the centralized authoritarian control that characterized European political philosophy during the six teenth and seventeenth centuries especially in England France and Ger many to the Enlightenment philosophies of democracy decentralized control and liberal selfregulation Because systems were envisioned as selfregulating they could be left to work on their ownfrom the Invisible Hand of Adam Smiths selfregulating market to the political philosophy of enlightened selfinterest These visions of selfregulating economic and political systems produced a complementary notion of the liberal self as an autonomous selfregulating subject By the midtwentieth century liberal humanism selfregulating machinery and possessive individualism had come together in an uneasy alliance that at once helped to create the cyborg and also undermined the foundations ofliberal subjectivity Philip K Dick tapped into this potential instability when he used his fiction to pose a dis turbing question should a cybernetic machine sufficiently powerful in its selfregulating processes to become fully conscious and rational be al lowed to own itself9 If owning oneself was a constitutive premise for lib eral humanism the cyborg complicated that premise by its figuring of a Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  markets The inconsistencies in liberal philosophy that Dicks fiction exposes are also apparent in Wieners texts His writing indulges in many of the prac tices that have given liberalism a bad name among cultural critics the ten dency to use the plural to give voice to a privileged few while presuming to speak for everyone the masking of deep stmctural inequalities byenfran chiSing some while others remain excluded and the complicity of the speaker in capitalist imperialism a complicity that his rhetorical practices are deSigned to veil or obscure The closest that Wiener comes to a critique of these complicities is a rigid machine he constmcts in opposition to the cybernetic machine This alien and alienating machine is invested with qualities he wants to purge from cybernetics including rigidity oppres sion militaristic regulation of thought and action reduction of humans to antlike elements manipulation betrayal and death The scope of the cri tique is limited for it distances the negative values away from his projects instead of recognizing his complicity with them When he predicted the au tomatic factory for example he foresaw that it would result in largescale economic displacements with all the implications that this would have for workingclass people as autonomous independent agents but he offered no remedy other than the platitude that men must not let machines take over 10 Wiener was not unaware of the ironies through which cybernetics would imperil the very liberal humanist subject whose origins are enmeshed with selfregulating machinery Throughout his mature writings he stmggled to reconcile the tradition of liberalism with the new cybernetic paradigm he was in the process of creating When I think of him I imagine him labOring mightily to constmct the mirror of the cyborg He stands proudly before this product of his reflection urging us to look into it so that we can see our selves as controlcommunication devices differing in no substantial regard from our mechanical siblings Then he happens to glance over his shoulder sees himself as a cyborg and makes a horrified withdrawal What assump tions underlie this intense ambivalence What threads bind them together into something we might call a worldview How are the ambivalences ne gotiated and when do they become so intense that the only way to resolve them is to withdraw What can these complex negotiations tell us about the pleasures and dangers of the posthuman subjectivity that would soon dis place the liberal humanist self To explore these questions we will begin with Wieners early work on probability In his view it is because the world is fundamentally probabilis 88  Chapter Four tic that control is needed for the path of future events cannot be accurately predicted By the same token control cannot be static or centralized for then it would not be able to cope with unexpected developments The ne cessity for a flexible selfregulating system of control based on feedback from the system itself starts with the system thumbing its nose at N ewton ian predictability From this we will follow a web of sticky connections a reinscription of homeostasis an information construction that grows out of Wieners deep belief in a probabilistic universe an interpretation of noise linking noise with entropy degradation and death and above all an ana logical mode of thinking that moves eaSily across boundaries to identifY or construct pattern similarities between very different kinds of structures As much as anything it was these analogical moves that helped to construct the cyborg as Wiener envisioned it All this from a man so uncomfortable with his own body that he could not throw horseshoes in even approxi mately the right direction and had to abandon a career in biology because he was too clumsy to do the lab work These physical characteristics are not I shall argue entirely irrelevant to the cybernetic viewpoint that Wiener was instrumental in forging Of Molecules and Men Cybernetics and Probability Like Venus cybernetics was born from the froth of chaos Wieners impor tant early work was done on Brownian motion the random motion that molecules make as they collide with each other bounce off each other and collide again as if they were manic bumper cars 11 Given this chaos it is im possible to know the microstates in enough detail to predict from the laws of motion how individual molecules will behave Therefore probabilistic and statistical methods are required The Uncertainty Principle intro duced additional complications of a profound nature by setting limits on how precisely positions and momenta can be known Probability calcula tions are facilitated if one assumes that the chaotic motion is homogeneous that is that it is the same regardless of how the system is sliced to analyze it This leads to the famous ergodic hypothesis an ensemble of dynamiC sys tems in some way traces in the course of time a distribution of parameters which is identical with the distribution of parameters of all systems at a given time12 FollOwing George David Birkhoff Wiener helped to make this hypothesis more limited precise and mathematically rigorous than had Willard Gibbs when he first conceived the idea Refining Gibbss methods and ideas Wiener saw Gibbs as a seminal fig ure not only for his own work but for all of twentiethcentury science It Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  is  Gibbs rather than Einstein or Heisenberg or Planck to whom we must attribute the first great revolution of twentieth century physics Wiener wrote in The Human Use of Human Beings 13 Gibbs deserved this honor Wiener believed because he realized the deeper implications of probabil ity theory One explanation for this uncertainty is the limit placed on knowl edge by the Uncertainty PrinCiple mentioned above In addition to reflecting our ignorance of microstates uncertainty also stems from our finitude as human beings Thirty years before this became an important el ement in chaos theory Wiener shrewdly realized that initial conditions can never be known exactly because physical measurements are never com pletely preCise What we have to say about a machine or other dynamiC system really concerns not what we must expect when the initial positions and momenta are given with perfect accuracy which never occurs but what we are to expect when they are given with attainable accuracy HU p 8 Related to these epistemological issues is the shift of orientation implicit in Gibbss approach Rather than use probabilistic methods to address large numbers of particles like the bumper cars Gibbs used probability to consider how different initial velocities and positions might cause a system to evolve in different ways Thus he considered not many sets within one world but many worlds generated from a Single set or in Wieners phrase all the worlds which are possible answers to a limited set of questions con cerning our environment So important did Wiener consider this perspec tive that he argued It is with this point of view at its core that the new science of CybernetiCS began its development HU p 12 To see why Wiener considered the innovation profound we have only to compare it with Laplaces famous boast that given the initial conditions a being with enough computing power would be able to predict a systems evolution for eternity In this view the universe is completely deterministic and know able as preCise and predictable as a clock made by Godor amounting to the same thing for Laplace a clock governed by Newtons laws of motion By contrast the probabilistic world of Gibbs and Wiener operates like a baggy pair of pants holding together all right but constantly rearranging it self every time one tries to sit down Already steeped in probability theory and inclined to view the world as one evolution realized from a range of possible worlds Wiener thought about information in the same terms Working more or less independently of Leon Brillouin and Claude Shannon he came to similar conclusions 14 As we saw in chapter 3 Wiener defined information as a function of proba bilities representing a choice of one message from a range of possible mes 90  Chapter Four sages that might be sent In a sense he took Gibbss idea and substituted word for world Instead of one world coming into being from among a galaxy of possible worlds one message comes into being from a cacophony of possible messages When the theory worked Wiener took it as further confirmation that Gibbss approach expressed something fundamental about reality the word and the world are both essentially probabilistic in their natures This interpretation though fascinating as a window into Wieners view of the relation between information and physical reality se riously understates the constructive aspect of information theory Far from being a passive confirmation information theory was an active extension of a probabilistic worldview into the new and powerfully synthetic realm of communication theory We can now understand on a deeper level Wieners view of cybernetics as a universal theory of knowledge Such a universal perspective would succeed he thought because it reflects the way that weas finite imperfect creaturesknow the universe Statistical and quantum mechanics deal with uncertainty on the microscale communica tion reflects and embodies it on the macroscale Envisioning relations on the macroscale as acts of communication was thus tantamount to extending the reach of probability into the social world of agents and actors For us in the late age of information it may seem obvious that commu nication should be understood as requiring control and that control should be construed as a form of communication Underlying this construction however is a complex series of events with its own seriated history of engi neering problems material forms and bureaucratic structuresa history that James Beniger has written about so well in The Control Revolution Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society15 In broad outline the forms of control moved from mechanical a cam direct ing a mechanical rod to follow a certain path to thermodynamic a gover nor directing the action of a heat engine to informational cybernetic mechanisms of all kinds from computers to the hypothalamus understood in cybernetic terms In mechanical exchanges determinism and pre dictability loom large When the center of interest turns to the furnace with its fiery enactments of Brownian motion probability necessarily en ters the picture 16 When information comes to the fore probability moves from being ignorance of microstates to becoming a fundamental attribute of the communication act As each new form of exchange came to the fore the older ones did not disappear An automobile is essentially aheat engine but it nevertheless continues to use levers and rods of the kind known since the classical era Similarly a computer is an information machine but it also uses molecular processes governed by the laws of thermodynamics The Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  by a shift in the nature of their control mechanisms which in tum are de termined by the kinds of exchanges the machine is understood to transact The move toward cybernetic control theory is itself driven by feedback loops between theory and artifact research and researcher Envisioning different kinds of exchanges demanded different kinds of control mecha nisms and constructing new control mechanisms facilitated the con struction of more exchanges in that modeP The circularity among experimenter control mechanism and system interface is part of the story I want to tell This story includes not only the mechanisms of cybernetic systems but also the mindsets of those who constructed themselves and their machines in a cybernetic image Wieners assumptions as we have seen were rooted in a probabilistic worldview He realized that one of the subtle implications of this view is that messages are constituted measured and communicated not as thingsinthemselves but as relational differ ences between elements in a field Communication is about relation not essence Across the range of Wieners writing the rhetorical trope that figures most importantly is analogy Understanding communication as relation suggests a deeper reading of this figure Analogy is not merely an ornament of language but is a powerful conceptual mode that constitutes meaning through relation Seen in this way analogy is a crucial operator in every thing from Wieners passion for mathematics to his advocacy of black box engineering and behaviorist philosophy Indeed cybernetics as a diScipline could not have been created without analogy When analogy is used to con stitute agents in cybernetic discourse it makes an end run around ques tions of essence for objects are constructed through their relations to other objects Writing in the years immediately preceding and following World War II Wiener antiCipated some aspects of poststructuralist theories He questioned whether humans animals and machines have any essential qualities that exist in themselves apart from the web of relations that con stituted them in discursive and communicative fields Whatever view we have of the realities underlying our introspections and experiments and mathematical truths is quite secondary any proposition which cannot be translated into a statement concerning the observable is nugatory he wrote in 1936 in The Role of the Observer18 Wiener also saw sense per ception as working through analogy In his most extreme pronouncement on the matter he asserted Physics itself is merely a coherent way of de scribing the readings of physical instruments a statement deeply regret ted by his mathematical biographer Pesi Masani 19 Among the mappings in his view of the worldasanalogy were metaphors that overlaid mathe matics onto emotion sense perception onto communication and ma chines onto biological organisms These mappings throw a different light on his attempts to reconcile cybernetics with a liberal humanist subject If meaning is constituted through relation then juxtaposing men and ma chines goes beyond bringing two preexisting objects into harmonious rela tion Rather the analogical relation constitutes both terms through the process of articulating their relationship To see this meaningmaking in process let us tum now to a consideration of analogy in Wieners texts and practices Crossing Boundaries Everything Is an Analogy Including This Statement In his autobiography I Am a Mathematician Wiener tells of retreating to the family farm for a weekend after a row with a couple of inRuential Har vard mathematicians Coming home cold and wet he fell ill and slipped into delirium All through the pneumonia he wrote my delirium as sumed the form of a peculiar depression and worry about the row and  anxiety about the logical status of my mathematical work It was impossible for me to distinguish among my pain and difficulty in breathing the Rap ping of the window curtain and certain as yet unresolved parts of the mathematical potential problem on which I was working Retrospec tively musing on how his pain merged with external stimuli and mental ab straction he arrived at a key inSight about his relation to mathematics I cannot say merely that the pain revealed itself as a mathematical tension or that the mathematical tension symbolized itself as a pain for the two were united too closely to make such a separation significant He realized the possibility that almost any experience may act as a temporary symbol for a mathematical situation which has not yet been organized and cleared up IdentifYing an unsolved scientific problem with emotional conRict and physical pain he became more and more conscious that for him mathe matics served to reduce such a discord to semipermanent and recogniz able terms Once he solved the conceptual problem its link with a personal conRict seemed to resolve that as well allOwing him to release it and pass on to something else20 Mapping mathematics onto emotional conRicts is one way then that Wiener used analogy No doubt on more complex grounds than Jacob Bronowski intended he enthusiastically en dorsed Bronowskis suggestion that all of mathematics is a metaphor Math ematics Wiener wrote in The Human Use of Human Beings which most Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  of us see as the most factual of all sciences constitutes the most colossal metaphor imaginable and must be judged aesthetically as well as intellec tually in terms of the success of this metaphor RU p 95 His identification of personal conflicts with conceptual problems was so strong that he perceived it as driving him to mathematics almost as if against his will21 The coercive imagery is significant He was the son of a domineering father who conSCiously wanted to mold him into a prodigy Once out from under his fathers tutelage he often found it difficult to mo tivate himself Steve Heims in his biography of Wiener observes that Wiener apparently used the identification between emotional states and mathematical problems as a spur to goad himself onward 22 While working on a difficult problem he would fall into a depression which he would de liberately exacerbate to make himself work harder Relying on analogical equivalencies he set up between mathematics and emotion he anticipated that solving the intellectual problem would allow him to regain psycholog ical homeostasis The flip side of drawing analogies is constructing boundaries Analogy as a figure draws its force from the boundaries it leapfrogs across Without boundaries the links created by analogy would cease to have revolutionary impact For Wiener analogy and boundary work went hand in hand In both his professional and his private life he saw boundaries playing impor tant roles He included in his first autobiography ExProdigy My Child hood and Youth an account of his mothers antiSemitism and his feeling of being unwanted and alienated from her when he discovered as a teenager that his fathers side of the family was Jewish23 Perhaps because of this formative experience the construction of insideoutside markers charac terized his response to many life situations In his autobiographies he fre quently depicted himself as an outsider standing apart from a privileged group whose boundaries did not include him He made it a point to decline scientific prizes and to resign from prestigious profeSSional groups in which he was offered membership ifhe did not agree with their goals Boundaries also played important roles in his scientific work as they do in electrical engineering generally The problem that engaged him when he fell ill and felt the flapping curtain woven into the mathematics was a boundary problem having to do with what happens to an electrical field around a sharp physical discontinuity In his later work on cybernetics boundary formation and analogical linking collaborate to create a discur sive field in which animals humans and machines can be treated as equiv alent cybernetic systems The central text displaying this interplay is the influential cybernetic manifesto that Wiener coauthored in 1943 with 94  Chapter Four Julian Bigelow and Arturo Rosenblueth Behavior Purpose and Teleol ogy24 Offering an agenda for the nascent field of cybernetics this work also created a discursive style that produced the objects of its analysis Behavior Purpose and Teleology begins by contrasting behaviorism with functionalism Whereas functionalism in the authors definition foregrounds internal structure and is relatively unconcerned with the or ganisms relation to the environment behaviorism focuses on relations be tween the organism and environment and is relatively unconcerned with internal structure In the laboratory the behaviorist approach leads to black box engineering in which one assumes that the organism is a black box whose contents are unknown Producing equivalent behavior then counts as producing an equivalent system The obvious justification is that even when little or nothing is known about internal structure meaningful conclusions can still be drawn about behavior Bracketing internal struc ture did more than this however It also produced the assertion that because humans and machines sometimes behave similarly they are es sentially alike Note the slippage in this passage comparing living organ isms and machines The methods of study for the two groups are at present similar Whether they should always be the same may depend on whether or not there are one or more qualitatively distinct unique characteristics present in one group and absent in the other Such qualitative differences have not appeared so far p 22 Appeared is an apt choice of verb for the behaviorist viewpoint was constructed precisely to elide the very real differences existing between the internal structure of organisms and that of machines The analogy is produced by how the focus of attention is con structed The authors make a similar move when they perform successive cuts in the kinds of behavior they find interesting fOCUSing for example on purposeful rather than random behavior This series of boundary forma tions they contend reveals that a uniform behavioristic analysis is applic able to both machines and living organisms regardless of the complexity of the behavior p 22 What tends to drop from Sight is the fact that the equation between organism and machine works because it is seen from a position formulated precisely so that it will work Another rhetorical move is a reinscription of two important terms pur pose and teleology Each is carefully defined to fit the cybernetiC situation Purpose implies action directed toward a goal p 18 teleology implies a goal achieved through negative feedback In terms of the offered defini tions teleological behavior means simply behavior controlled by negative feedback p 24 But keeping a loaded term like teleology in play is not an innocent reinscription It carries with it the sense of moving toward a goal Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled I meaningful to the system pursuing that goal thus implying that meaning can exist for machines It also suggests thatthe behaviorist project has a cos molOgical dimension appropriate to the sweeping vistas of time and space that teleology is usually taken to imply The authors reinforce these implications when they point out that tele ology fell into scientific disrepute because it posits a final cause that exists in time after the effects it is supposed to bring about Their version of tele ology circumvents this problem it does not rely on Aristotelian causality of any kind but only on purposeful action toward a goal They suggest that the opposite of teleology is not deterministic causality but is nonteleology that is random behavior that is not goaldirected They thus shift onto new ground the centuriesold debate between Newtonian causality and Christ ian teleology The important tension now is not between science and God but between purpose and randomness Purpose achieved through negative feedback is the way that goalseeking devices deal with a probabilistic uni verse By implication the proper cosmological backdrop for the workings of teleolOgical mechanisms is neither the cosmos infused by divine purpose as imagined by Christians nor the world of infinite predictability as dreamed by Laplace but a Gibbesian universe of probabilistic relations and entropic decay Through these reinscriptions and analogical links cyber netics becomes philosophy by other means A young philosopher Richard Taylor took up the gauntlet thrown down in the cybernetic manifesto In a critique published seven years later in the same journal Philosophy of Science he sought to show that either pur pose had been stretched so far that it could apply to any behavior or else it had been used to smuggle in inferences that referred to a machines behav ior but that had properly originated within a human observer25 He in tended to demonstrate that the rhetoric of black box engineering had covertly opened the boxes and put into them qualities produced by the very analysis that treated them as unopened black boxes In their rebuttal Wiener and Rosenblueth make clear that they are ap pealing to a discourse community of scientists whom they deem superior to philosophers They constitute this community by distinguishing be tween verbal analysis which they call trivial and barren and their analy sis which is motivated by scientific concerns26 The implicit contrast between the verbal ambiguities that might interest a philosopher and the weighty concerns of science is underscored by the contrast they draw be tween TaylorS beliefs and their repeated use of science and scientific to describe their project eleven times in a short article Taylor had used several examples to illustrate that purpose as they defined it could be ap 96  Chapter Four plied to non teleological mechanisms a clock that breaks down at midnight on New Years Eve a submarine that follows a boat to which it is attached by a cable In riposte Wiener and Rosenblueth contend that these examples are easily distinguished from true servomechanisms using negative feed back To make the point however they are necessarily led into a discussion of the internal structures of the mechanismsexactly the position they did not want to take in their original article arguing for a behaviorist approach Their rebuttal is effective then only to the extent that it complements a strict behaviorist approach with an analysis that contra behaviorist princi ples uses differences in internal structures to sort behaviors into different categories This alternating focus on behavior and internal structure is similar to the rhetorical strategies that Geof Bowker analyzes in his article shOwing how cybernetics constituted itself as a universal science27 Bowker points out that cybernetics positioned itself both as a metascience and as a tool that any other science could use It offered a trans disciplinary vocabulary that could be adapted for a variety of diSciplinary purposes presenting itself in this guise as contentfree and it Simultaneously offered a contentrich practice in which cybernetic mechanisms were analyzed modeled and oc caSionally built Operating on these two different levels cybernetic dis course was able to penetrate into other diSciplines while also maintaining its turf as a disciplinary paradigm In Wiener and Rosenblueths rebuttal to Taylor the alternation between a structurefree and a structurerich cyber netics produces a similar rhetorical effect In its structurefree guise cy bernetics links men and machines by eliding internal structure in its structurerich form it presents information flow and negative feedback as important structural elements It is no accident that Warren McCulloch used a similar rhetorical strategy in his argument with Hans Teuber as dis cussed in chapter 3 Just as the alternation between contentfree and content rich cybernetics allows a deeper penetration into diSciplinary sites than would otherwise be possible so the alternation between behavior and structure allowed the discourse Simultaneously to assimilate biolOgical or ganisms and machines into the same category and to distinguish them from plainvanilla mechanical systems In his rejOinder Taylor missed the opportunity to point out thatthe focus of Wiener and Rosenblueths analysis alternated between behavior and structure28 Instead he chose to pursue a line of questioning similar to that in his Original article as he again tried to show that if one relies only on ex ternal observations of behavior purpose cannot be reliably distinguished from chance or random events In contesting for what counts as purpose Liberal Subjecrivirlj Imperiled  he wanted to deny to the behaviorist approach a distinction crucial to gen erating their system the difference between purposeful and random be havior He sensed that behavior had been defined so as to allow intention and desire to be imputed to machines But he let slip by the larger pOintthat behaviorist assumptions were used selectively to accomplish a political agenda implicit in the way that categories were constructed For Wiener this agenda included constituting one category that encompassed cyber netic machines and humans which were put together because they shared the ability to use probabilistic methods to control randomness and another category for noncybernetic mechanical systems These boundary markers implied larger assumptions about the nature of the universe probabilistic rather than deterministic about effective strategies for dealing with this universe controlling randomness through negative feedback and about a system hierarchy that had moral connotations as well as practical values flexible systems using negative feedback were better than mechanical de vices that did not use feedback More than the definition of purpose it was these larger inscriptions that made Behavior Purpose and Teleology the founding document for cybernetics One of the most frequent criticisms made of cybernetics during this pe riod was that it was not really a new science but was merely an extended analogy men are like machines Wiener heard the charge often enough that he finally felt it was time to take the cybernetic bull by the horns In The Nature of Analogy a manuscript fragment dated 1950 he offers a strong defense for analogy moving the argument onto new and more com pelling ground 29 Its brevity notwithstanding The Nature of Analogy is a wideranging meditation on what analogy means in science mathematics language and perception It argues that those who object to Wieners ana lOgical moves do so because they hold realist assumptions that do not stand up to rigorous scrutiny CybernetiCS as Wiener envisioned it is about rela tion not essence The analOgical relations it constructs are therefore not merely rhetorical figures but are systems that generate the only kind of sig nificance available to us as perceiving finite beings with no access to un mediated reality Wiener begins by pointing out that language is always analOgical in the sense that it puts forth propositions that listeners must interpret from their own experiences which are never identical to the speakers This observa tion anticipates Michael Arbib and Mary Hesses argument that significa tion occurs through category constitution not through the communication of an Aristotelian essence3D Like them Wiener also denies that language communicates an Aristotelian essence The convergence points to similar 98  Chapter Four ities between his definition of infomwtion and Ferdinand de Saussures view of la langue or language as a system In both cases communication proceeds through selection from a field of possible alternatives rather than through the direct articulation of inherent reference Just as Saussurian lin guistics is associated with deconstructive theories that reveal the indeter minacy of reference and that expose the inability of language to ground itself so Wieners cybernetics sees communication as a probabilistic act in a probabilistic universe where initial conditions are never known exactly and where messages signify only through their relation to other messages that might have been sent For Wiener no less than Saussure signification is about relation not about the world as a thinginitself 31 It is in this context that pattern associated with information as we saw in chapter 2 assumes paramount importance Wieners view of sense per ception makes the point clear Perception does not reflect reality directly but rather relies on transformations that preserve a pattern across multiple sensory modalities and neural interfaces Representation emerges through the analogical relation of these transformations to the original stimulus In this respect sense perception is like mathematics and logic for they too deal preeminently with pattern apart from content32 The behaviorist approach is well suited to this relational epistemology because it concen trates on transmission of patterns rather than communication of essence Consider the antiaircraft predictor that Wiener developed in collaboration with Julian Bigelow during World War II33 The prognosticator received tracking data as input for example radar follOwing a plane and gave as output predictions of where the plane would go Statistical analysis was used to find patterns in these data and the data themselves were under stood as patterns analogically related to events in the world Thus percep tion mathematics and information all concentrate on pattern rather than content As data move across various kinds of interfaces analogical rela tionships are the links that allow pattern to be preserved from one modality to another Analogy is thus constituted as a universal exchange system that allows data to move across boundaries It is the lingua franca of a world re constructed through relation rather than grasped in essence Border crossings accomplished through analogy include the separation between flesh and world sense perception the transition between one dis Cipline and another for example moving from the phYSiology of living or ganisms to the electrical engineering of a cybernetic machine and the transformation of embodied experience noisy with error into the clean abstractions of mathematical pattern Even the prostheses that Wiener de Signed can be understood as operating through analogy for they trans Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  formed information from one modality into another34 The hearing glove for example was an apparatus that converted sounds auditory signals into touch tactile signals by stimulating a deaf persons fingers with electro magnetic vibrators that were analogical transformations of sound frequen cies For Wiener analogy was communication and communication was analogy Objecting that cybernetics is merely an analogy was for him akin to saying that cybernetics is merely about how we know the world The problem with this approach lies not so much in the analogical rela tions that Wiener constructed between living and mechanical systems as in his tendency to erase from view the very real differences in embodied ma teriality differences that the analogies did not express Confronted with two situations he was much more inclined to move easily and quickly to an abstract level where similarities in patterns became evident than to re main attentive to the particularities that made each situation unique No doubt his own lack of involvement in the nittygritty work of the lab was a contributing factor in this elision of embodied materiality He noted the impatience he felt with the exacting procedures of the biologicallabo ratory This impatience was largely the result of my mental quickness and physical slowness I could see the end to be accomplished long be fore I could labor through the manipulative stages that were to bring me there35 The problem was serious enough to force him to give up his hope of earning a PhD in biology In his later profeSSional collaborations with Rosenblueth and others he left the lab work to them Colleagues recall how he would wander into Rosenblueths laboratory when an experiment was under way make a few  Chapter Four As we have seen Wiener wanted to inscribe cybernetics into a larger drama that would reinforce the liberal humanist subject Given his inclina tion toward a Gibbesian universe that drama focused on probability In addition to operating on the microscale of subatomic particles and the macroscale of cybernetic circuits probability also operates on the cosmo lOgical level of universal dissipation and decay Linking probability with in formation allowed Wiener to script the cybernetic subject into a cosmological drama of chaos and order It is here on this cosmological level that he staged the moral distinctions between good cybernetic sys tems which reinforce the autonomous liberal subject and evil machines which undermine or destroy the autonomy of the subject An important player in this titanic struggle between good and evil machines is entropy a protean concept with a richly complex history Entropy as Cultural Relay From Heat Engines to Information We can begin our investigation into entropy with the series of transforma tions that Mark Seltzer traces in Bodies and Machines Seltzer concentrating on the social formations oflatenineteenthcentury naturalism finds at the heart of naturalism a double and seemingly contradictory thrust on the one hand the insistence on the materiality or physicality of persons represen tations and actions on the other hand the insistent abstraction of persons bodies and motions to models numbers maps charts and diagrammatic representations Calling the ideology that resulted from this double thrust a dematerialized materialism Seltzer instances such phenomena as the emergence of statistical representations for human behavior and the re newed interest in the ergonomics of the human body38 One focuses on be havior abstracted into statistical ensembles of data the other on the material processes of energy consumption and dissipation They illustrate the con struction of bodies both as material objects and as probability distributions The duality that Seltzer locates in nineteenthcentury culture continued into the twentieth century with renewed force when statistical thermody namics merged with information theory One of the principal sites for this merger was cybernetics The emphasis on pattern constructed bodies as im material flows of information the alternating emphasis on structure rec ognized that these black boxes were heavy with materiality Complex couplings between the two registers worked to set up a series of exchanges between biological organisms and machines To see how these couplings evolved let us start with the exchanges that thermodynamiCS set up and fol low them forward into cybernetiCS Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled I The first law of thermodynamics stating that energy is neither created nor destroyed points to a world in which no energy is lost The second law stating that entropy always tends to increase in a closed system forecasts a universe that is constantly winding down This tension between the first and second laws between stability and degradation runs like a leitmotiv through turnofthecenturycultural formations According to Seltzer the tension itself acts like a thermodynamic exchanger allOwing incompatible terms such as production and reproduction machines and bodies to be ar ticulated together The body is like a heat engine because it cycles energy into different forms and degrades it in the process the body is not like a heat engine because it can use energy to repair itself and to reproduce In one sense the comparison constructs the difference between body and ma chine in another sense it acts as an exchanger that allows bodies and heat engines to be linked together Through such comparisons Seltzer argues what is gradually elaborated is a more or less efficient more or less effec tive system of transformations and relays between opposed and contra dictory registers These ambiguous linkages were reinforced because thermodynamics itself was perceived as operating in the two different reg isters of conservation and dissipation Thus he concludes that thermody namics wrapping both conservative stability and dissipative decay within the mantle of scientific authority provided a working model of a new me chanics and biomechanics of power 39 Already functioning as an exchange system within the culture ther modynamiCS evolved into dematerialized materialism when Ludwig Boltzmann gave entropy a much more general formulation by defining it as a probability function In this dematerialized construction entropy was interpreted as a measure of randomness The second law was then refor mulated to state that closed systems tend to move from order to random ness Encompassing the earlier definition of entropy Boltzmanns formulation also added something new for it allowed entropy to be linked with systems that had nothing to do with heat engines This dematerialization was carried further when entropy was connected with information As early as 1929 the connection was made through Leo Szilards interpretation of Maxwells Demon4o a mythical being in a thought experiment proposed by James Clerk Maxwell in 1871 The De mon gained energy by sorting molecules Szilard and Leon Brillouin among others pointed out that to sort molecules the Demon has to have information about them41 The container in which the Demon sits is imagined as a black body a technical term meaning that the radiation is uniformly dispersed so that there is no way for the Demon to see the 102  Chapter Four molecules Brillouin calculated that the energy the Demon would have to expend to get information about the molecules is greater than what the Demon could gain by the sorting process The immediate result was to res cue the second law which in any case was too wellestablished to be seri ously in doubt The more important implication was to suggest that entropy and information are inversely related to each other The more information there is the less entropy the more entropy is present the less information Brillouin therefore proposed that information be considered as negative entropy or negentropy Maxwells Demon was one of the relay points through which a relationship was established between entropy and infor mation Like Brillouin and many others of his generation Wiener accepted the idea that entropy was the opposite of information The inverse relation made sense to him because he thought of information as allied with struc ture and viewed entropy as associated with randomness dissipation and death As entropy increases he wrote the universe and all closed sys tems in the universe tend naturally to deteriorate and lose their distinc tiveness to move from the least to the most probable state from a state of organization and differentiation in which distinctions and forms exist to a state of chaos and sameness In Gibbs universe order is least probable chaos most probable In this view life is an island of negentropy amid a sea of disorder There are local enclaves whose direction seems opposed to that of the universe at large and in which there is a limited and temporary tendency for organization to increase Life finds its home in some of these enclaves HU p 12 In a related metaphor he envisioned a living organ ism as an informational system swimming upstream against the entropic tide This view of entropy makes sense when viewed in the context of nineteenthcentury thermodynamics But it is not a necessary implication of information as information is technically defined Claude Shannon took the opposite view and identified information and entropy rather than op posed them42 Since the choice of sign was conventional this formulation was also a possibility HeUristically Shannons choice was explained by say ing that the more unexpected or random a message is the more informa tion it conveys43 This change in sign did not affect the dematerialization that entropy had undergone but it did reverse entropys value in more than a mathematical sense In retrospect identifYing entropy with information can be seen as a crucial crossing point for this allowed entropy to be recon ceptualized as the thermodynamic motor driving systems to selforganiza tion rather than as the heat engine driving the world to universal heat death Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled I Space will not permit me to tell the story of this reversal here and in any event it has been chronicled elsewhere44 Suffice it to say that as a result chaos went from being associated with dissipation in the Victorian sense of dissolute living and reckless waste to being associated with diSSipation in a newly positive sense of increasing complexity and new life Wiener came close to making this crossing In one of his astonishing ana lOgical leaps he saw a connection between the light that the Demon needs to sort the molecules and the lights that plants use in photosynthesis He argued that in photosynthesis plants act as if their leaves were studded with Maxwells Demons all sorting molecules to allow the plant to run up hill toward increasing complexity rather than downhill toward death 45 But he did not go beyond this isolated insight to the larger realization that large entropy production could drive systems to increasing complexity Finally he remains on the negative side of this divide seeing life and homeostasis as contrarian islands that although they may hold out for a while must even tually be swamped by the entropic tide So firmly rooted is Wiener in this perspective that he comes close on sev eral occasions to saying that entropic decay is evil Entropy becomes morally negative for Wiener when he sees it operating against the differen tial probability distributions on which the transfer of information depends Recall that Gregory Bateson defined information as a difference that makes a difference if there is no difference there is no information Since entropy tends always to increase it will eventually result in a universe in which all distributions are in their most probable state and in which univer sal homogeneity prevails Imagine Dr Zhivago sitting at his desk in a cold cold room trying to telegraph a message to his beloved Laura while in the background Lauras theme plays and entropy keeps relentlessly increasing Icicles hanging from his fingers and the telegraph key he tries to tap out I love you but he is having trouble He not only is freezing from heat death but also is styn1ied by information death No matter what he taps the mes sage always comes outthe same eeeeeee orwhatever letter is most com mon in the Russian alphabet This whimsical scenario illustrates why Wiener associated entropy with oppression rigidity and death Communi cation can be seen he suggested as a game that two humans or machines play against noise46 To be rigid is inevitably to lose the game for rigidity consigns the players to the mechanical repetition of messages that can only erode over time as noise intervenes Only if creative play is allowed if the mechanism can adapt freely to changing messages can homeostasis be maintained even temporarily in the face of constant entropic pressure to ward degradation 04  Chapter Four In the dematerialized materialism of the battlefield where life strug gles against entropy and noise the body ceases to be regarded primarily as a material object and instead is seen as an informational pattern The struggle then is between strategists who try to preserve this pattern intact and noisy opponents or rather noise as an opponent who try to disrupt it During the 1940s and 1950s Wiener was one of the important voices casting the cos mological drama between cybernetic mechanisms and noise in these terms In The Human Use of Human Beings he suggests that human beings are not so much bone and blood nerve and synapse as they are patterns of organi zation He points out that over the course of a lifetime the cells composing a human being change many times over Identity cannot therefore consist in physical continuity Our tissues change as we live the food we eat and the air we breathe become flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone and the mo mentary elements of our flesh and bone pass out of our body every day with our excreta We are but whirlpools in a river of everflowing water We are not stuff that abides but patterns that perpetuate themselves HU p 96 Consequently to understand humans one needs to understand how the patterns of information they embody are created organized stored and re trieved Once these mechanisms are understood they can be used to create cybernetic machines If memory in humans is the transfer of informational patterns from the environment to the brain machines can be built to effect the same kind of transfer Even emotions may be achievable for machines if feelings are considered not as merely a useless epiphenomenon of nervous actions HU p 72 but as control mechanisms governing learning47 Con sidered as informational patterns cybernetic machines and men can make common cause against the disruptive forces of noise and entropy The picture that emerges from these conjectures shows the cybernetic organismhuman or mechanicalresponding flexibly to changing situa tions learning from the past freely adapting its behavior to meet new cir cumstances and succeeding in preserving homeostatic stability in the midst of even radically altered environments Nimbleness is an essential weapon in this struggle for to repeat mindlessly and mechanically is in evitably to let noise win Noise has the best chance against rote repetition where it goes to work at once to introduce randomness But a system that already behaves unpredictably cannot be so easily subverted If a Gibbe sian universe implies eventual information death it also implies a universe in which the best shot for success lies in flexible and probabilistic behavior The Greek root for cybernetics steersman aptly describes the cyber netic manmachine light on its feet sensitive to change a being that both is a flow and knows how to go with the flow Liberal Subjectivitl Imperiled I distinctions Wiener makes between good and bad machines When ma chines are evil in The Human Use of Human Beings it is usually because they have become rigid and inflexible Whereas the cybernetic machine is ranged alongside man as his brother and peer metaphors that cluster around the rigid machine depict it through tropes of domination and en gulfment The ultimate horror is for the rigid machine to absorb the human being coopting the flexibility that is the human birthright When human atoms are knit into an organization in which they are used not in their full right as responsible human beings but as cogs and levers and rods it mat ters little that their raw material is flesh and blood What is used as an ele mentinamachine is in fact an element in the machine HU p185 Here the analogical mapping between humans and machines turns sinister trap ping humans within inflexible walls that rob them of their autonomy The passage shows how important it is to Wiener to construct the boundaries of the cybernetic machine so that it reinforces rather than threatens the au tonomous self When the boundaries tum ri6rid or engulf humans so that they lose their agency the machine ceases to be cybernetic and becomes Simply and oppressively mechanical The cosmological stage upon which the struggle between oppressive machines and cybernetic systems unfolds isno surprisethe Gibbesian universe in which probability reigns supreme The great weakness of the machinethe weakness that saves us so far from being dominated by it is that it cannot yet take into account the vast range of probability that char acterizes the human situation Here the probability differentials that make communication possible are assimilated to humans and good ma chines leaving bad machines to flounder around in probabilities too di verse for them to assess The rules of the contest are laid down by the second law of thermodynamics which allows a margin in which cybernetic menmachines can operate because it is still cranking up its death engine The dominance of the machine presupposes a society in the last stages of increasing entropy where probability is negligible and where the statistical differences among individuals are nil Fortunately we have not yet reached such a state HU p 181 When in the end the universe ceases to manifest diverse probabilities and becomes a uniform soup control communica tion cyberneticsnot to mention lifewill expire In the meantime men and cybernetic machines stand shoulder to shoulder in building dikes that temporarily stave off the entropic tide The boundary work that links cybernetic machines and humans perhaps between Augustinian and Manichean opponents At issue in this distinc tion is the difference between an opponent who plays honorably that is abiding by rules that do not change and one who tries to win by manipu lation For Wiener the exemplar of an Augustinian opponent is nature N a tureincluding noisemay sometimes frustrate the scientists attempt to control it but it does not consciously try to manipulate its opponent The exemplar of the Manichean opponent is the chess player including chess playing machines Unlike nature the chess player acts deviously and if possible manipulatively When the chess player is contrasted with the sci entist it is almost always to the chess playerS detriment In pointing out that nature does not try to outwit the scientist Wiener observes that having an Augustinian opponent means that the scientist has time to reHect on and correct his or her strategy because no one is trying to take advantage of the scientists mistakes Scientists are thus governed by their best moments whereas chess players are governed by their worst HU p 36 Peter Galison in The Ontology of the Enemy Norbert Wiener and the Cybernetic Vision argues that cybernetics along with game theory and operations research should be called a Manichean science48 In a fine grained analysis of Wieners collaboration with Julian Bigelow to develop an antiaircraft AA weapon during World War II Galison brilliantly shows that Wieners construction of the enemy was significantly different from that portrayed in war propaganda or even in other technical reports Rather than seeing the enemy in conventionally human or in the case of propa ganda subhuman terms Wiener modeled the enemyfor example a fighter pilot trying to evade AA fireas a probabilistic system that could ef fectively be countered using cybernetic modeling Unlike other fire sys tems which had fixed rules derived from probabilistic modeling Wieners imagined firing machine could evolve new rules based on prior observa tionthat is it could learn Thus the firing system would evolve to become as Manichean as the enemy it faced Galison argues that this strategy en abled a series of substitutions and identifications that mapped the enemy pilot onto the servocontroller and ultimately onto the allied war personnel behind the servocontroller In a Summary Report for Demonstration Wiener and Bigelow wrote We realized that the randomness or irregu larity of an airplanes path is introduced by the pilot that in attempting to force his dynamic craft to execute a useful manoeuvere  the pilot be haves like a servomechanism quoted in Galison p 236 Thus cybernet ics itself constituted through analogies creates further analogies through Liberal Subiectivity Imperiled  07 theories and artifacts that splice man to machine German to American Through this relay system the enemy becomes like us and we become like the enemy enemy mine If these analogical mappings kept the enemy pilot from being demonized they also made the cybernetic machine and byex tension cybernetics itself party to a bloody struggle in which Manichean tactics were used by both sides to kill as many humans as pOSSible Partly in reaction to this cooptation of cybernetics by the military Wiener half a decade after the war wrote the Significantly entitled The Hu man Use of Human Beings 49 Although Wiener had done everything in his power during the war to further cybernetics as a Manichean science his writings after the war show a deep aversion to the manipulation that a Manichean strategy implies From his autobiographies it is clear that he was hypersensitive to being manipulated perhaps with good reason When he was first beginning to establish himself as a mathematician his father tried to get him to use his contacts to advance his fathers philological ideasan instance of manipulation that made Wiener increasingly wary of how others might try to use his talents and influence to further their owu ends It is no accident that he associated the manipulative chessplaying machine with the military projects that he resolutely turned away from af ter atomic bombs vaporized hundreds of thousands ofJapanese civilians Remarking on Claude Shannons suggestion that chessplaying machines have military potential he wrote When Mr Shannon speaks of the devel opment of military tactics he is not talking moonshine but is discussing a most imminent and dangerous contingency HU p 178 The problem of course was that cybernetics adapted all too readily to Manichean tactics making it possible to play these deadly games even more effectively Vieners war work combined with his antimilitary stance after the war illustrates with startling clarity how cybernetics functioned as a source of both intense pride and intense anxiety for him This tension often ex pressed as an anxious desire to limit the scope of cybernetics takes a differ ent but related form when he considers the question of body boundaries always a highly charged issue When the physical boundaries of the human form are secure he celebrates the flow of information through the organ ism All this changes however when the boundaries cease to define an au tonomous self either through manipulation or engulfment In the next section we vill see how this anxiety erupts into his 1948 book Cybernetics at critical pOints causing him to withdraw from the more subversive impli cations of the diSCipline he fathered It is no accident that erotic metaphors are used to carry the thrust of the argument Like cybernetics eroticism is intensely concerned with the problematics of body boundaries It is not for nothing that sexual orgasm is called the little death or that writers from Marquis de Sade to J G Ballard have obsessively associated eroticism with penetrating and opening the body At stake in the erotically charged dis course in which Wiener considers the pleasures and dangers of coupling between parts that are not supposed to touch is how extensively the body of the subject may be penetrated or even dissolved by cybernetics as a body of knowledge It is here as much as anywhere else that Wieners concern to preserve the liberal subject comes into uneasy tension with his equally strong desire to advance the cause of cybernetics As we shall see resolu tion can be achieved only by withdrawal pointing toward a future in which the cybernetic subject could not finally be contained within the assump tions ofliberal humanism The Argument for Celibacy Preserving the Boundaries of the Subject In Cybernetics the technical text from which The Human Use of Human Beings was adapted Wiener looks into the mirror of the cyborg but then withdraws50 The scenarios he constructs to enact and justifY this with drawal suggestively point to the role that erotic anxiety plays in cybernetic narratives In my analYSiS I will focus on the chapter entitled Information Language and Society Here Wiener entertains the possibility that cyber netics has provided a way of thinking so fertile that it will allow the social and natural sciences to be synthesized into one great field ofinquiry Yet he finally demurs from this palpable object of desire Given that he is as impe rialistic as most other scientists who think they have invented a new para digm why does he prefer to maintain the intellectual celibacy of his discovery I will argue that central to his decision is a fantasy scene that ex presses and controls anxiety by reconstituting boundaries This fantasy gives rise to a series of erotically encoded metaphors that appear whenever anxiety becomes acute The metaphors also have literal meanings that re veal how intermingled the physical remains with the conceptual the erotic with the cybernetic As gestures of separation disconcertingly transform into couplings the cybernetics of the subject and the subject of cybernetics interpenetrate Wiener works up to the fantasy by pointing out that there are many or ganizations whose parts are themselves small organizations Hobbess Leviathan is a ManState made up of men a Portuguese manofwar is composed of polyps that mirror it in miniature a man is an organism made Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  up of cells that in some respects also function like organisms This line of thought leads Wiener to ask how these bodies politic function Obvi ously the secret is in the intercommunication of its members The flow of information is thus introduced as a principle explaining how organization occurs across multiple hierarchical levels To illustrate he instances the sexually attractive substances that various species secrete to ensure that the sexes will be brought together HU p 156 For example the phero mones that guide insect reproduction are general and omnidirectional act ing in this respect like hormones secreted within the body The analogy suggests that external hormones organize internal hormones so that a hu man organism becomes in effect a sort of permeable membrane through which hormonal information flows At this point we encounter his first de murral I do not care to pronounce an opinion on this matter he an nounces rather pretentiously after introducing it preferring to leave it as an interesting idea HU p 157 I think that the idea is left because it is disturbing as well as speculative It implies that personal identity and autonomous will are merely illusions that mask the cybernetic reality If our body surfaces are membranes through which information flows who are we Are we the cells that re spond to the stimuli Are we the larger collectives whose actions are the re sultant of the individual members Or are we the host organisms who as Richard Dawkins later claimed using cybernetic arguments engage in sex because we are controlled by selfish genes within51 The choice of ex amples foregrounds sexuality but this is a kind of sex without sexuality Im plying the deconstruction of the autonomous self as a locus of erotic pleasure it circumvents the assenting demurring intenSifYing delaying and consummating that constitute sexual play When Wiener is confronted with this sexless sex his first impulse is to withdraw coitus interruptus His second impulse is to reconstruct himself as a liberal subject through a disguised erotic fantasy that allows him to control the flow of information rather than be controlled by it Similar fantasies appear everywhere in American literature from Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook to Ishmael and Queequeg They are ubiquitous because they are about the American values of masculine autonomy and control about deferred intimacy be tween men in a society that is homophobic racist and misogynist What is this fantasy What else but for the American male to imagine himself alone in the woods with an intelligent savage giving himself over to the pursuits that men follow when they are alone together HU p 157 The fantasys ostensible purpose is to show that Wiener and his savage companion could achieve intimacy even if they did not touch and shared no  Chapter Four language Wiener imagines himselfalert to those moments when the sav age shows the signs of emotion or interest noticing at these moments what he watches After a time the savage would learn to reciprocate by picking out the moments of my special active attention thus creating between them a language as varied in possibilities as the range of impres sions that the two of us are able to encompass HU p 157 Alone together in the woods the two men construct a world of objects through the inter play of their gazes In the process they also reconstitute themselves as autonomous subjects who achieve intimacy through their voyeuristic par ticipation in each others emotion and special active attention There re mains of course a necessary difference between them Wiener can move from this fantasy to the rest of his argument whereas the intelligent sav age reappears in his discourse only when Wiener finds it convenient to in voke the savage The passage reveals in miniature how the use of the plural by the liberal humanist subject can appropriate the voices of subaltern oth ers who if they could speak for themselves might say something very dif ferent Having reassured himself of intimacy autonomy and control Wiener returns to the problem of the body politic concentrating on its alarming lack of homeostasis In contrast to the regulated orderly exchanges be tween him and his savage friend the body politic is dominated by ex changes between knaves and fools with betrayal turncoatism and deception the order of the day HU p 59 The economy of this society is clearcut the fools desire the knaves manipulate their desires The econ omy is reinforced by statisticians SOciolOgists and economists who prosti tute themselves by figuring out for the knaves exactly how the calculus of desire can be maximized The only respite from this relentless manipula tion is found in small autonomous populations There homeostasis can still work whether in highly literate communities  or villages of primitive savages HU p 160 The reappearance of the savage here is Significant for anxiety about the manipulation of desire is reaching its height No doubt this reappearance has a soothing effect on Wieners imagination for it re minds him that he need not be manipulated after all We come now to the crux of the argument The danger of cybernetics from Wieners point of view is that it can potentially annihilate the liberal subject as the locus of control On the microscale the individual is merely the container for still smaller units within units that dictate actions and de sires on the macroscale these desires make the individual into a fool to be manipulated by knaves Under a cybernetic paradigm these two scales of organization would be joined to each other What chance then for intimate Liberal Subjecriviry Imperiled  11 communication alone with an intelligent savage in the woods No despite the hopes which some  friends have built for the social efficacy of what ever new ways of thinking this book may contain Wiener finds himself unable to attribute too much value to this type of wishful thinking HU p 162 Ironically expanded too far across the bodies of disciplines the science of control might rob its progenitor of the very control that was no doubt for him one of its most attractive features Having reached this conclusion Wiener reenacts the anxiety that gave rise to it Through a series of interactive metaphors that connect his fantasy with his anxiety he claims that it is a misunderstanding of the nature of all scientific achievement to suppose that the physical and social sciences can be jOined HU p 162 They must be kept apart for they permit dif ferent degrees of coupling between the scientist and the object of his inter est The precise sciences achieve a suffiCiently loose coupling with the phenomena we are studying to allow us 1 to give a massive total account of this coupling Erotic interest is not altogether lacking for the coupling may not be loose enough for us to be able to ignore it altogether HU p 163 Nevertheless the restrained science that Wiener practices is dif ferent from the social sciences where the coupling is much tighter and more intense The contrast shows how central the concept of the autono mous self is to cybernetics as Wiener envisioned it The savage makes one last appearance in Wieners anxious considera tion of how tightly the scientist can be coupled with his object without los ing his objectivity To illustrate the dangers of tight coupling Wiener observes that primitive societies are very often changed by the anthropolo gists who observe them He makes the point specifically in terms of lan guage Many a missionary has fixed his own misunderstandings of a primitive language as law eternal in the process of reducing it to writing HU p 63 In implicit contrast to this violation is the pristine intimacy Wiener achieved with his savage where no misunderstandings disrupted the perfect sympathy of their gazes Concluding that we are too much in tune iith the objects of our inves tigations to be good probes Wiener counsels that cybernetics had best be left to the physical sciences for to carry it into the human sciences would only build exaggerated expectations HU p 164 Behind this conclusion is the prospect of an interpenetration so complete that it would link the lit tle units within to the larger social units without thereby reducing the indi vidual to a connective membrane with no control over desires and with no ability to derive pleasure from them Not only sex but the sex organs them selves disappear in this construction Thus Wiener decides that however might be cybernetics is better off remaining celibate The conjunction of erotic anxiety and intellectual speculation in Wieners text implies that cybernetics cannot be adequately understood simply as a theoretic and technological extension of information theory The analogies so important to his thought are constituted not only through similarities between abstract forms such as probability ratios and statisti cal analysis but also through the complex lifeworld of embedded physical ity that natural language expresses and evokes through its metaphoric resonances Natural language is not extraneous to understanding the full complexities of Wieners thinking as his mathematical biographer Pesi Masani implies when Masani contrasts the disembodied abstractions of mathematics with the longwinded verbosity of natural language the hallmark of bureaucratic chicanery and fake labor52 On the contrary the embodied metaphors oflanguage are crucial to understanding the ways in which Wieners construction of the cybernetic body and the body of cyber netics both privilege and imperil the autonomous humanistic subject Viewed in historical perspective Wiener was not successful in contain ing cybernetics within the circle ofliberal humanist assumptions Only for a relatively brief period in the late 1940s and 1950s could the dynamic ten sion between cybernetics and the liberal subject be maintaineduneasy and anxious as that accommodation often was for Wiener By the 1960s the link between liberal humanism and selfregulation a link forged in the eighteenth century was already stretched thin by the 1980s it was largely broken It is to Wieners credit that he tried to craft a version of cybernetics that would enhance rather than subvert human freedom But no person even the father of a discipline can singlehandedly control what cybernet ics signifies when it propagates through the culture by all manner of promiscuous couplings Even as cybernetics lost the momentum of its drive to be a universal science its enabling premises were mutating and re producing at other sites The voices that speak the cyborg do not speak as one and the stories they tell are very different from the narratives that Wiener struggled to authorize FROM HYPHEN TO SPLICE CYBERNETIC SYNTAX IN LIMBO In Bernard Wolfes Limbo the 1952 novel that has become an under ground classic anxiety about boundaries becomes acute Like Norbert Wiener by whom he was deeply influenced Wolfe recognized the revolu tionarypotential of cybernetics to reconfigure bodies Also like Wiener he tried unsuccessfully to contain that potential fearing that if it went too far it could threaten the autonomy of the male liberal subject Abrasive outra geous transgressive frustratingly misogynistic and occasionally brilliant Limbo rarely leaves its readers feeling neutral David Samuelson ranks it with Brave New World and 1984 as one of the three great dystopian novels of the centuryl At the other end of the spectrum are readers including some of my students who see it as remarkable mostly for its egregious sex ism and tendentious argument Whatever ones view of Limbos literary value it is clear that the text is powerfully marked by the tum to a postWorld War II cybernetic economy of information and simulacra Limbo arrived at a pivotal moment in US history at a time when changes in speed and communication were forcing technologies of control into a reorganization that would result in the computer revolution and when the cold war loomed large in the national consciousness It was in this climate that cybernetics was beginning to change what counted as hu man As we saw in preceding chapters cybernetics constructed humans as information processing systems whose boundaries are determined by the flow of information Cybernetics problematized body boundaries at the same time that the culture was generally anxious about communist pene trations into the body politic The time was right for a text that would over lay the cybernetic reconfiguration of the human body onto the US geopolitical body and given Wolfes misogynistic views onto the contested terrain of the gendered body Limbo creates that imaginary geography and  Chapter Five imbues it with the hypnagogic force of a nightmare As a novel of ideas it displays some of the passageways through which cybernetic notions began to circulate throughout US culture and connect up with contemporary political anxieties As a novel of ideas it is an important literary document because it stages encounters between literary form and bodies represented within the text The textual corpus no less than the represented world bears the imprint of the cybernetic paradigm upon its body War acknowledged and covert is the repressed trauma that threatens to erupt throughout Limbo But this is war transfigured so compounded with neocortical forays and cybernetic refashionings that the terrains on which it is fought include synapses and circuits as well as checkpoints and borders Although the novel is set in 1990 Wolfe asserts in an afterword Anybody who paints a picture of some coming year is kiddinghes only fanCying up something in the present or past not blueprinting the future All such writing is essentially satiric todaycentered not utopic tomorrow centered 2 His insistence on the novels satiric intent is a useful reminder that Limbo refracts its cybernetics concerns through the hysterical denun ciations and national delirium precipitated by the cold war In Pure War Paul Virilio argues that postmodern technologies especially global infor mation networks and supersonic transport have changed how military or ganizations conceptualize the enemy3 Whereas a countrys borders were previously presumed adequate to distinguish between citizen and alien in the postWorld War II period the distinction between inside and outside ceased to SignifY in the same way The military no longer thought of its task as protecting the body politic against an exterior enemy Rather military re From Hyphen to Splice  nological practice it could be confined to such technical fields as bionics medical prostheses and virtual reality Manifesting itself as both techno lOgical object and discursive formation it partakes of the power of the imagination as well as of the actuality of technology Cyborgs actually exist About 10 percent of the current US population are estimated to be cyborgs in the technical sense including people with electronic pacemak ers artificial joints drugimplant systems implanted corneal lenses and artificial skin A much higher percentage participates in occupations that make them into metaphoric cyborgs including the computer keyboarder joined in a cybernetic circuit with the screen the neurosurgeon guided by fiberoptic microscopy during an operation and the adolescent game player in the local videogame arcade Terminal identity Scott Bukatman has named this condition calling it an unmistakably doubled articulation that Signals the end of traditional concepts of identity even as it points to ward the cybernetiC loop that generates a new kind of subjectivity 6 Limbo edges uneasily toward this subjectivity and then only with signif icant reservations Instead of a circuit it envisions polarities joined by a hyphen humanmachine malefemale textmarginalia The difference between hyphen and circuit lies in the tightness of the coupling recall Wieners argument about the virtues ofloose coupling and in the degree to which the hyphenated subject is transfigured after becoming a cybernetic entity Whereas the hyphen joins opposites in a metonymic tension that can be seen as maintaining the identity of each the circuit implies a more reflexive and trans formative union When the body is integrated into a cy bernetic circuit modification of the circuit will necessarily modifY con sciousness as well Connected by multiple feedback loops to the objects it designs the mind is also an object of deSign In Limbo the ideology of the hyphen is threatened by the more radical implications of the cybernetic splice Like Norbert Wiener the patron saint of Limbo Wolfe responds to this threat with anxiety To see how this anxiety both generates the text and fails to contain the subversive implications of cybernetics let us tum now to a consideration of this phantasmic narrative Limbo presents itself as the notebooks of Dr Martine a neurosurgeon who defiantly left his medical post in World War III and fled to an un charted Pacific island He finds the islanders the Mandunji tribe practic ing a primitive form oflobotomy to quiet the tonus in antisocial people7 Thus the text reinscribes the privileged status of homeostasis during the Macy period and also glances toward Wieners devastating criticism oflo botomy in the 1948 CybernetiCS and the 1950 The Human Use of Human Beings 8 Wieners interest in lobotomy is played out in a short story he 116  Chapter Five wrote entitled The Brain with which Wolfe may have been familiar Pub lished in a 1950 science fiction anthology under the transparent pseudo nym w Norbert the story was explicitly attributed by the editor to Norbert Wiener In the story a mental patients attending physician brings the patient as a guest to an intellectual dinner club for a small group of scientists 9 The dinner conversation is reminiscent of the Macy discussions During dinner the patient a victim of amnesia faints When he comes to with the help of drugs he begins to recall the trauma that caused his amnesia He remem bers that he himself was a physician and that his wife was fatally injured and his child made into a vegetable in a hitandrun accident caused by a fiendishly clever gangster called The Brain Later fate delivered the gangster into the doctors hands when he was called to perform emergency surgery on the gangster who had received a bullet wound to the head Dur ing the operation the doctor qUietly performs a lobotomy Later the gang ster is caught because he has become stupid Like the protagonist of The Brain Dr Martine in Limbo performs lo botomies for the social good rationalizing that it is better to do the surgery properly than to let people die from infections and botched jobs He uses the operations to do neuroresearch on brainfunction mapping He discov ers that no matter how deeply he cuts certain characteristics appear to be twinned One twin cannot be excised without sacrificing the other When aggression is cut out eroticism goes too when violence yields to the sur geons knife creativity also disappears Martine expands his observations into a theory of human nature Humans are essentially hyphenated crea tures he asserts creativedestructive peacefulaggressive The appear ance on the island of queer limbs men who have had their arms and legs amputated and replaced by atomicpowered plastic prostheses brings Martines philosophy of the hyphen into juxtaposition with the splice the neologistic cutting rejoining and recircuiting that makes a cybernetic organism into a cyborg On the level of plot the intrusion of the cyborgs gives Martine an excuse to leave his island family and find out how the world has shaped up in the aftermath of the war The islandmainland dichotomy is the first of a proliferating series of di visions Their production follows a characteristic pattern First the narra tive presents what appears to be a unity the island locale the human psyche which nevertheless cleaves in two mainlanders come to the is land twin impulses are located within the psyche The cleavage arouses anxiety and textual representations try to achieve unity again by undergo ing metamorphosis usually truncation or amputation Martine and the From Hyphen 0 Splice  narrative leave the island behind and concentrate on the mainland which posits itself as a unity the islanders undergo lobotomies to make them whole citizens again The logic implies that truncation is necessary if the part is to reconfigure itself as a whole Better to formalize the split and ren der it irreversible so that life can proceed according to a new definition of what constitutes wholeness Vithout truncation however painful it may be the part is doomed to exist as a remainder But amputation always proves futile in the end because the truncated part splits in two again and the relentless progression continues Through delirious and savage puns the text works out the permutations of this geography of the Imaginary America has been bombed back to the Inland Strip its coastal areas now virtually uninhabited wastelands The image of a tnmcated country its outer extremities blasted away proves prophetic for the ruling political ideology is Immob Immob espouses such slogans as No Demobilization vithout Immobilization and Pacifism means Passivity Citing Napoleon Paul Virilio wrote The capacity for war is the capacity for movementl0 Immob reinscribes that proposition and reverses its import reasoning that the only way to end war is to remove the capacity for motion True believers become volamps men who have undergone voluntary amputations of their limbs Social mobility paradoxi cally translates into physical immobility Upwardly mobile executives have the complete treatment to become quadroamps janitors are content to be uniamps women and blacks are relegated to the limbo of unmodified bod ies But like the constructions that preceded it Immob ideology also splits in two The majority party discovering that its adherents are restless lying around with nothing to do approves the replacement of missing limbs with powerful prostheses or pros which bestow enhanced mobility and en able those who wear them to perform athletic feats impossible for unal tered bodies These cyborgs are called in a twinning pun that tries to encompass the cyborg under the sign of the hyphen Propros The logic of the hyphen dictates that Propros be mirrored by Antipros who believe that cyborgism is a perversion oflmmob philosophy Antipros spend their days proselytizing for voluntary amputation using microphones hooked up to the baby baskets that are just the right size to accommodate their limb less human torsos a detail that later becomes significant Unity cleavage tnmcation and further cleavagethese are the coun ters through which geopolitical and cybernetic endocolonization are rep resented in Limbo Amputations undertaken in an effort to stop the proliferation of doubleness only drive the plot toward the next phase of the cycle for they are nostalgic attempts to recover a unity that never was  Chapter Five This much Wolfe sees clearly Less clear is the increasingly urgent issue of how the parts should be reassembled through a hyphen or through a cir cuit I suggested earlier that the cyborg subverts Martines and Wolfes theory of the hyphen for it implies that the hyphenated polarities will not be able to maintain their identity unchanged This possibility although not explicitly recognized by the narrator is already encoded into the text for the amputations intended to ensure that paCifism is irrevocable have in stead ensured that the interface between human and machine is irrevoca ble Although the Propros justify the use of prostheses by pointing out that the pros can be detached many of the changes such as permanently in stalled biosockets into which the pros are snapped have become integral parts of the organism In a larger sense the conversions have worked such farreaching changes in social and economic infrastructures that a return to a precybernetic state is not possible Whether functioning as an amputee or a prosthetiC athlete the citizen of Limbos world is spliced into cybernetic circuits that irreversibly connect his body to the truncated militaryindus trial limbo that the world has become In the circuit of metaphoric ex changes that the cyborg sets up the narrator finds it increaSingly difficult to maintain the hyphenated separations that allow Wolfe to criticize capitalist society while maintaining intact his own sexist and technological assump tions Breakdown occurs when the hyphen is no longer sufficient to keep body gender and political categories separate from one another In explOring this breakdown I will go further into Wolfes background and his relation to cybernetiCS Not one to disguise his From Hyphen to Splice  made that the human mechanism although unknown might plausibly be the same as the mechanism embodied in the model The laboratory white box is thus discursively equated with the human black box with the re sult that the human is now also a white box that is a servomechanism whose workings are known Once the correlation is made cybernetics can be used not only to correct dysfunction but also to improve normal func tioning As a result the cyborg signifies something more than a retrofitted human It points toward an improved hybrid species that has the capacity to be humanitys evolutionary successor As we saw in chapter 4 the prob lem that Wiener encountered was how to restrain this revolutionarypoten tial of cybernetics so that it would not threaten the liberal humanism that so deeply informed his thinking In Self Portrait a short story published a few months before Limbo and concerned with similar themes Wolfe shows that he understands the limitations as well as the potential of Wieners method Cybernetics is sim ply the science of building machines that will duplicate and improve on the organs and functions of the animal based on what we know about the sys tems of communication and control in the animal the narrator says But he acknowledges that everything depends on just how many of the fimc tions you want to duplicate just how much of the total organ you want to re place12 In charge of a cybernetics laboratory he decides to separate kinesthetic and neural functioning He can be reasonably sure of creating an artificial limb that moves like a real one but connecting it to the bodys sensoryneural circuits is another matter 13 His hesitation points up how speculative many of Wieners claims were More than a technology they functioned as an ideology Without mentioning Wolfe Douglas D Noble in Mental Materiel The Militarization of Learning and Intelligence in US Education argues that the cybernetiC paradigm has in fact brought about massive transformations in VS social economic and educational infrastructures as Wolfe predicted it would 14 In his view these transfor mations have been driven primarily by the V S military The cyborg Noble insists is no science fiction fantasy but an accurate image of the modern American soldier including pilots wired into intelligent cockpits ar tillery gunners connected to computerized guidance systems and infantry soldiers whose ground attacks are instantaneously broadcast on global tele vision His analysiS consistent with arguments by military strategists for neocortical warfare and with the picture that Chris Gray draws of the mil itarys interest in the cyborg15 indicates that Wieners antimilitary stance was not sufficient to prevent the marriage of war and cybernetics a union that he both feared and helped to initiate Limbo takes the leap that Self Portrait resists imagining that under the stimulus of war the machine component no longer limited to mimick ing an organic limb is hardwired into the human nervous system to form an integrated cybernetic circuit This movement toward the splice is figured in Limbo through tropes of motion Here Wolfe follows Wieners lead for most of Wieners examples concentrate on dysfunctions of movement The intention tremor provided Wiener with one of his first experimental suc cesses Through a mechanism that duplicated the behavior of an intention tremor Wiener diagnosed the problem as an inappropriate positive ampli fication of feedback and showed how it could be cured Other kinds of movement dysfunctions are Similarly diagnosed in the 1948 CybernetiCS Even phenomena not obviously associated with motor skills are figured as various kinds of motion Thinking for example is figured as movement across neural synapses and schizophrenia is represented as a feedback problem in the cognitiveneural loop Wieners emphasis on movement im plies that curing dysfunctions of movement can cure the patient of what ever ails him whether muscular neural or psychological Given this context what could be more cybernetiC than to construct war as a dysfunc tion of movement In this sense Limbo follows the line of thought that Wiener mapped out in CybernetiCS down to particular phrasings that Wolfe appropriates Because in many respects Wolfe follows Wiener so closely the departure he makes in insisting on the typographic hyphen rather than the cybernetiC splice is even more Significant In the end how ever his resistance to the splice fails to restrain the scarier implications of cybernetics much as Wieners resistance to the cybernetic penetration of boundaries failed to prevent the dissolution of the liberal humanist subject The breakdown of Wolfes hyphenation theory occurs perhaps pre dictably when the hyphen is no longer sufficient to contain the repressed violence that the cyborg unleashes uncannily so for the text operates as if Wolfe were unconsciously reenacting from Wieners war work on antiair craft devices the mapping of enemy onto self In the world of Limbo war fare has been replaced by a Superpower Olympics between the capitalist Inland Strip and the communist East Union a competition deSigned to sublimate lethal violence into healthy competition But in the 1990 Olympics as if in recognition of Wieners failure to prevent the promiscu ous coupling of cybernetiCS with military research after World War II cy borg competition neologistically slides into warfare rather than metonymically substitutes for it Athletes from both sides are volamps and they owe their victories as much to the technicians who design the prostheses as they do to their athletic abilities Traditionally the Inland From Hyphen to Splice  Strip with its superior technology has dominated the Olympics Vishinu leader of the East Union announces that this year it will be different His people are tired of the imperialist smugness of the Inland Strip and will demonstrate that they are no secondrate colonials but are superior cyber neticians The East Union cyborgs proceed to sweep the competition win ning every category For weeks before the event Vishinu has darkly hinted at the growing schism between the two countries The rare metal columbium is needed to make the prostheses on which both sides depend and the East Union al leges that the Inland Strip has been trying to hoard the worlds columbium supply At the final ceremony instead of confirming that East Union cyber neticians will share their technology with the Inland Strip as custom dictates Vishinu Signals the East Union athletes to unveil their newest prosthetic innovation artificial arms that terminate in guns According to the Wests own logiC Vishinu satirically argues the East Unions triumph in cybernetics means that it has won the right to all the worlds columbium While Martine watches incredulously on his television at a remote moun tain retreat the East Union cyborgs open fire on the reviewing stand where Inland Strip officials are seated The apparatus of war has imploded inward to join with flesh and bone As a result of this cybernetic splice war radiates from body zones outward In the last war when the EMSIAC computer mindlessly tried to return Martines plane to basewhich would have returned him to almost certain deathMartine ripped out the circuit cables and destroyed the communi cationcontrol box But now endocolonization has proceeded far enough into the human and political body so that he can no longer disable the cir cuit simply by ripping out cables Instead of fleeing to the margins he rushes toward the center returning to the capital and demanding an audi ence with Helder Vishinus western counterpart He uses as his calling card cryptic allusions to an incident that only he and Helder know about an in cident that hints at the network of anxieties that have been activated through cyborg circuitry The return of these repressed anxieties takes the form of a corpse that refusing to stay buried haunts the narrative Throughout Martines notebook reluctant alibi for his roommate Helder allowing Helder to escape prose cution for the rapemanslaughter The placement of Martines recollection of the incident and his use of it to address the political crisis hint that the body politic and the politics of the body like prostheses and trunk are spliced together in an integrated circuit Throughout the text the narratorand behind him the authorhas exhibited profound ambivalence toward women This ambivalence like so much else in Wolfes cybernetic novel is figured through tropes of motion Shortly after his arrival at the Inland Strip Martine looks down onto the balcony of the apartment below and sees a quadroamp lying on a lounge reading a book A young woman tries to arouse him sexually and begins to remove his prostheses Uninterested the young man pushes her away and resumes reading The incident illustrates how sexual politics work under Immob Prohibited from becoming volamps women have taken the ini tiative in sexual encounters They refuse to have sex with men wearing prostheses for the interface between organism and mechanism is not per fect and at moments of stress or tension the limbs are apt to careen out of control smashing whatever is in the vicinity Partnered with truncated im mobilized men women have perfected techniques that are performed in the female superior position and that give them satisfaction while requiring no motion from the men Martine gets a firsthand demonstration when Neen an artist visiting from the East Union seduces him To Martine the idea that men would be immobile during sex is obscene for he believes that the only normal sexual experience for women is a vaginal orgasm reached using the male superior position Like his Victorian antecedents Martine atavistically polices what kinds of movements are proper for women during sexual intercourse enforcing them with violence when necessary To re venge himself on Neen and assure himself that he has not been emascu lated after her clitoral orgasm he rapes her and forces her to have a vaginal orgasm which the text assures us she enjoys in spite of herself Here the rape occurs in a context where Wolfe is in control of the dynamiCS for it reflects his own deeply misogynistic views Nevertheless the narra tive keeps moving toward the moment when another rape will be recalled and when the cyborg circuitry in which the narrator is enmeshed will make authorial control much less certain On a structural level the text strives to maintain the ideological purity of male identity by constructing categOrical and hierarchical differences be tween men and women The man has a real penis the woman a shadowy surrogate that the narrator calls a phantom penis the man is active the woman passive the man has a Single orgasm of undoubted authenticity From Hyphen to Splice I whereas the womans orgasms are duplicitous as well as double The man responds to sexual aggression but the narrator insists it is the woman who initiates sexual violence even when she is raped So far the novel reads like a devils dictionary of sexist beliefs that are Neolithic even by the standards of the 1950s Yet at the same time the text also edges toward a realization that it cannot unequivocally articulate Like man and machine male and female are spliced together in a feedback circuit that makes them mutually determine each other No less than geopolitical ideology sexual ideology is subverted and reconfigured by the cybernetic paradigm Wolfes outrageously sexist views echo those of his psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler by whom he was deeply influenced16 Bergler acknowl edged that it could be difficult for some women to reach orgasm in the male superior position but he nevertheless insisted that only this position and only vaginal orgasms were normal for women The view is inscribed in Limbo where the usual as distinct from normal state for women is frigidity Martine applies the label liberally using it to describe every woman with whom he is intimate except one his island wife Ooda Frigid ity applies both to women who are too aggressive like N een and to women who find sex with Martine unsatisfYing like his first wife Irene whose con nection with N een is Signified by the rhyme connecting their names With astonishing blindness he never considers that the dysfunction might lie in him or his view of women The text strives to endorse the narrators blind ness Yet it also engenders ambiguities beyond the narrators control and perhaps beyond Wolfes The kind of cyborg that Wolfe envisions locates the cybernetic splice at the joining of appendage to trunk As the placement of the splice suggests the novels sexual politics revolve around fear of symbolic and actual castra tion manifested as extreme anxiety about issues of control and domination Wolfe described by his biographer as a small man with a large mustache and fat cigar creates in Immob a fantasy about technolOgical extensions of the male body that endow it with supernatural power 17 During the sex act however the extensions are laid aside and only a truncated body remains If the artificial limbs swell to an unnatural potency the hidden price is the withering of the limb called in US slang the third leg or the short arm The connection becomes explicit when Martine discovers that his son Tom whom he has not seen in twenty years has become an activist in the Antipro cause Tom is a quadroamp spending his days spreading the word from the baby basket that accommodates his limbless trunk When war breaks out his already truncated body is mutilated by exploding glass shards Martine finds him in the street lifts the blanket that covers his  Chapter Five trunk and sees the mark of castration as well as the wounded torso He then shoots Tom ostensibly to put him out of his misery and perhaps also to ex orcise the specter of castration he represents In more than one sense Limbo is a masculine fantasy that relates to women through mechanisms of projection It is moreover a fantasy fixated in male adolescence Wavering between infantile dependence and adult potency Immob recreates every time a man takes off his prostheses to have sex the dynamic typical of male adolescence With the pros on a vol amp is capable of feats that even pros like O J Simpson and Mike Tyson would envy With the pros off he is reduced to infantile dependence on women The unity sought in becoming a volamp is given the lie by the split he experiences within himself as a superman and a symbolically castrated infant The woman is constructed in correspondingly ambivalent waysas a willing victim to male violence a nurturing mother who infantilizes her son and a domineering sex partner all too willing to find pleasure in the mans symbolic castration The instabilities in her subject position are con sistentwith the ambiguities characteristic of male adolescence The narra tives overwritten prose penchant for puns and hostility toward women all recall a perpetually adolescent male who has learned to use what Martine calls a screen of words to compete with other men and to insulate himself from emotional involvements with women Were this all Limbo was the novel would be merely frustrating rather than frustrating and brilliant What makes it compelling is its ability to rep resent and comment on its own limitations Consider the explanation that Martine gives for why Immob has been so successful The author drops a broad hint in the baby baskets that Immob devotees adopt In a theory adapted from Berglers book on narcissism Wolfe has his narrator suggest that the narcissistic wound from which the amputations derive is the male infants separation from the mother and his outraged discovery that his body is not coextensive with the world 18 Amputation allows the man to re turn to his preOedipal state where he will have his needs cared for by at tentive and nurturing females In locating the moment of trauma before the Oedipal triangle Wolfe reenacts the same kind of move that Lacan makes in his revision of Freud Whereas Freud identified the male childs fear of castration with the moment when he sees female genitalia and con structs them as lack Wolfe following Bergler places the anxious moment considerably earlier in the series ofsplittings and separations that the in fant experiences from his primary love object the mother 19 Given this sce nario the catalyst for anxiety is not the womans lack but the ambiguity of boundaries between infant and mother The mother is the object of pro From Hyphen to Splice  jected anger for two contradictory but paradoxically reinforcing reasons When she withdraws from the infant she traumatizes him when she does not withdraw she engulfs him The question of who is responsible for the narcissistic wound and its aftermath is a matter for anxious consideration in Limboa query presupposing that the violation of boundaries is central to the formation of male subjectivity In its stagings of traumatic moments of splitting the text vacillates on its answers to the question At times it seems that the woman is appropriating the male infant into her body at other times it seems that the amputated men are willfully forcing women into nurturing roles they would rather escape In fact once male and fe male are plugged into a cybernetic circuit the question of origin becomes irrelevant Each constitutes the other In approaching this realization the text goes beyond the presuppositions that underlie its sexual politics as it gropes however tentatively toward cyborg subjectivity Crucial to this process are transformations in the textual body trans formations that reenact and represent the textual dynamiCS of Immob The textual body begins by figuring itself as Martines notebook mark ii written in the narrative present In this notebook Martine notices that Immob slogans have a disturbingly familiar ring particularly the icon of a man getting run over by a steamroller intended to symbolize technology before Immob although for the narrator and reader it precisely charac terizes Immob Only when war erupts does Martine realize why the steamroller image is eerily familiar In a notebook that he wrote two decades earlier and that he entitled mark i he used the steamroller as an ironic emblem for the war machine In the same notebook and in a simi larly ironic vein he wrote a satiric fantasy of a society in which people pre empt the atrocities of war by voluntarily cutting off their own limbs After Martine deserted and rerouted his plane to the island Helder found the notebook among Martines gear and decided to use the satire as a blue print for an actual postwar society Surrounding Martines bitter jokes with his own flatfooted selfserving commentary he ventriloquized Martines words making them speak the message he wanted not what Martine intended Martines notebook thus functions like a child whom he abandoned just as he abandoned his son Tom when he fled and who then was turned into the very thing Martine dreaded most as was Tom The present narrative is recorded in the mark ii notebook The revela tion that the Immob bible is actually Martines mis appropriated mark i notebook demonstrates that the body of the text is subject to the same kind of cleavages truncations and further cleavages that mark the bodies represented within the text 126  Chapter Five Although Martine tries to heal the split narrative by renouncing the first notebook and destroying the second the narrative continues to fragment The form this fragmentation takes is significant for it follows the geogra phy ofImmob The text splits into a trunk consisting of the main narrative and prosthetic extensions constituted through drawings that punctuate the text and lines that scrawl down the page where the trunk ends Prosthesis and trunk are connected through puns that act like cyborg circuitry spliC ing the organic body of the writing together with the prosthetic extensions that operate in a subvocal margin Pros are thus punningly and cunningly linked not only with the hyphenated Propros but also with the more dan gerous and circuitous cyborg prose the truncatedspliced noun that speaks the name of the texts body prose as well as the name of the pros theses pros attached to it and represented within it Wolfe is notthe only writer to link writing and prosthesis In Prosthesis David Wills explores connections between his fathers wooden leg and the language that the son adopted as his prosthesis of choice Trunk and pros thesis body and writing are alike in having limits and in having relations with something beyond those limits Prosthesis is the writing of my self as a limit to writing Wills explains as he interrogates the boundaries and splicings between the body of his prose and his fathers body in prose There is no simple name for a discourse that articulates with rather than issuing from the body while at the same time realizing that there is no other discoursein the sense of no other translation transfer or rela tionno other conception ofit except as itis a balancing act performed by the body a shift or transfer between the body and its exteriority20 The conHation that Wills addresses in this difficult and subtle passage is the su perimposition of a body of prose with bodies constituted within prose The passage points toward a double entanglement of the textual corpus and the physical body Writing is a way to extend the authors body into the exterior world in this sense it functions as a technological aid so intimately bound up with his thinking and neural circuits that it acts like a prosthesis At the same time the writing within itself is trying to come to terms with what it means to have a prosthesis particularly with whether the prosthesis should be incorporated into the subjects identity in which case he becomes a cy borg or should remain outside in which case the prosthesis is necessarily alien from the self and so not something one can use with the natural dex terity For Wolfe the choice cannot be made in a clearcut or unambigu ous way He can neither embrace the transformations that becoming a textual cyborg would imply nor remain content with an amputated text that has a limited range of motion So he Simultaneously crafts prosthetic exten From Hyphen to Splice  sions for the text and forbids the text to recognize them as itself Just as pros e destabilizes the concept of the natural human body so it also desta bilizes the notion of a text contained and embodied solely within its typo graphic markers Pros e implies a text spliced into a cybernetic circuit that reaches beyond the typography of the printed book into a variety of graphic and semiotic prostheses that it both authorizes and denies It is no surprise to find then that the pros e of Limbos corpus implies a dispersed subjectivity Whereas the voice that speaks from the texts trunk is clearly characterized as Martine the subject that produces and is pro duced by the prosthetic marginalia is more difficult to identity The ques tion of which voice speaks from what textual body was a complicated issue in Wolfes career To supplement his income he worked for a while as a ghostwriter for Billy Roses syndicated column Here his words issued from a body of print Signed with someone elses name He also wrote for popular science magazines including Mechanix Illustrated frequently contribut ing to articles published under someone elses byline In addition he col laborated on lowlevel popular science books One of these Plastics What Everyone Should Knott appeared under Wolfes name although it was written by someone else21 The synthetic chemical product that came of age in World War II and that Wolfe envisions as the substance of choice for prostheses thus functions as a kind of prostheSiS for his corpus extending his name through a body of print ventriloquized by someone else To explore the complex play between Martines voiced narrative and the drawings nonverbal lines and punning neologisms that serve as prosthe ses to the textual tnmk I want to consider one of the drawings in more de tail It shows a nude woman with three prosthetic legsthe Immob logoextruding from each of her nipples 22 She wears glasses carries a huge hypodermiC needle and has around her neck a series of tiny contigu ous circles which can be taken to represent the popular 1950s necklace known as a choker To the right of her figure is a grotesque and diapered male torso minus arms and legs precariously perched on a flat carriage outfitted lith Immob prosthetic legs instead of wheels He has his mouth open in a silent scream perhaps because the woman appears to be aiming the needle at him In the text immediately preceding the drawing Rose mary is mentioned Although the truncated text does not acknowledge the drawing and indeed seems unaware of its existence the proximity of Rose marys name indicates that the drawing is of her with the needle presum ably explained by her profeSSion as a nurse In a larger sense the drawing depicts the Immob woman The voiced narrative ventriloquizes her body to speak of the injustices she has inflicted 128  Chapter Five on men constructing her retrospectively as a cyborg who nourishes and emasculates cyborg sons It makes her excess signified by the needle that she brandishes and the legs that sprout from her nipples responsible for her loversons lack In this deeply misogynistic writing it is no surprise to read that woman are raped because they want to be Female excess is rep resented as stimulating and encouraging male violence and rape is poetic revenge for the violence women do to men when they are too young and helpless to protect themselves The voiced narrative strives to locate the origin of the relentless dynamiC of splitting and truncation within the fe male body According to this textual trunk the refusal of the womans body to respect decent boundaries between itself and another initiates the downward spiral into amputation and eventual holocaust Countering these narrative constructions are other interpretations au thorized by the drawings nonverbal lines puns and lapses in narrative continuity From these semiotic spaces which Julia Kristeva has associated with the feminine come inversions and disruptions of the hierarchical cat egories that the narrative uses to construct maleness and femaleness 23 Rosemary written into nonexistence by her suicide within the texts repre sented world returns in the prosthetic space of the drawing and demands to be acknowledged On multiple levels the drawing deconstructs the nar ratives gender categories In the represented world women are not al lowed to be cyborgs yet this female figure has more pros attached to her body than does any man Women rank after men in the represented world but here the womans body is on the left and is thus read before the mans Above all women and men are separate and distinct in the represented world but in this space parts of the mans body have attached themselves to her Faced with these disruptions the voiced narrative is forced to rec ognize that it does not unequivocally control the textual space The semi otic intrusions contest its totalizing claims to write the world The challenge is reflected within the narrative by internal contradictions that translate into pros e the intimations of the semiotic disruptions As the voiced narrative tries to come to grips with these contradictions it cycles closer to the realization that the hierarchical categories of male and female have imploded into the same space The lobotomies that Martine performs suggest the depth of this collapse To rid the psyche coded male in Limbo of subversive female elements it is necessary to amputate For a time the amputations work allowing male performance to be enhanced by prosthe ses that bestow new potency But eventually these must be shed and the woman encountered again Then the subvocal feminine within merges with the prostheses without initiating a new cycle of violence and ampu From Hyphen to Splice  tation No matter how deeply the cuts are made they can never excise the ambiguities that haunt and constitute these posthuman and post typographic bodies Limbo envisions cybernetics as a writing technology that inscribes over the hierarchical categories of traditional sexuality the in determinate circuitry of cyborg gender As a white male writing in the early 1950s Wolfe was aware that the pol itics of gender relations were beginning to shift Several times the narrator mentions womens liberation quarantined by quotation marks and au thorial scorn Nevertheless even he cannot escape the feminine within After ending his first notebook with a huge NO inscribed across the page the narrator ends the second notebook with an equally vehement YES which he intends as an affirmation of humankinds hyphenated na ture His mothers birth name was Noyes Noyes and he dimly senses the connection between matrilineal heritage and the affirmation he seeks But the hyphen is not the same as the splice By inscribing Noyes as Noyes he seeks to draw a line that will preserve each half of the hyphenation as a distinct entity His voiced concessions to sexual politics are Similarly limited to realiZing that women are not entirely monsters The real power relations at stake in sexist relations remain opaque to him just as do the deeper im plications of being wired into a cybernetic circuit But Limbo knows more than it can say a paradox inscribed within the text by the narrators image of a screen of words that hides something from him Throughout there are flashes ofinsight that exceed his formula tions and that are never adequately accounted for by his theOrizing The ef fect is finally of another voice trying to emerge authored not so much by Wolfe as by the cybernetic circuit he can imagine but not fully articulate Just as Martines first notebook has been ventriloquized by Helder so the narrative as a whole is ventriloquized by a constellation of forces that make it speak of a future in which hyphenation gives way to the spliced prose that both signifies and is the cyborg If the ownership of the writing with which the prostheSiS signifies is unclear the obscurity is appropriate for it indicates that control in a cybernetiC circuit is not a localized function but is an emergent property Neither entirely in control nor out of control Limbo teeters on the edge of an important recognition In one sense the bodies of Limbo are the cyborgs who populate the imaginative world of Immob In another more literal sense the body of Limbo is constituted through the typefaces that march across the page Normally readers attend to the represented world and only peripherally notice the physical body of the text When the prose of Limbo itself be comes a cyborg however the splice operates to join the imaginative world 130  Chapter Five of the signifier with the physical body of print Parallels between a texts physical form and its represented world have a long history in literature from the seventeenthcentury iconographic poems of George Herbert to the maps tattoos and body writing that litter the surfaces of Kathy Ackers contemporary novels What is distinctive about Wolfes use of the correla tion is the suggestion that the bodies in the text and the body of the text not only represent cyborgs but also together compose a cyborg in which the ne ologistic splice operates to join imaginative signification with literal physi cality In this integrated circuit the physical body of the text and the bodies represented within the text evolve together toward a posthuman post typographic future in which human and intelligent machine are spliced to gether in an integrated circuit subjectivity is dispersed vocalization is non localized bodies of print are punctuated with prostheses and boundaries of many kinds are destabilized More than a conduit through which ideas from cybernetics boiled into the wider U S culture in the 1950s Limbo is a staging of the complex dynamics between cyborg and literary bodies As such it demonstrates that neither body will remain unchanged by the en counter  Chap  ter  SIx THE SECOND WAVE OF CYBERNETICS FROM REFLEXIVITY TO SELFORGANIZATION It all started with a frog In a classic article entitled What the Frogs Eye Tells the Frogs Brain central players in the Macy groupincluding Warren McCulloch Walter Pitts and Jerry Lettvindid pioneering work on a frogs visual system They demonstrated with great elegance that the frogs visual system does not so much represent reality as construct it 1 Whats true for frogs must also hold for humans for theres no reason to be lieve that the human neural system is uniquely constructed to show the world as it really is Not everyone in the research group was interested in pursuing the potentially radical epistemological implications of this work McCulloch for example remained wedded to realist epistemology But a young neurophysiologist from Chile Humberto Maturana was also on the research team and he used it as a springboard into the unknown Pushing the envelope of traditional scientific objectivity he developed a new way of talking about life and about the observers role in describing living systems Entwined with the epistemological revolution he started are the three sto ries we have been follOwing the reification of information the cultural and technological construction of the cyborg and the transformation of the hu man into the posthuman As a result of work by Maturana and his collabo rator Francisco Varela all three stories took decisive turns during the second wave of cybernetics from 1960 to 1985 This chapter follows the paths that Maturana and Varela took as they probed deeply into what it means to acknowledge that the observer like the frog does not so much discern preexisting systems as create them through the very act of observa tion Central to the seriated changes connecting these secondwave develop ments to the first wave is the difficult and protean concept of reflexivity As we saw in chapter 3 participants in the Macy Conferences wrestled with  Chapter Six reflexivity without much success The particularities of the situationthe embedding of reflexivity within psychoanalytic discourse Kubies halito sis of the personality the unquantifiability of reflexive conceptsput a spin on reflexivity that affected its subsequent development 2 Gregory Batesons 1968 conference had made clear that the problems posed by in cluding the observer could be addressed only if a substantial reworking of realist epistemology was undertaken The intuitive leap made by Bateson in concluding that the internal world of subjective experience is a metaphor for the external world remained a flash of insight rather than a quantita tively reliable inference that experimentalists like Warren McCulloch could endorse The problem was how to make the new epistemology oper ational by integrating it with an experimental program that would replace intuition with empirical data At issue in this evolving series of events are questions crucially important to the technoscientific concepts of information the cyborg and the posthuman Like Norbert Wiener Maturana has strong ties with liberal humanism At stake for him was how to preserve the central features of autonomy and individuality while still wrenching them out of the Cartesian and Enlightenment frameworks in which they are embedded Even as he struggled mightily to say something new his work replicates some assumptions of the first wave at the same time that it radically revises oth ers3 Ve can see an early form of the struggle in the essays of Heinz von Foerster the genial and wellconnected Austrian emigre who functions as a transitional figure linking first and secondwave cybernetics From this beginning we will trace the epistemological revolution that Maturana fo mented delineate its connections with the three stories we have been fol lowing and finally explore the differing assumptions that led Varela Maturanas collaborator to set off in a new direction Reflexivity Revisited Von Foerster left Austria in 1948 after working on microwave electronics for Germany during World War II work that had important applications in radar his 1949 vita lists much of this research as secret4 In the spring of 1949 von Foerster wrote McCulloch renowned for his generosity in help ing younger men to seek his help in finding a job in North America5 McCulloch found the Austrian a position at the University of Illinois he also introduced von Foerster into the Macy group Soon afterward McCulloch and Mead asked von Foerster ifhe would serve as prinCipal ed itor of the published transcripts Although he had some misgivings because The Second Wave of Cybernetics I English was not his native language he agreed With his name emblazoned on the title pages the published transcripts are associated with him as much as with anyone It was not until the Macy Conferences had run their course however that von Foerster tried to develop more fully the epistemological implica tions ofincluding the observer as part of the system The punning title of his essay collection Observing Systems announces reHexivity as a central theme Observing is what human systems do in another sense hu man systems themselves can be observed The earliest essay On Self Organizing Systems and Their Environments taken from a presentation given in 1960 shows von Foerster thinking about reHexivity as a circular dy namic that can be used to solve the problem of solipsism How does he know other people exist he asks Because he experiences them in his imag ination His experience leads him to believe that other people similarlyex perience him in their imaginations IfI assume that I am the sole reality it turns out that I am the imagination of somebody else who in turn assumes that he is the sole reality6 In a circle of intersecting solipsisms I use my imagination to conceive of someone else and then of the imagination of that person in which I find myself reHected 7 Thus I am reassured not only of the other persons existence but of my own as well Although charmingly posed the argument is lOgically nonsensical for there is no assurance that other imaginations are conceiving of me any more than I am conceiving of them Maybe I am thinking not about von Foerster but about a Big Mac That even a Hedgling philosopher could reduce the argument to shreds is perhaps beside the point Von Foerster himself seemed to recognize that the argument was the philosophical equivalent to pulling a rabbit from a hat for he finally solves the paradoxical circling between solipsistiC imag inations by asserting what he was to prove namely the existence of reality Although the argument is far from rigorous it is interesting for the line of thought it suggests Its implications are illustrated by a cartoon drawn by Gordon Pask at von Foersters request of a man in a bowler hat in whose head is pictured another man in a bowler hat in whose head is yet another man in a bowler hat 8 The potentially infinite regress of men in bowler hats does more than create an image of the observer who observes himself by observing another It also visually distinguishes the observer as a discrete system inside the larger system of the organism In the aftermath of the Macy Conferences one of the central problems with reHexivitywas how to talk about it without falling into solipsism or resorting to psychoanalYSiS The message from the Macy Conferences was clear if reHexivity was to be credible it had to be insulated against subjectivity and presented in a context in which it had at least the potential for rigorous preferably math ematical formulation As Norbert Wiener was later to proclaim Cyber netics is nothing if it is not mathematicalg Distinguishing the observer as a system separate from the organism was one way to make reflexivity more manageable for it reduced the problem of the observer to a problem of communication among systems Throughout the 1960s von Foerster remained convinced of the impor tance of reflexivity and he experimented with various ways to formulate it A breakthrough occurred in 1969 when he invited Maturana to speak at a conference at the University ofIllinois There Maturana unveiled his ideas about treating cognition as a biological phenomenonl0 The power of Maturanas theory must have deeply affected von Foerster for his thinking about reflexivity takes a quantum leap in complexity after this date The in creased sophistication can be seen in his 1970 essay Molecular Ethology An Immodest Proposal for Semantic Clarification in which he criticizes behaviorism by making the reflexive move of turning the focus from the ob servation back onto the observer Behaviorism does not demonstrate that animals are black boxes that give predictable outputs for given inputs he argues Rather behaviorism shows the cleverness and power of the experi menter in getting animals to behave as such Instead of searching for mechanisms in the environment that tum organisms into trivial machines we have to find the mechanisms within the organisms that enable them to tum their environment into a trivial machinell Here reflexivity moves from men in bowler hats to the beginning of a powerful critique of objec tivist epistemology By 1972 von Foerster had been so thoroughly con vinced by Maturanas theory that one of the latest essays in Observing Systems  The Second Wave of Cybernetics  story discussed in chapter 5 From the wiredup brain the researchers dis covered that small objects in fast erratic motion elicited maximum re sponse whereas large slowmoving objects evoked little or no response It is easy to see how such perceptual equipment is adaptive from the frogs point of view because it allows the frog to perceive flies while ignoring other phenomena irrelevant to its interests The results implied that the frogs perceptual system does not so much register reality as construct it As the authors noted their work shows that the frogs eye speaks to the brain in a language already highly organized and interpreted instead of transmit ting some more or less accurate copy of the distribution of light upon the receptors 12 The workled Maturana to the maxim fundamental to his epis temology Everything said is said by an observer AC p xxii No wonder the article was quickly recognized as a classic for it blew a frogsized hole in realist epistemology Despite the potentially radical implications of the articles content how ever its form reinscribed conventional realist assumptions of scientific dis course The results are reported in an objectivist rhetoric that masks the fact they are interpreted through the sensory and cognitive interfaces of embodied researchers whose perceptions were at least as transformative as the frogS Years later Maturana would recall that he and Lettvin contin ued to work in an objectivist framework even as that framework was being called into question by their research In the preface to Autopoiesis and Cognition The Realization of the Living Maturana recalled When Jerry Y Lettvin and I wrote our several articles on frog vision  we did it with the implicit assumption that we were handling a clearly defined cognitive situation there was an objective absolute reality external to the animal and independent of it not determined by it which it could perceive cog nize  But even there the epistemology that guided our thinking and writing was that of an objective reality independent of the observer AC p xiv Faced with this inconsistency Maturana had a choice He could continue to work within the prevailing assumptions of scientific objectivity or he could devise a new epistemology that would construct a worldview consistent with what he thought the experimental work showed The break came with his work on color vision in other animals including birds and primates He and his coauthors not the Macy group this time found they could not map the visible world of color onto the activity of the nervous system13 There was no onetoone correlation between percep tion and the world They could however correlate activity in an animals retina with its experience of color If we think of sense receptors as consti tuting a boundary between outside and inside this implies that organiza 136  Chapter Six tionally the retina matches up with the inside not the outside From this and other studies Maturana concluded that perception is not fundamen tally representational He argued that to speak of an objectively existing world is misleading for the very idea of a world implies a realm that preex ists its construction by an observer Certainly there is something out there which for lack of a better term we can call reality But it comes into existence for us and for all living creatures only through interactive pro cesses determined solely by the organisms own organization No descrip tion of an absolute reality is possible he and Varela wrote in Autopoiesis and Cognition for such a description would require an interaction with the absolute to be described but the representation that would arise from such an interaction would necessarily be determined by the autopoietic or ganization of the observer  hence the cognitive reality that it would gen erate would unavoidably be relative to the observer AC p 121 Thus he was led to a premise fundamental to his theory living systems operate within the boundaries of an organization that closes in on itself and leaves the world on the outside With Varela Maturana developed the implications of this inSight in Autopoiesis and Cognition He arrived at his theory he explains in the in troduction by deciding to treat the activity of the nervous system as deter mined by the nervous system itself and not by the external world thus the external world would have only a triggering role in the release of the inter nallydetermined activity of the nervous system AC p xv His key in Sight was to realize that if the action of the nervous system is determined by its organization the result is a circular selfreflexive dynamiC A living sys tems organization causes certain products to be produced for example nucleic acids These products in tum produce the organization character istic of that living system To describe this circularity he coined the term autopoiesis or selfmaking It is the circularity of its organization that makes a living system a unit of interactions he and Varela wrote in Au topoiesis and Cognition and it is this circularity that it must maintain in or der to remain a living system and to retain its identity through different interactions AC p 9 Building on this premise of autopoietic closure Maturana developed a new and startlingly different account of how we know the world 14 What is this account One path into it is to regard the account as an at tempt to counteract anthropomorphic projection by clearly distinguishing between two domains of description On the one hand there is what one can say about the circularity of autopoietic processes in themselves taking care not to attribute to them anything other than what they exhibit On the The Second Wave of Cybernetics  other hand there are the inferences that observers draw when they place an autopoietic system in the context of an environment Seeing system and medium together over a period of time observers draw connections be tween cause and effect past and future But these are the observers infer ences they are not intrinsic to the autopoietic processes in themselves Lets say I see a blue jay flash through the trees and settle on the birdbath I may think Oh its getting a drink Other species for example those lack ing color vision would react to this triggering event with different con structions A frog might notice the quiCk erratic flight but be oblivious to the blue jay at rest Each living system thus constructs its environment through the domain of interactions made possible by its autopoietic or ganization What lies outside that domain does not exist for that system Maturana realizing that he was fighting a long tradition of realist assump tions deeply embedded in everyday language developed an elaborate vo cabulary as a prophylactic against having anthropomorphism creep back in The necessity of finding a new language in which to express his theory was borne home to him during the student revolution in Chile in May 1968 It was then he wrote in Autopoiesis and Cognition that he discovered that language was a trap but the whole experience was a wonderful school in which one could discover how mute deaf and blind one was  one began to listen and ones language began to change and then but only then new things could be said AC p xvi Shortly we will analyze places where Maturana like the participants in the Mac Conferences seems unable to escape from the tar baby of self reflexive language For the moment however let us explore the new things he tried to say No doubt the cumbersomemany would not hesi tate to call it torturedquality of his language will be immediately appar ent to the reader 15 Before we judge it harshly however we should remember that Maturana was attempting nothing less than to give a differ ent account of how we know the world Since it is partly through language that humans bring worlds into being for themselves he was in the impossi ble position of pulling himself up by his own bootstraps trying to articulate the new by using the only language available the lingua franca whose meanings had long ago settled along lines very different from those he was trying to envision We can start with that most problematic of constructions the observer From Maturanas point of view the fundamental cognitive operation that an observer performs is the operation of distinction AC p xxii Influ enced by C SpencerBrown Maturana and even more so Varela in his work Principles of Biological Autonomy Hi sees the operation of distinction as marking space so that an undifferentiated mass is separated into an in side and an outside or in Maturanas terminology into a unity and a medium in which the unity is embedded Unities distinguished by the ob server can be of two types simple and composite A simple unity only has the properties with which it is endowed by the operations of distinction through which it becomes separated from a background Composite uni ties by contrast have structure and organization AC p xx terms that Maturana uses in special senses and that require further explanation A composite unitys organization is the complex web of all possible rela tionships that can be realized by the autopoietic processes as they interact with one another When Maturana speaks of a systems organization he does not mean how this web of relationships might be described in abstract form Rather he intends organization to denote the relations actually in stantiated by the autopoietic unitys circular processes Structure by con trast is the particular instantiation that a composite unity enacts at a particular moment For example when a female human is born she has one kind of structure when she enters puberty she has another if she con tracts a disease she has still another But throughout her lifetime her orga nization remains the same that which is characteristic of a living human Only when death occurs does her organization change According to Maturana this ability of living organisms to conserve their autopoietic or ganization is the necessary and sufficient condition for them to count as liv ing systems All living systems are autopoietic and all physical systems if autopoietic can be said to be living AC p 82 Thus life and autopoiesis are coextensive with one another Heres how that proposition sounds in Maturanas terminology The living organization is a circular organization which secures the production or maintenance of the components that specify it in such a manner that the product of their functioning is the very same organization that produces them AC p 48 To account for a systems embeddedness in an environment Maturana uses the concept of structural coupling All living organisms must be struc turally coupled to their environments to continue living humans for ex ample have to breathe air drink water eat food AC pp xxi In addition systems may be structurally coupled to each other For example a cell within my body may be considered as a system in itself but it relies for its continued existence on its structural coupling to my body as a whole Here again the role of the observer becomes important for Maturana is careful to distinguish between the triggering effect that an event in the medium has on a system structurally coupled with it and the causal relationship that observers construct in their mind when they perceive the system interact The Second Wave of Cybernetics  ing with the environment When my bird dog sees a pigeon I may think Oh hes pointing because he sees the bird But in Maturanas terms this is an inference I draw from my position in the descriptive domain of ahu man observer AG p 121 From the viewpoint of the autopoietic pro cesses there is only the circular interplay of the processes as they continue to realize their autopoiesis always operating in the present moment and al ways producing the organization that also produces them Thus time and causality are not intrinsic to the processes themselves but are concepts in ferred by an observer The present is the time interval necessary for an in teraction to take place Maturana and Varela wrote Past future and time exist only for the observer AG p 18 Information coding and teleology are likewise inferences drawn by an observer rather than qualities intrinsic to autopoietic processes In the au topoietic account there are no messages Circulating in feedback loops nor are there even any genetic codes These are abstractions invented by the observer to explain what is seen they exist in the observers domain of in teractions rather than in autopoiesis itself The genetic and nervous sys tem are said to code information about the environment and to represent it in their functional organization This is untenable Maturana and Varela noted The genetic and nervous systems code processes that speCify series of transformations from initial states which can be decoded only through their actual implementation not deSCriptions that the observer makes of an environment which lies exclusively in his cognitive domain AG p 53 Similarly the notion of information refers to the observers degree of uncertainty in his behavior within a domain of alternatives defined by him hence the notion of information only applies vithin his cognitive domain AG p 54 The same applies to teleology A living system is not a goal directed system it is like the nervous system a stable statedetermined and strictlv deterministic svstem closed on itself and modulated by interac    tions not speCified byits conduct These modulations however are appar ent as modulations only for the observer who beholds the organism or the nervous system externally from his own conceptual descriptive perspec tive as lying in an environment and as elements in his domain of interac tions AG p 50 One implication ofletting go of causality is that systems always behave as they should which is to say they always operate in accord with their struc tures whatever those may be In Maturanas world my car always works whether it starts or not because it operates only and always in accord with its structure at the moment It is I as an observer who decides that my car is not working because it will not start Such punctuations as Maturana 40  Chapter Six and Varela call them belong to the domain of the observer AC pp 5556 Because they are extrinsic to the autopoietic processes they are also extrinsic to the biological description that Maturana aims to give of life and cognition In an important essay entitled Biology of Language Maturana remarks that the operation of a structuredetermined system is necessarily perfect that is it follows a course determined only by neigh borhood relations in its structure and by nothing else It is only in a referen tial domain such as the domain of behavior that an observer can claim that an error has occurred when his or her expectations are not fulfilled17 To assess the changes that the autopoietic view entails let us turn now to compare its account of living systems with that given by firstwave cyber netics A convenient focal point for the comparison of the two theories is liberal humanism where their implications for the construction of subjec tivitywill become apparent Having traced these implications we will then consider the impact of secondwave cybernetics on the entwined stories we have been following the reification of information the construction of the cyborg and the transformation of the human into the posthuman Reconfiguring the Liberal Humanist Subject As we saw in chapter 4 Norbert Wiener had a complex relation to the lib eral humanist subject Father of a theory that put humans and machines into the same category he was nevertheless committed to creating a cyber netics that would preserve autonomy and individuality His nightmare was the human reduced to a cog in a rigid machine lOSing the Hexibility and au tonomous functioning that Wiener regarded as the birthright of a cyber netic organism Echoes of this cybernetic tradition linger in Maturanas description of composite unities as autopoietic machines AC p 82 Fully aware of the implications of calling autopoietic systems machines Maturana makes clear that there is nothing in his theory to prohibit artificial systems from becoming autopoietic unities If living systems were machines they could be made by man he and Varela point out AC p 83 They poohpooh the idea that life cannot or should not be created by humans There seems to be an intimate fear that the awe with respect to life and the living would disappear if a living system could be not only re produced but deSigned by man This is nonsense The beauty of life is not a gift of its inaccessibility to our understanding AC p 83 When Maturana objects to firstwave projects that attributed biolOgical proper ties to machines his criticism addresses how life is defined not the idea that machines can be alive For example he criticizes John von Neumanns pro The Second Wave of Cybernetics  posal to create a selfreproducing machine by arguing that von Neumann modeled descriptions that biologists had made rather than autopoietic pro cesses in themselves Von Neumann modeled inferences about what ap peared to take place in the cell in terms of information content program and coding By modeling the processes expressed in these descriptions he produced a machine that could make another machine but he did not model the phenomena of cellular reproduction heredity and genetics as they take place in living systems18 This critique points to an important change between Maturanas posi tion and that announced by Wiener and his coauthors in their cybernetic manifesto Whereas the latter argued that it is the systems behavior that counts Maturana argues that it is the autopoietic processes generating be haviorthat count As we have seen firstwave researchers concentrated on building artifacts that would behave as cybernetic mechanisms John von Neumanns selfreproducing machines Claude Shannons electronic rat Ross Ash bys homeostat By contrast Maturana and others in the second wave look to systems instantiating processes that count as autopoietic The homeostat might behave cybernetically for example but it does not count as an autopoietic machine because it does not produce the components that produce its organization Perhaps because of this emphasis on process autopoietic theory has proven readily adaptable to the analysis of social sys tems In autopoietic theory the machine of interest is much more likely to be the state than Robocop or Terminator19 In first wave cybernetics questions of boundary formation were crucial to its constructions of subjectivity Boundary questions are also important in autopoietic theory Wieners anxieties recirculate in discussions about what happens when one autopoietic unity is encapsulated within the boundaries of a larger autopoietic unity for example when a cell functions as part of a larger machine Can the cell continue to function as an au tonomous entity or must its functioning be subordinated to the larger unity To distinguish these two cases Maturana introduces the term al lopoietic Whereas autopoietic unities have as their only goal the continu ing production of their autopoiesis allopoietic unities have as their goal something other than producing their organization When I drive my car its functioning is subordinated to the goals I set for it Instead of the pistons using their energy to repair themselves for example they use their energy to turn the drive shaft so that I can get to the store I function autopoieti cally but the car functions allopoietically We saw in chapter 4 that cybernetic boundary questions often involve deep ethical and psycholOgical issues such as those that troubled Wiener  Chapter Six when he envisioned the dissolution of the autonomous liberal subject In autopoietic theory one of the principal effects of autopoiesis is to secure for a living system the crucial qualities of autonomy and individuality Con sequently boundary issues are often played out in discussions of how much autonomy autopoietic systems will retain for themselves and how much autonomy they will demand from the systems with which they are structurally coupled The distinction between allopoietic and autopoietic gives Maturana a way to talk about power struggles within society In au topoietic theory the idea corresponding to Wieners horror at a man being forced to act as a cog in a machine is a system that is capable of autopoiesis being forced instead to function allopoietically especially for humans Maturanas ideal is a human society in which one would see all human be ings as equivalent to oneself and to love them  without demanding from them a larger surrender of individuality and autonomy than the mea sure that one is willing to accept for oneself while integrating it as an ob server AC p xxix Such a society he adds is in its essence an anarchist society a society made for and by observers that would not surrender their condition of observers as their only claim to social freedom and mutual re spect AC p xxx In such rhetoric we can eaSily hear a reinscription of liberal humanist values even though the epistemology that Maturana ad vocates is very different from that which gave rise to the Enlightenment subject Yet it would be a mistake to think that Maturanas radicalism can be so easily recuperated back into liberal subjectivity The split between his posi tion and liberal philosophy becomes obvious when questions of objectivity arise Consider for example his insistence that ethics cannot be separated from scientific inquiry Instead of accepting the proposition that the scien tist simply reports what he or she sees and in this sense remains aloof from ethical considerations Maturana envisions autopoietic theory as a way to reconnect ethics and science Emphasizing that autonomy always takes place in the context of structural coupling autopoiesis rejects the objec tivism that drives a wedge between the scientist observer and the world be ing observed For Maturana observation does not mean that the observer remains separate from what is being observed on the contrary the ob server can observe only because the observer is structurally coupled to the phenomenon she sees Expanded to social ethics this implies in man as a social being  all actions however individual as expressions of prefer ences or rejections constitutively affect the lives of other human beings and hence have ethical significance Structural coupling requires that human beings as components of a society necessarily realize their individ The Second Wave of Cybernetics  others AC p xxvi Although Maturana thus follows in the liberal tradition of cyberneti cians like Wiener in placing a high value on the autonomous individual the meaning of autonomy has undergone significant change Autonomy as Maturana envisions it is not consistent with laissezfaire capitalism it is not consistent with the idea that each person is out for himself and devil take the hindmost and it is not consistent with the ethical position that a scien tist could undertake a research program without being concerned about how the results of the research would be used In these respects the indi vidualism and autonomy that Maturana champions challenge the premises embodied in liberal subjectivity at least as much as they reinscribe those premises To explore further how liberal subjectivity is both contested and rein scribed in autopoietic theory let us tum now to Maturanas account of the observer Nowhere does Maturana depart more clearly from first wave philosophies than in his insistence that the observer must be taken into ac count The observer is a living system and any understanding of cognition as a biological phenomenon must account for the observer and his role in it AC p 48 The act of observation necessarily entails reflexivity for one of the systems that an observer can describe is the observer as an autopoietic system But reflexivity as Maturana envisions it is very different from the psychoanalytic reflexivity that Lawrence Kubie introduced into the Macy Conferences see chapter 3 In contrast to Kubies emphasiS on uncon scious symbolism Maturanas observer does not have psycholOgical depth or specificity Rather Maturanas observer is more like the observer that Albert Einstein posits in the special theory of relativity The one who sees is always called simply the observer without further speCification implying that any individual of that species occupying that position would see more or less the same thing Although the observers perceptions construct real ity rather than paSSively perceive it for Maturana this construction de pends on positionality rather than personality In autopoietic theory the opposite of objectivism is not subjectivism but relativism If the interplay between conscious and unconscious processes is not im portant for Maturana how is the observer produced The observer begins as an autopoietic unity as all living systems are said to be As a particular kind of autopoietic unity capable of becoming an observer the observer system can generate representations of its own interactions When the system recursively interacts with these representations it becomes an ob server The system can then recursively generate representations of these representations and interact with them as when an observer thinks I am an observing system observing itself observing Each twist of this reflexive spiral adds additional complexity enlarging the domain of interactions that specifY the world for that autopoietic unity Maturana and Varela summa rize the situation thus in Autopoiesis and Cognition We become ob servers through recursively generating representations of our interactions and by interacting with several representations simultaneously we gener ate relations with the representations of which we can then interact and re peat this process recursively thus remaining in a domain of interactions always larger than that of the representation A C p 14 Reflexivity is thus fundamental to Maturanas account not only because the autopoietic oper ations of a unity specify for it a world but also because the systems reflexive doubling back on its own representations generates the human subject as an observer What about consciousness Maturana seldom uses this word preferring to talk instead about thinking and selfconsciousness Thinking occurs in a statedetermined nervous system when neurophysiological processes can interact with some of its own internal states as if these were indepen dent entities This recursive circling corresponds to what we call think ing AC p 29 To get from thinking to selfconsciousness requires language according to Maturana In the same way that perception does not consist of information from the environment passing into the organism so language does not consist of someone giving information to someone else Rather when an observer uses language this acts as a trigger for the ob servers interlocutor allowing the interlocutor to establish an orientation within his or her domain of interactions similar to the orientation of the speaker Only when two entities have largely overlapping domainsfor ex ample when they are both humans sharing similar cultures and beliefsis it possible for them to achieve the illusion that communication between them has occurred From this description it is apparent that Maturana explains language by simply extending to the linguistic realm the same ideas and terminology he uses to explain perceptionan explanation that in my view fails to account for some of the distinctive features oflanguage Shortly we will have an op portunity to look critically at this view oflanguage For the moment it per mits us to understand Maturanas view of selfconsciousness Self consciousness arises when the observer through orienting linguistic behavior can orient himself towards himself and then generate communica tive descriptions that orient him toward his description of this selforienta tion The observer generates selfconsciousness then when he endlessly The Second Wave of Cybernetics  describes himself describing himself Thus discourse through communica tive description originates the apparent paradox of selfdescription self consciousness a new domain of interactions AC p 29 Because Maturana understands selfconsciousness solely in linguistic terms seeing it as an emergent phenomenon that arises from autopoietic processes when they re cursively interact with themselves consciousness for him becomes a epiphe nomenon rather than a defining characteristic of the human as an autopoietic entity The activity of cerebration represents only a fraction of the total au topoietic processes and selfconsciousness represents only a fraction of cer ebration Thus the theory implicitly assigns to consciousness a much more peripheral role than it does to autonomy and individualism In this respect autopoietic theory points toward the posthuman even as it reinscribes the au tonomy and individuality of the liberal subject The complex relation of autopoietic theory to liberal humanism be comes even more apparent when we ask how the theory attempts to es tablish a foundational ground for itself As we saw in chapter 1 liberal humanism in C B Macphersons reading of it grounds itself on the notion of possessive individualism the idea that subjects are individuals first and foremost because they own themselves The equivalent foundational premise in autopoietic theory is the idea that living systems are living be cause they instantiate organizational closure It is precisely this closure that guarantees the subject will operate as an autonomous individual But how is it that Maturana or anyone else knows that organizational closure ex ists Is the claim that autopoietic closure is intrinsically a feature ofliving systems or is it how a human observer perceives living systems including itself This question lies coiled around the brainstem of autopoietic theory layered into its evolutionary history through its founding distinctions be tween qualities intrinsic to autopoietic processes and qualities attributed to them by an observer If the theory says thatthe observer creates the system by drawing distinctions it risks undercutting the ontolOgical primacy of or ganizational closure If it says that autopoietic processes are an essential feature of reality it risks undercutting its epistemological radicalism Faced with this Scylla and Charybdis Maturana at first steered toward rel ativism and then as its dangers loomed closer changed course and steered toward the absolutism of autopoietic processes existing in reality as such So in Biology of Cognition the earlier essay in Autopoiesis and Cogni tion Maturana often wrote as if it is the observers action that distinguishes an autopoietic unity from its background or medium Although a distinc tion performed by an observer is a cognitive distinction and strictly the unity thus specified exists in his cognitive domain as a description the ob 146  Chapter Six server in his discourse specifies a metadomain of descriptions from the per spective of which he established a reference that allows him to speak as if a unity  existed as a separate entity AC p xxii emphasis added This im plies the autopoietic unity exists as a distinction that is performed by the ob server rather than as an entity that could exist in the absence of an observer However in Autopoiesis The Organization of the Living the second and later essay in Autopoiesis and Cognition Maturanaand Varela wrote as if an autopoietic unity has the ability to constitute itself independent of an ob server Autopoietic machines through their interactions and transforma tions    continuously regenerate and realize the network of processes relations that produced them in the process constituting themselves as a concrete unity in the space in which they the components exist by speci fying the topological domain of the autopoietic machines realization of such a network AC p 79 Here the operation of the autopoietic entity it selfrather than a distinction drawn by an observercreates the space in which the entity exists Even more explicit is the claim that individuality comes from the processes themselves rather than from the actions of an ob server Autopoietic machines have individuality that is by keeping their organization as an invariant through its continuous production they ac tively maintain an identity which is independent of their interactions with an observer AC p 80 It is not surprising that the issue continues to be debated in autopoietic theory for it admits of no easy solution In Maturanas desire to found au topoiesis on something more than an observers distinction we can see him trying to pull away from the tar baby of his own reflexive language Relevant for our purposes is not so much the resolution to this dilemma as if there could be a definitive resolution or even the demonstration that the the orys founding moves make it vulnerable to de constructive critique Rather the important point here is that the foundational ground for establishing the subjects autonomy and individuality has shifted from selfpossession with all of its implications for the imbrication of the liberal subject with in dustrial capitalism Instead these privileged attributes are based on orga nizational closure the system closes on itself by itself or on the reflexivity of a system recurSively operating on its own representations the observers distinctions close the system Closure and recursivity then play the foun dational role in autopoietic theory that selfpossession played in classic lib eral theory The emphaSiS on closure is visually apparent in the computer simulations called tessellation automata that Varela created to illustrate autopoietic dynamics In contrast to the artificiallife programs that will be discussed in chapter 9 the point of tessellation simulations is to find out The Second Wave of Cybernetics I 117 how boundaries close on themselves how they are maintained when inter acting with other tessellation automata and how and when boundaries break down which in autopoietic theory is equivalent to death In this de scription we see the affinity of autopoiesis not for industrial capitalism which Maturana frequently excoriates but for utopian anarchy Auton omy is important not because it serves as the paradoxical foundation for market relations but because it establishes a sphere of existence for the in dividual a location from which the subject can ideally learn to respect the boundaries that define other autopoietic entities like itself This emphasis on closure autonomy and individuality also changes what count as primary concerns When the existence of the world is tied to an observer the urgent questions revolve around how to maintain boundaries intact and still keep connection with a world that robustly continues to exist regardless of what we think about it These changes from liberal humanism also bring with them limitations that are distinctively different from those of firstwave cybernetics Whereas firstwave philosophies tended to obscure the importance of em bodiment and the observer autopoietic theory draws its strength precisely from its emphasis on these attributes Its Achilles heel by contrast is ac counting for living systems explosive potential for transformation The very closure that gives autopoietic theory its epistemological muscle also limits the theory so that it has a difficult time accounting for dynamic inter actions that are not circular in their effects A prime example in my view is the convoluted and problematic way that Maturana treats language Con sistent with his emphasis on circularity he prefers to talk not about lan guage but languaging a process whereby observers acting solely within their own domain of interactions provide the triggers that help other ob servers Similarly orient themselves within their domains Autopoietic the ory sees this exchange as a coupling between two independent entities each of which is formed only by its own ongoing autopoietic processes As this description shows the theory is constantly in danger of solipsism a danger it both acknowledges and attempts to avoid by protesting that it is not solipsistic The main reason the theory adduces for not being solipsistic is its acknowledgment of structural coupling the phrase used to denote an organisms interaction with the environment Even if we grant that this move rescues the theory from solipsism the theory still seriously under states the transformative effects that language has on human subjects We have only to recall the term that Maturana employs for a languageusing subjectthe observer to see how curiously inert and selfenclosing is his view oflanguage What drops from view in Maturanas account is the active nature oflin guistic interactions Researchers from Jean Piaget on have shown that a childs neural hardware continues to develop after birth in conjunction with the linguistic and social environment in which the child is embedded In light of this work it is misleading to talk about the process of active shaping through language simply as an entity orienting itself with the aid of an en vironmental trigger To appreciate just how active this process is we can look at instances where it has been shortcircuited and the child thus con sequently fails to develop normally In Mindblindness An Essay on Autism and Theory of Mind Simon BaronCohen argues this is what happens with autistic children20 Somehow the shaping mechanisms fail to direct neural development and as a result the child is unable to create an internal sce nario that would explain why others act as they do For such children BaronCohen argues the world of social interactions is chaotic and unpre dictable because they suffer from mindblindness an inability to imagine for others the emotions and feelings they themselves have Autopoietic theory in its zeal to construct an autonomous sphere of action for self enclosing entities formulates a deSCription that ironically describes autis tic individuals more accurately than it does normally responsive people For the autistic person the environment is indeed merely a trigger for pro cesses that close on themselves and leave the world outside In the next section we will tum to a discussion of how autopoietic theory treats evolution Like language evolution represents another area where Maturanas version of autopoietic theory fails to come to terms with the dy namic transformative nature of the interactions between living systems and their environments From there we will explore the split that develops between Maturana and Varela While Maturana continued to replicate his original formulation of the theory Varela and others became increasingly interested in changing the theory so that it could better account for dy namic interactions Keeping many of the central insights of autopoietic theory Varela added new material and reworked some assumptions in the seriated pattern ofinnovation and replication we have seen at work in other sites One effect of these changes was to allow elements of autopoietic the ory to be integrated into contemporary cognitive science and especially artificial life which will be the focus of my discussion of thirdwave cyber netics in chapter 9 At this point a summary may be useful of how autopoietic theory con tributes to our evolving stories of 1 the reification of information 2 the construction of the cyborg and 3 the transformation of the human into the posthuman First whereas firstwave cybernetics played a large role The Second Wave of Cybernetics I in divesting information of its body autopoietic theory draws attention to the fact that information so defined is an abstraction that has no basis in the physically embodied processes constituting all living entities Au topoiesis thus swerves from the trajectory traced in chapters 3 and 4 with regard to information insisting that information without a body does not exist other than as an inference drawn by an observer Second whereas firstwave cybernetics envisioned the cyborg mostly as an amalgam be tween the organic and the mechanical autopoietic theory uses its ex panded definition oflife to speculate on whether social systems are alive The paradigmatic cyborg for autopoiesis is the state not the kind of me chanical human imagined by Bernard Wolfe or Philip K Dick Third au topoietic theory preserves the autonomy and individuality characteristic ofliberal humanism but it sees thinking as a secondary effect that arises when an autopoietic entity interacts with its own representations Self consciousness a subset of thinking is relegated to a purely linguistic effect The grounding assumptions for individuality shift from selfpos session to organizational closure and the reflexivity of a system recur sively operating on its own representations A status report then informations body is still contested the empire of the cyborg is still expanding and the liberal subject although more than ever an autonomous individual is literally lOSing its mind as the seat of identity Autopoiesis and Evolution It is no accident that evolution is a sore spot for autopoietic theory for the theory was deSigned to correct what Maturana and Varela saw as an overemphasis on evolution and reproduction as the defining characteris tics oflife Over and over they argue that evolution and reproduction are logically and practically subordinate to autopoiesis Reproduction and evolution are not essential for living organisms they assert in Autopoiesis and Cognition AC p 11 They are even more opposed to defining living organisms in terms of genetic code As Varela made clear in a retrospective assessment he and Maturana were conSciously aware of wanting to pro vide an alternative account oflife an account that would not depend in any important way on the idea of a genetic code The notion of autopoiesis was proposed  with the intention of redressing what seemed to us to be a fun damental imbalance in the understanding ofliving organization In cor rectingthis imbalance they had two interrelated goals Along with creating a theory of the living that would debunk the current emphasis on DNA as the master molecule oflife they also wanted to insist on the holistic na ture ofliving systems21 Varela is willing to admit that perhaps they erred on the side of overem phasizing autopoiesis at the expense of genetics By contrast Maturana be came if anything more confirmed in his opposition as time went on Many critics including Richard Lewontin Evelyn Fox Keller Lily Kay Richard Doyle and others have commented on the distortions created in modem biology by the present overemphasis on DNA22 But few go as far as Maturana In the 1980 article Autopoiesis Reproduction Heredity and Evolution a recapitulation of autopoietic theory he wrote I claim that nucleic acids do not determine hereditary and genetic phenomena in living systems and that they are involved in them like all other cellular compo nents according to the particular manner in which they integrate the struc ture of the living cell and participate in the realization of its autopoiesis23 Let us grantthat modem biology overemphasizes the role ofD N A and that DNA is as Maturana points out in this passage only one of many cellular components involved in reproduction Does he nevertheless go too far in the other direction by insisting that everything be subordinated to au topoiesis The problems created by subordinating everything to autopoiesis can be seen in The Tree of Knowledge an account of autopoiesis written for a gen eral audience24 As the opening diagram indicates Maturana and Varela envision each chapter leading into the next with the final one coming back to the beginning so that the form of the book recapitulates the circularity of autopoietic theory We shall follow a rigorous conceptual itinerary they announce in the introduction wherein every concept builds on preceding ones until the whole is an indissociable network p 9 In Autopoiesis and Cognition Maturana commented that he and Varela were unable to agree on how to contextualize the theory so he wrote the introduction by himself Now seven years later Varela is less his student and more an accomplished figure in his own right This is the last work the two men will coauthor to gether Varela has already begun to head in a different direction The di vergences in their viewpoints are accommodated through a clever visual device Certain key ideas are separated from the text and put into boxes Each box has a cartoon figure representing the speaker Maturanas figure wears heavy glasses and is noticeably older than Varelas so it is easy to iden tify which is which Sometimes Maturanas figure authorizes the boxed comments sometimes Varelas and sometimes both together Even with out the boxes it is not difficult to discern that Varelas voice is stronger in The Tree of Knowledge than in Autopoiesis and Cognition The Second Wave of Cybernetics I I take Varelas Buddhist orientation to be the inspiration behind what the authors announce as a central idea all doing is knowing and all know ing is doing p 27 They illustrate the concept by constructing the book as a circle starting their discussion with unicellular organisms first order sys tems progressing to multicellular organisms with nervous systems sec ondorder systems and finally coming to cognitively aware humans who interact through language thirdorder systems Pointing out that humans in tum are composed of cells they close the circle by nesting firstand secondorder systems within thirdorder systems thus joining the doing of autopoiesis with the knowing of eognitively aware creatures Autopoiesis is the governing idea connecting systems at all levels from the single cell to the most complex thinking being What defines living systems is their au topoietic organization and it is in this autopoietic organization that they be come real and specify themselves at the same time p 48 Traversing this path the doing of the readerthe linear turning of pages during the readingis to become a kind of knowing as the reader experiences the organization characteristic of autopoiesis through a textual structure that circles back on itself The problem comes when the authors try to articulate this circular structure together with evolutionary lineages In evolution lineage carries the sense both of continuity traced far enough back all life originates in singlecell organisms and of qualitative change different lines branch off from one another and follow separate evolutionary pathways Whereas in autopoiesis the emphaSiS falls on circular interactions in evolution lines proliferate into more lines as speciation takes place through such mecha nisms as genetic diverSity and differential rates of reproductive success The tension between evolutionary lines of descent and autopoietic circu larity becomes apparent in the authors claim that autopoiesis is conserved at every point as organisms evolve To describe the changes taking place the authors use the term natural drift There seems to be a natural drift in natural drift however and in later passages natural drift becomes structural drift If structure changes what does it mean to say that au topoiesis is conserved Here they fall back on the structureorganization distinction that they had previously used in Autopoiesis and Cognition Organization denotes those relations that must exist among the compo nents of a system for it to be a member of a specific class Structure denotes the components and relations that actually constitute a particular unity and make its organization real p 47 Interestingly they use a mechanical rather than a biolOgical analogy to illustrate the distinction A toilets parts can be made of wood or plastiC these different materials correspond to dif 52  Chapter Six ferences in structure Regardless of the material used however the toilet will still be a toilet ifit has a toilets organization The analogy is strangely in appropriate for biology All life is based on the same four nucleotides hence for living organisms it is not the material that changes but the way the material is organized What does it mean then to say that autopoiesis is conserved According to the authors it means that organization is conserved And what is organi zation Organization is those relations that must exist among the compo nents of a system for it to be a member of a specific class p 47 These definitions force one to choose between two horns of a dilemma Consider the case of an amoeba and a human Either an amoeba and a human have the same organization which would make them members of the same class in which case evolutionary lineages disappear because all living systems have the same organization or else an amoeba and a human have different organizations in which case organizationand hence autopoiesismust not have been conserved somewhere or in many places along the line The dilemma reveals the tension between the conservative circularity of autopoiesis and the linear thrust of evolution Either organization is con served and evolutionary change is effaced or organization changes and au topoiesis is effaced The strain of trying to articulate autopoiesis with evolution is perhaps most apparent in what is not said Molecular biology is scarcely mentioned and then only in contexts that underplay its importancea choice consis tent with Maturanas claim that heredity does not depend on nucleic acids There is an additional problem in bringing up molecular biology for any discussion of DNA coding would immediately reveal that the distinction between structure and organization cannot be absoluteand if this dis tinction goes autopoiesis is no longer conserved in evolutionary processes For if organization is construed to mean the biolOgical classes character ized as species then it is apparent that organization changes as speciation takes place If organization means something other than species then or ganization ceases to distinguish between different kinds of species and sim ply becomes the property of any living system Conserving organization means conserving life a fact that may be adequate for autopoiesis to qual ifY as a property ofliving systems but does nothing to articulate autopoiesis with evolutionary change The essential problem here is not primarily one of definitions although the problem becomes manifest at these sites in the text because definitions are used to anchor the argument which otherwise drifts off into such neb ulous terms as natural drift Rather the difficulties arise because of Mat The Second Wave of Cybernetics  uranas passionate desire to have something conserved in the midst of con tinuous change Leaving aside the problems with his explanation of struc ture and organization that something is basically the integrity of a selfcontained selfperpetuating system that is operationally closed to its environment In Maturanas metaphysics the system closes on itself and leaves historical contingency on the outside Even when he is concerned with the linear branching structures of evolution he turns this linearity into a circle and tries to invest it with a sense of inevitability Seen as a textual technology The Tree of Knowledge is an engine of knowledge production that vaporizes contingency by continuously circulating it within the space of its interlocking assumptions 25 Nowhere is the divergence of Varela and Maturana since 1980 clearer than on this point While Vaela moved on to other issues and ways of think ing about them Maturana continued to occupy essentially the same posi tion and to use the same language as in Autopoiesis and Cognition Clearly Maturana has a more intense and longlasting commitment to the original formulation of autopoiesis than does Varela Not COincidentally Maturana regards himself as the father of the theory whereas he sees Varelas role as more tangential In a 1991 article titled The Origin of the Theory of Au topoietic Systems he claims credit as the creator of the theory and says that Varela was very much a collaborator who appeared on the scene after the basic ideas had been formulated Strictly Francisco Varela did not contribute to the development of the notion of autopoiesis Maturana wrote This notion was developed between 1960 and 1968 Francisco was my student as an undergraduate during the years 1966 and 1967 in Santi ago then he went to Harvard where he was from 1968 to 1970 when he re turned to Chile to work with me in my laboratory in the Faculty of Sciences in Santiago Although Varelas Principles of Biological Autonomy clearly shows that Varela did most of the actual computer work in creating tessella tion automata Maturana claims credit for this idea too He wrote During the year 1972 I proposed one day to make a computer program that would generate an autopoietic system in a graphic space as the result of generat ing in that space certain elements like molecules26 In PrinCiples Varela acknowledged that Maturana was among those who have influenced this book so pervaSively that their thought was woven into it throughout but he also wrote in Describing the Logic of the Living his 1981 retrospec tive assessment of autopoiesis that the notion of autopoiesis was proposed by H umberto Maturana and myself 27 This jostling for position especially when a theory has proven to be histOrically important is of course common in almost every field and particularly in scientific communities where 154  Chapter Six great emphasis is placed on being the first to discover something I mention it here not in any way to diminish the contributions of either Maturana or Varela but to contextualize the fact that Varela moved on to other ways of thinking about autopoiesis while Maturana continued to write in much the same vein as when he had started The Voice of the Other Varela and Embodiment After The Tree of Knowledge Varela increasingly moved away from the clo sure that remains a distinctive feature of autopoiesis The change can be seen in Describing the Logic of the Living The Adequacy and Limitations of the Idea of Autopoiesis his contribution to the important 1981 collec tion edited by Milan Zeleny Autopoiesis A Theory of Living Organization While stressing that he continues to see autopoiesis as very valuable because it pointed to a neglecting of autonomy as basic to the living indi vidual Varela also criticizes autopoiesis for going both too far and not far enough p 37 It wenttoo far in his view in becoming a paradigm not just for biological organisms but for social systems as well Insisting that au topoiesis should not be confused with organizational closure in general he points out that the definition of autopoiesis has some precision because it is based on the idea of production of components and this notion of pro duction cannot be stretched indefinitely without losing all of its power pp 3738 Although cells and animals clearly do physically produce the components that instantiate their organization social systems do not De parting from Maturana on this point Varela would restrict autopoiesis to where in his view it is most applicable to the domain of cells and animals p38 Autopoiesis did not go far enough in building a bridge between its ap proach and the first wave emphasis on information flow teleology and be havior We did not take our criticism far enough to recover a nonnaive and useful role ofinformation notions in the descriptions ofliving phenomena he wrote Conceding that information coding and messages can be valid explanatory terms he suggests that they might serve as complementary modes of description for autopoiesis  p 39 Although he continues to maintain that autopoiesis is logically necessary to a complete explanation it may not be sufficient to give a satisfactory explanation oflivingphenomena on both logical and cognitive grounds p 44 There was evidently a need in Autopoiesis and Cognition to overemphasize a neglected side of a polarity p 39 To posit an analogous situation in literature imagine try ing to explain how to read a Shakespearean sonnet by starting out with a de The Second Wave of Cybernetics  scription of cellular processes Logically it is true that the behavior result ing in reading the sonnet has to originate in cellular processes but one does not need to be a literature teacher to see that a chunked higherlevel de scription would be much more useful What Varela argues for finally is a dual system of explanation The oper ational explanation would emphasize the physical concreteness of actual processes the symbolic or systemstheoretic explanation would emphasize more abstract ideas that help to construct the system at a higher level of generality Even so this duality of explanation should remain in full view as an antidote to those in computer science and systems engineering who mistake a symboliC deSCription for an operational one for example by considering that information and information processing are in the same category as matter and energy In this respect Varela remains fiercely loyal to autopoiesis To the extent that the engineering field is prescriptive by design this kind of epistemological blunder is still workable However it becomes unbearable and useless when exported from the domain of pre scription to that of deSCription of natural systems  To assume in these fields that information is some thing that is transmitted that symbols are things that can be taken at face value or that purposes and goals are made clear by the systems themselves is all it seems to me nonsense  Infor mation sensu strictu does not exist Nor do by the way the laws of nature p45 In more recent work Varela and his coauthors provide a positive di mension to this critique of disembodied information They explore the con structive role of embodiment in ways that go importantly beyond autopoiesis Although autopoietic theory implicitly privileges embodiment in its emphaSis on actual biological processes it has little to say about em bodied action as a dynamic force in an organisms development It is pre Cisely this point that is richly elaborated by Varela and his coauthors in their concept ofenaction28 Enaction sees the active engagement of an organ ism with the environment as the cornerstone of the organisms develop ment The difference in emphaSiS between enaction and autopoiesis can be seen in how the two theories understand perception Autopoietic theory sees perception as the systems response to a triggering event in the sur rounding medium Enaction by contrast emphaSizes that perception is constituted through perceptually guided actions so that movement within an environment is crucial to an organisms development As Varela further explained in Making It Concrete Before During and After Break downs enaction concurs with autopoiesis in insisting that perception must not be understood through the viewpOint of a pregiven perceiver 156  Chapter Six independent world Whereas autopoietic theory emphasizes the closure of circular processes however enaction sees the organisms active engage mentwith its surroundings as more openended and transformative A sim ilar difference informs the views of cognition in the two theories For autopoiesis cognition emerges from the recursive operation of a system representing to itself its own representations Enaction by contrast sees cognitive structures emerging from recurrent sensorymotor patterns29 Hence instead of emphasizing the circularity of autopoietic processes en action emphasizes the links of the nervous system with the sensory surfaces and motor abilities that connect the organism to the environment Embedded in the idea of enaction is also another story about what con sciousness means a story different from that articulated by autopoietic theory In The Embodied Mind Cognitive Science and Human Experience Varela and his coauthors take the Buddhistinspired point of view that the self is a story consciousness tells itself to block out the fear and panic that would ensue if human beings realized there is no essential self Opposed to the false unity and selfpresence of grasping consciousness is true aware ness which is based on actualizing within the mind an embodied realiza tion of the persons ongoing processes We saw that autopoietic theory invokes the domain of the observer as a way to integrate commonsense perceptions with the theorys epistemological radicalism a move that ended up deconstructing the liberal humanist subject in some respects but recuperating it in others By contrast in enaction consciousness is seen as a cognitive balloon that must be burst if humans are to recognize the true nature of their being The thrust of The Embodied Mind is to show that cog nitive science has already been headed in this direction and to interpret the Significance of this trajectory in the framework of Buddhist philosophies of emptiness and the notself Here the boundaries of the liberal subject are not so much penetrated stretched or dissolved as they are revealed to have been an illusion all along In contrast to the anxiety and nostalgia that Wiener and Maturana expressed when confronted with the loss of the lib eral subject Varela speaking in a voice now not conjoined with his teacher and mentor celebrates the moment when the self drops away and aware ness expands into a realization of its true nature No longer Wieners island oflife in a sea of entropy or Maturanas autonomous circularity awareness realizes itself as a part of a larger wholeunbounded empty and serene What marks this realization as something other than a mystical vision is Varelas insistence that the most advanced research in Western cognitive science points toward the same conclusion Referencing such works as R Jackendoffs Consciousness and the Computational Mind and Marvin The Second Wave of Cybernetics  Minskys Society of Mind about which we will hear more in chapter 9 he and his coauthors show that contemporary models of cognition implicitly deconstruct the notion of a unified selfby demonstrating that cognition can be modeled through discrete and semiautonomous agents Each agent runs a modular program designed to accomplish a specific activity operat ing relatively independent of the others Only when conflicts occur be tween agents does an adjudicating program kick in to resolve the problem In this model consciousness emerges as an epiphenomenon whose role it is to tell a coherent story about what is happening even though this story may have little to do with what is happening processurally These models posit the mind Varela wrote not as a unified homogenous unity nor even as a collection of entities but rather as a disunified heterogeneous collec tion ofprocesses p 100 In Making It Concrete Varela expands this line of thought by showing how Minskys society of mind model can be combined with nonlinear dy namics to give an account ofliving systems in action He continues to insist on the importance of the concrete and embodied The concrete is not a step towards anything it is howwe arrive and where we stay Reminiscent of the autopoietic theorys claim that processes happen always and only in the present he remarks that it is in the immediate present that the con crete actually lives p 98 To show how Minskys model is incomplete he points out that it is not a model of neural networks or societies it is a model of the cognitive architecture that abstracts again from neurolOgical detail and hence from the web of the living and of lived experience What is missing here he continues is the detailed link between such agents and the incarnated coupling by sensing and acting which is essential to living cognition p 99 The question he poses is how the mind can move smoothly from one agent processing its program to another agent running quite another pro gram To answer this question satisfactorily he suggests we need to link these abstractions with embodied processes He proposes a readiness to action that in effect constitutes a microidentity As an example he imag ines a man walking down the street and Varela sketches the kind ofbehav ior associated with this microidentity Suddenly the man realizes he has left his billfold behind in the last store he visited Instantly a different micro identity kicks in geared toward a search operation rather than a leisurely stroll down the street How does one get from the microidentity of stroll to the microidentity of intense search The answer Varela speculates in volves chaotic fast dynamiCS that allows emergent selforganizing struc tures to arise In linking the dynamiCS of selforganizing structures with 158  Chapter Six microidentities Varela is following a line of thought vigorously pursued by Zeleny and others who want to join autopoietic theory with the dynamics of selforganizing systems30 The idea is to supplement autopoietic theory so that it can also more adequately account for change and transformation and also to specifY the mechanisms and dynamics through which an au topoietic system progresses from one instant in the present to another These revisions aim to jog autopoietic theory out of its relentless repetitive circularity by envisioning a living organism as a fast responsive flexible and selforganizing system capable of constantly reinventing itself some times in new and surprising ways In this tum toward the new and unex pected autopoietic theory begins to look less like the homeostasis of the first wave and more like the selfevolving programs that will be discussed in chapter 9 as exemplars of thirdwave cybernetics As autopoietic theory continues to evolve what are likely to be the en during contributions of autopoiesis as Maturana originally formulated it In my view these will certainly include the follOwing his emphasis on the concreteness and specificity of embodied processes his insistence that the observer must be taken into account with all the implications this has for scientific objectivism his distinction between allopoietic and autopoietic systems and the ethical implications bound up with making this distinc tion and his insight that in a literal sense we make a world for ourselves by living it In one of his more radical moments Maturana used the insights of au topoiesis to push toward a formulation that taken out of context sounds solipsistic indeed We do not see what we do not see and what we do not see does not exist31 In context he is always careful to qualify this apparent solipsism by pointing out that a world outside the domain of one observer may exist for others as when I see a large stationary object that a frog can not perceive In this way the worlds existence is recuperated in a modified sensenot as an objectively existing reality but as a domain that is con stantly enlarging as selfconscious scientific observers operate recur Sively on their representations to generate new representations and realizations If this isnt exactly the scientific quest for new knowledge it nevertheless allows for a qualified vision of scientific progress But what if the observer ceases to be constructed as a generic marker and becomes invested with a specific psychology including highly idiosyn cratic and possibly psychotic tendencies Will the domains of self conscious observers fail to stabilize external reality Will the uncertainties then go beyond questions of epistemology and become questions of ontol ogy Will the observation that what we do not see does not exist sink deep The Second Wave of Cybernetics  into the structure of reality undermining not only our ability to know but the ability of the world to be To entertain these suppositions is to enter into the world as it is constructed in the literary imagination of Philip K Dick Writing contemporaneously with Maturana but apparently with no knowl edge of autopoietic theory Dick is obsessed with many of the same issues In turning from Maturanas radical epistemology to Dicks radical ontology we will follow our evolving stories of the reification of information the con struction of the cyborg and the emergence of the posthuman into a phan tasmagoric territory that continues to exist only as long as an observer thinks it does And what observers Dicks characters tum out to be   ch Q pre  r  se ye n TURNING REALITY INSIDE OUT AND RIGHT SIDE OUT BOUNDARY WORK IN THE MIDSIXTIES NOVELS OF PHILIP K DICK As much as any literary work in his generation Philip K Dicks fictions en act the progressively deeper penetration of cybernetic technologies into the fabric of the world For a public fascinated by the artificial lifeforms made famous in Blade Runner adapted from his most famous novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep his work demonstrates how potent the android is as an object for cultural appropriation in the late twentieth century Consistently in his fictions androids are associated with unstable boundaries between self and world The form that these associations take may be idiosyncratic but the anxieties that his texts express are not Sub terranean fears about the integrity of the subject under the cybernetic par adigm were already present in the subtext of Norbert Wieners 1948 Cybernetics as we saw in chapter 4 When system boundaries are defined by information flows and feedback loops rather than epidermal surfaces the subject becomes a system to be assembled and disassembled rather than an entity whose organic wholeness can be assumed For Humberto Maturana the problem of system definition was solved by positing a circular dynamic whereby the living continually produces and reproduces the relations constituting its organization In effect he turned first wave cybernetics inside out Instead of treating the system as a black box and focusing on feedback loops between the system and the envi ronment he treated the environment as a black box and focused on the reflexive processes that enable the system to produce itself as such He de veloped the political implications of autopoietic theory by suggesting that power struggles often take the form of an autopoietic system forcing an other system to become allopoietic so that the weaker system is made to serve the goals of the stronger rather than pursuing its own systemic unity Dicks relation to the work of Maturana and Francisco Varela is almost Turning Reality Inside Out  certainly not a case of direct influence Rather both Dick and the creators of autopoiesis were responding to the problem of incorporating the ob server into the system and as a result were experimenting with more or less radical espistemologies Without using autopoietic terminology in deed there is no evidence that he knew of it Dick explored the political dimension of androidhuman interactions in terms consistent with Matu ranas analysis In Do Androids Dream Roy Baty understands full well that androids have been denied the status of the living and consequently forced to serve as slaves rather than function as the autopoietic systems they are capable of becoming The struggle to achieve autopoietic status can be un derstood as a boundary dispute in which one tries to claim the privileged outside position of an entity that defines its own goals while forcing ones opponent to take the inside position of an allopoietic component incor porated into a larger system Working along apparently independent lines of thought Dick understood that how boundaries are constituted would be a central issue in deciding what counts as living in the late twentieth century Especially revealing are the novels he wrote from 1962 to 1966 when he popped amphetamines like crazy and channeled the released energy into an astonishingly large creative output eleven novels in one year alone in cluding a series of major works that sought to define the human by juxta posing it with artificial lifeforms 1 Drawing on the scientific literature on cybernetics Dicks narratives extend the scope of inquiry by staging con nections between cybernetics and a wide range of concerns including a devastating critique of capitalism a view of gender relations that ties to gether females and androids an idiosyncratic connection between entropy and schizophrenic delusion and a persistent suspicion that the objects sur rounding usand indeed reality itselfare fakes At the center of this extraordinarily complex traffic between cultural scientific and psycholOgical implications of cybernetiCS stands what I will call the schizoid android a multiple pun that hints at the splittings com binations and recombinations through which Dicks writing performs these complexities In Dicks fiction the schizoid functions as if autistic Typically gendered female she is often represented as a bright cold emo tionally distant woman She is characterized by a flattening of affect and an inability to feel empathy incapable of understanding others as people like herself Whether such creatures deserve to be called human or are things most appropriately classified as androids is a question that resonates throughout Dicks fictions and essays In one ofits guises then the schizoid android represents the coming together of a person who acts like a machine  Chapter Seven with a literal interpretation of that person as a machine In other instances however the android is placed in opposition to the schizoid If some hu mans can be as unfeeling as androids some androids turn out to be more feeling than humans a confusion that gives Do Androids Dream its extra ordinary depth and complexity The capacity of an android for empathy warmth and humane judgment throws into ironic relief the schizoid womans incapacity for feeling If even an android can weep for others and mourn the loss of comrades how much more unsympathetic are unfeeling humans The android is not so much a fixed symbol then as a Signifier that enacts as well as connotes the schizoid splitting into the two opposed and mutually exclusive subject positions of the human and the not human Implicated in these boundary disputes between human and android are the landscapes of Dicks midsixties novels Typically these are highly commercialized spaces in which the boundaries between autonomous in dividual and technological artifact have become increasingly permeable Circulating through them are not only highend products such an intelli gent androids but also a more general technoanimation of the landscape artificial insects that buzz around spouting commercials coffeepots that demand coins before they will begin to perk and homeostatic apartment doors that refuse to open for the tenant until fed the appropriate credit The interpellation of the individual into market relations so thoroughly defines the characters of these novels that it is impossible to think of the characters apart from the economic institutions into which they are incor porated from small family firms to transnational operations Moreover the corporation is incorporated in multiple senses emplOying people who fre quently owe to the corporation not only their economic and social identities but also the very corporeal forms that define them as physical entities from organ implants and hypertrophied brains to completely artificial bodies Given this dynamiC it is no surprise that the struggle for freedom often ex presses itself as an attempt to get outside this corporate encapsulation The ultimate horror for the individual is to remain trapped inside a world constructed by another being for the others own profit The figure of the android thus allows Dick to combine a scathing cri tique of the politics of incorporation with the psychological complexities of trying to decide who qualifies as an authentic human Gender dynamiCS is central to these complexities for when the schizoid woman is brought into close proximity with a male character he reacts to the androidism in her personality by experiencing a radical instability in the boundaries that define him and his world With the issue of what is outside someone elses inside already supercharged with psychological and political tensions Turning Reality Inside Out  these enfoldings further implicate capitalism with androidism the human with the nothuman and the technological with the ontologicalthat is cybernetics with the social political economic and psychological forma tions that define the liberal subject To unpack these complexities and re late them to the midsixties novels let us tum first to Dicks essays and biography where the genetic elements that make up these recombinant fictions can be found The Schizoid Woman and the DarkHaired Girl In How To Build a Universe That Doesnt Fall Apart Two Days Later a speech written in 1978 and first published in 1985 Dick linked the au thentic human with the real a construction that also implies its inverse Fake realities will create fake humans Or fake humans will generate fake realities and then sell them to other humans turning them eventually into forgeries of themselves2 The ontology of the human and the ontology of the world mutually construct each other When one is fake the other is con taminated by fakery as well when one is authentic the authenticity of the other is if not guaranteed at least held out as a strong possibility With so much riding on the authentic human the qualities defining it take on special significance Authenticity does not depend on whether the being in question has been manufactured or born made of flesh and blood or of electronic circuits The issue cannot be decided by phYSiolOgical cri teria Here Dick would agree with Maturana and Varela who argued that artifiCially created systems can certainly qualif as living Unlike Maturana and especially Varela however he leaps over the importance of embodi ment His fiction displays the same orientation for it shows almost no in terest in how intelligent machines are constructed dismissing the issue with a few words of handwaving explanations about homeostatic mech anisms The important point for Dick is not how intelligent machines are built but that they could be build Descriptions of bodies except those of women where the bodies serve as sexual markers also rarely appear in Dicks fiction The emphaSiS falls almost entirely on perception and think ing Without embodiment to stabilize his epistemological skeptiCism the cracks he opens in the perceiverS knowledge widen into rifts in the fabric of the world The differences between his ontological skepticism and autopoietic sta bility can be seen in how his fictions enact the human as distinct from how he defines the human in his essays In a formulation strikingly reminiscent of Maturana and Varela he suggests that the human is that which can 164  Chapter Seven create its own goal He goes on to develop other characteristics that for him set the human apart from the android being unique acting unpre dictably experiencing emotions feeling vital and alive The list reads like a compendium of qualities that the liberal humanist subject is supposed to have Yet every item on the list is brought into question by the humans and androids of Dicks fiction Human characters frequently feel dead inside and see the world around them as dead Many are incapable oflove or em pathy for other humans From the android side the confusion of bound aries is equally striking The androids and simulacra of Dicks fiction include characters who are empathic rebellious determined to define their own goals and as strongly individuated as the humans whose world they share What does this confusion signify Here I want to draw connections between Dicks biography and the fe male characters in his fiction a topic so obviously important to Dicks work that its absence from much of the criticism on Dick amounts to a scandaJ3 In The Evolution of a Vital Love Dick documents his fascination for a certain type of woman slender lithe and young younger and younger as he grew older with long dark hair Repeatedly he hooked up with such women in his life and wrote about them in his fiction He calls this type the darkhaired girl4 Although the physical type remained the same in The Evolution of a Vital Love he wrote about what he sees as a continuing development in these women and his relationships with them Whereas the first women fic tional and actual are schizoid cruel unfeeling and unempathicin short androids by his definitionlater he meets and has relationships with women who although they match the phYSical type are much warmer and more supportive of him and his goals For Dick the progression of the dark haired girl from schizoid to empathic is vitally important to defining the hu man and by implication the real To define what is real is to define what is human if you care about humans If you dont you are schizoid and like Pris a character in his novel We Can Build You and the way I see it an android that is not human and hence not real5 In Dicks reading of his life then the darkhaired girl started out being allied with the android but as time went on she became polarized against the android a stay against the unreality with which the android is perSistently linked It goes without saying I think that Dick regards himself as human Why then does he repeatedly refer to his attraction for the darkhaired girl as a programmed tropism a word he picked up from Norbert Wieners ac count of cybernetic creations such as the Moth which had build into it a tropism for light If programmed behavior marks the difference between the human and the android Dicks tropism for darkhaired girls puts him in Turning Reality Inside Out  seeks out the woman who he says evolved until she represented the authentically human These subterranean connections between the dark haired girl machine behavior and the construction of masculine subjectiv ity are explored repeatedly in the fiction through configurations that link androidism in an attractive darkhaired woman with a radical confusion of boundaries between inside and outside for a male subject The linkage also has implications for female subjectivity Replication the mark of the machine is injected back into the darkhaired girl even after she has sup posedly evolved beyond androidism because the male subjects tropism converts her into one of a series a succession of brunette women who are at once different and the samehence the multiple ambiguities of the de scriptor that Dick constructs for them the darkhaired girl The phrase points both to their singularity each takes the definite article and to their identity with one another Each is unique and uniquely remembered by Dick but remem bered as one of a repeating series that stretches back to the early stages of his erotic life Many of the critics who have written on Dicks critique of capitalism have scorned psychological explanations as iftheywere trivial or unrelated to Dicks satiric view of economic exploitation 6 But in Dicks fictional worlds psychology interpenetrates social structure Contradictions in so cial structure manifest themselves as aberrant psychology and aberrant psychology has social consequences Understanding the relation of Dicks life to his fictional constructions need not reduce his social critique to pri vate neurosis On the contrary it illuminates how he was able to fashion a syntheSiS that undermines precisely the distinctions that would keep the personal in a sanitized domain separate from the social political and eco nomic structures constituting the individual If we look for a psychological explanation for Dicks tropism its origins are not hard to find His parents were divorced when he was six and he was raised by his mother Dorothy Kindred Dick from whom he takes his mid dle name Whatever she was in fact Dick perceived her as an intellectually gifted but emotionally cold woman who denied him warmth and affection Yet he was also extremely dependent on her and maintained an emotional closeness almost incestuous in its intensity As his biographer Lawrence Sutin skillfully and senSitively shows the combination of extreme need for affection and extreme fear of rejection also marked his adult relationships especially his relationships with women 7 His anxiety toward his mother was brought into focus for him through his twin sister Jane who died at six weeks of age because Dorothy did not 166  Chapter Seven have enough milk for both infants and was too ignorant to realize that the twins already underweight at birth were becoming fatally malnourished Somehow I got all the milk Dick told his friends 8 The story of Janes death became a family legend Dick reported that Dorothy discussed it with him on several occasions trying to explain that she had done the best she could under the circumstances Her explanations ironically had the op posite effect for they vividly burned Janes existence into his consciousness and invested her with intense emotional significance As a young adult Dick developed a phobia about eating and could not consume food in pub lic as if eating were a deeply shameful act9 Despite Dorothys explanations Dick blamed his mother for Janes death seeing it as evidence of her inability to care physically and emotion ally for her children The blame was all the more intense because he must have felt that on some level he shared it having taken from Jane the milk she needed to survive He fantasized thatif Jane had lived she would have become a lovely darkhaired girl He came to believe that she was a lesbian a sexual orientation reflected in the character of Alys in Flow My Tears the Policeman Said 10 And he intuited that in some sense he continued to carry this shadowy Other within his body a figuration that reflected the fact that Jane no longer had an autonomous existence apart from his imagination of her Through no fault of her own she was fated to occupy the subordinate inside position while he the surviving twin had an outside subject po sition that made him a recognized person in the world 11 With Jane as the first darkhaired girl compounded with Dorothy from whom she could scarcely be separated in Dicks mind it is not difficult to see why the figure should be invested with so many conflicting emotional attributes Like Dorothy the darkhaired girls that Dick depicts in his fic tion are intellectually brilliant but emotionally cold capable of cutting the men around them to emotional shreds while feeling almost nothing them selves In his account of the women in his life he suggests that he was able to break away from this type of woman and find other darkhaired girls who were sympathetic These are the figures he intends to rally to his cause to help him defeat the android But his worst nightmare remains that the android will tum out to be none other than the darkhaired girl The enemy is the ally and the ally is the enemy enemy mine 12 It is no wonder that in his essays the accounts of the human and the android often seem self contradictory For the complexities this entangled he neededand usedfiction to articulate them fully Dicks distinctive gift as a writer was to combine the personal idiosyn crasies of the schizoid womandarkhaired girl configuration along with Turning Reality Inside Out  the insideoutside confusions with which it is entangled with much broader social interrogations into the insideoutside confusions of the mar ket capitalism that incorporates living beings by turning humans into ob jects at the same time that it engineers objects so that they behave like humans To explore further this complex nexus among the personal the po litical and the economic let us tum now to the fiction Capitalism and the Schizoid Android Elucidating the connection between Dicks fiction and capitalism is Carl Freedmans fine article arguing that Dicks fictional techniques reinscribe a postMarxist view of the subject13 Freedman points out that the schizohrenic subject as theorized by Lacan Deleuze Guattari and others evolves as an interplay between an alienated I and an alienating not I Under capitalism these theorists argue schizophrenia is not a psychologi cal aberration but the normal condition of the subject Freedman further argues that paranoia and conspiracy favorite Dickian themes are inherent to a social structure in which hegemonic corporations act behind the scenes to affect outcomes that the populace is led to believe are the result of de mocratic procedures Acting in secret while maintaining a democratic fa cade the corporations tend toward conspiracy and those who suspect this and resist are viewed as paranoiac Dicks novel The Simulacra seems tailormade to illustrate Freedmans point about the synergistic relation between capitalism and paranoid schiz ophrenia Set in the USEA United States of Europe and America The Simulacra depicts a capitalist society that includes Germany as one of its most powerful states Although national elections still exist the president has been reduced to a nominal figurehead der AIte The country appears to be run by the first lady Nicole Thibodeaux who takes as her husband whatever man the electorate chooses for her every four years Unbe knownst to the electorate der Alte is a simulacrum Nicole herself is re vealed to be a lookalike playing Nicole who died several years earlier and has since been played by a succession of actresses Behind Nicole is the shadowy Council whose orders she follows but even Nicole has never seen the Council Thus the entire government is a fake its real machinery hid den behind Nicoles beautiful face The presidential simulacrum far from being an anomaly serves as a metaphor for the entire political process Social classes are divided between the Ge high status and the Be low status The Signifier generating the classes is the Geheimnis the secret Those who know the secret that the government has become in Dickian tenns a giant android rather than a human institutionare the Geheim nistrager bearers of the secret in contrast to the Befahaltrager those who merely carry out instructions Thus economic distinctions merge seam lesslywith the kind of social structure that a paranoid schizophrenic might imagine when constructing a system that brings everything together into a monolithic system of explanation Paranoid schizophrenia is enacted most dramatically through the char acter of Richard Kongrosian a psionic pianist who plays his instrument without touching the keys Already unstable Kongrosian is thrown into schizophrenia when he learns that der Alte is a simulacrum The news shakes his faith in Nicole who has served as his anchor in reality a function that the darkhaired girl frequently plays for Dicks male characters He suspects that Nicole is contaminated by the android government she serves precisely the fear that haunts Dicks essays and this intrusion of an droidism tips his already fragile psyche into psychosis Something terri bles happening to me he

up Im going to have to envelop the entire universe and everything in it and the only thing thatll be outside me will be my internal organs and then most likely Ill die14 The conjunction in this scene of androidism schizophrenia and a pro found confusion of inside and outside is more than coincidence Kon grosian enacts a confusion of boundaries not unlike commodity fetishism Freedman recalls for his readers Marxs view of how commodities become fetishized under capitalism Once objects are imbued with exchange value they seem to absorb into themselves the vitality of the human relations that created them as commodities Freedman reminds us that one definition for reification is the projection of social relations onto the relations of objects The incidents that precipitate Kongrosians turning inside out suggest that the specter of the android has somehow caused this bizarre phenomenon In fact the android performs an extraordinarily complex staging of reifica tion in Dicks fiction On the one hand it is a commodity an object created by humans and sold for money In this guise it is reified in much the same Turning Reality Inside Out  69 way that any object capable of being bought and sold is reified like the ani mals that bestow high status on their human owners in Do Androids Dream or like der Alte in The Simulacra whose sole function as an object is to serve as a signifier for the democratic processes that are as fake as helit is In another sense however der Alte is an anomaly among Dicks androids for most of them  Rachael Rosen Abraham Lincoln Edwin M Stantonare shown in scenes that make them virtually indistinguishable from humans They think feel outrage bond with their fellows Given their abilities they should be able to participate in the social realm of human re lations but in such texts as Do Androids Dream they can do so legally only as objects In this view they are not objects improperly treated as if they were social beings but are social beings improperly treated as if they were objects For them the arrow of reification points painfully in both di rections The scene in which Kongrosian turns inside out is revealing in another respect as well forit demonstrates the megalomaniac expansion of self that the paranoid schizophrenic experiences in the frenzy of delirium The paranoid feels compelled to interpret all the surrounding mysterious signs and order them into a Single coherent system From here it is a small step to feeling responsible for the signs If everything that happens is the para noids responsibility the belief easily follows that the paranoid actually caused all these events When Kongrosian states Im going to have to en velop the entire universe and everything in it his actions can be under stood as a literalization of this view Gifted or cursed with telekinesis he causes things to happen in the world by thinking about them From this he moves on to believing that he orders the universe then he progresses to the fantasy that he is the universe Part of the guerrilla warfare that Dick stages on the everyday is to valorize such perceptions by rendering them as events that other characters witness and that the narrator reports as actually happening In this way the readers perceptions undergo a transformation similar to Kongrosians for our relationship to the character is turned in side out Instead of his world existing inside our minds the textual world is rendered so as to make our perceptions work as if they were part of his in ternal world The battle to occupy the external position relative to other characters is waged over and over in Dicks fiction in different guises The stakes are high for if the self is unable to expand to megalomaniac proportions it is likely to shrink so that it becomes merely a dot on the horizon an atom in a cold pitiless inanimate landscape shaped by the dead forces of cause and effect and completely unresponsive to human desire This is the tomb  Chapter Seven world the landscape in which entropy rules Frequently the pendulum will swing between dangerous hyperinflation and excruciating shrinkage of the ego without ever stabilizing at the middle position of everyday reality Scott Durham has perceptively pOinted out that this alternation be tween the expanding self and the shrinking self is intimately related to the constitution of subjectivity under capitalism 15 Capitalism encourages the inflation of desire marketing its products by seducing the consumer with power fantasies But when the realization sinks in that this is merely a capi talist ploy the subject shrinks in inverse proportion to how much it had ear lier inflated So in Dicks novel The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch ChewZ is marketed by linking it with claims of omnipotence through the slogan GOD PROMISES ETERNAL LIFE WE CAN DELIVER IT16 When the subject consumes the product figuratively and also literally by ingesting it he finds that he is catapulted into a world where Palmer Eldritch makes all the rules Rather than taking the product inside him he has been im prisoned inside the product For he soon discovers that no matter what es cape hatch he builds or invents Palmer Eldritch remains exterior to his reality determining its workings and glinting through the other characters as they begin to manifest Eldritchs telltale stigmata The eternity delivered here is precisely not the apotheosis of the liberal autonomous subject capa ble of free thought and action but is the subject as pawn in a capitalists game imprisoned for eons in a universe that a terrifYing and menacing alien other has created to increase his profits The boundary instability that the Kongrosian scene so vividly illustrates recurs repeatedly in Dicks midsixties novels In one version of the drama the male subject expands and contracts in an agonized dance between megalomania and victimization This dance is intimately bound up with a related oscillation in the attractive female character between the schizoid woman and the darkhaired girl In the promiscuous couplings these vari ous subject positions permit the android serves as an ambiguous term that simultaneously incorporates the liberal subject into the machine and chal lenges its construction in the flesh To develop further the complex con nections and disjunctions Signified by the schizoid android I tum now to pick up again the thread of the schizoid womandarkhaired girl The Schizoid Woman DeConstructs Male Subjectivity Patricia Warrick has insightfully argued that Dicks fiction is structured as a series of reversals deSigned to defeat the readers expectation that it is pos sible to discover what the situation really is17 Building on her argument Turning Reality Inside Out  and also modifying it I want to demonstrate that the reversals are not arbi trary but follow an inner lOgic of their own I shall take as my tutor text We Can Build You in part because Warrick remarks in passing that its two themesthe construction of androids and the male characters fascination with the schizoid womanare not connected with each other which she sees as an aesthetic failing I will argue that although the themes are not well integrated they are deeply connected through the figure of the schizoid android As Dick recognizes in The Evolution of a Vital Love the prototype for the schizoid woman is Pris in We Can Build You Louis Rosen the little guy who serves as protagonist for the novel finds Pris fascinating but also terri fYing Her most notable attribute is what he calls emptiness dead center an inability to feel empathy or indeed almost any emotion 18 Talented cre ative and fiercely intelligent Pris had a nervous breakdown while still in high school as did Dick himself When she takes up with the rich entre preneur Sam Barrows deserting the family firm to move in the glittering world of the rich and famous Louiss attraction to her becomes compulsive The more this darkhaired girlschizoid woman recedes out of his realm the more he yearns after her finally becoming so obsessed that getting together with her becomes more important to him than anything else including the family firm What a woman what a thing to fall in love with he thinks to himself in a conflation that makes clear that Pris as a schizoid woman has more than a touch of androidism in her It was as ifPris to me were both life itselfand antilife the dead the cruel the cutting and rending and yet also the spirit of existence itself p 155 As her new name Pris Womankind indicates she is at once uniquely herself and symbolic of the role that Dick assigned to the bright cold cutting women in his life particularly his mother Dorothy and after they divorced his fourth wife Nancy More than a tie to life Pris is Louiss anchor to reality much as Nicole was for Kongrosian in The Simulacra Atthe same time Lollis expe riences Pris as the antilife which in later novels takes shape as the tomb world The flips that Warrick notices in Dicks text have an inner logic that make it impossible for the male character to do without the darkhaired girlschizoid woman even when he sees her as a source of powerful conta mination driving him into psychOSiS When Louis and Pris rendezvous at a motel the encounter fizzles be cause neither can abandon their catandmouse games long enough to ex perience physical intimacy Still obsessed he falls into a delusional state in which he hallucinates that he is making love to her although he is alone with his father and his brother in a bedroom and his lovemaking takes place while they look on bemusingly By the novels end he traces Pris to the mental institution where she has been readmitted and he himself be comes a patient After months of drug therapy in which he hallucinates that they court marry and have a child he finally has a chance to talk with her She tells him she will soon be leaving and suggests how he can present his case to be dismissed also He wins dismissal only to learn that Pris has de ceived him I lied to you Louis she tells him Im not up for release Im much too sick I have to stay here a long time more maybe forever p 252 For Louis sanity means lOSing her and with her the vitality of life which can be seen as a kind of mental illness but having her means mental illness of another kind The ambiguity ofPriss motives in this final scenedoes she trick Louis because she doesnt want him around or because she wants him to get on with his life indicates that even in a female protagonist figured mostly as a schizoid woman Hashes of the empathic darkhaired girl still appear In Do Androids Dream these instabilities in the female subject position are exacerbated as the schizoid woman is broken into twin characters Rachael Rosen and Pris Stratton The two are the same model of android a Nexus 6 so they are physically identical But they play very different roles in the plot Rachael becomes for Deckard a particularly ambivalent version of the darkhaired girl 19 At his low point she comes to him and they end up in bed in a sexual liaison that Pris and Louis couldnt manage to bring off Dur ing this scene and the one follOwing her characterization oscillates wildly between a desirable empathic partner and a cold calculating manipulator The scenes are worth looking at in detail for what they reveal about the dynamic of the male character who experiences the schizoid woman as a splitting between an android literally so with Rachael and the darkhaired girl Deckard calls Rachael because she has offered to help him retire the escaped N exus6 androids When he shows her his hit list she turns pale because one of the androids andys Pris is the same model as she is Earlier that day Rick working with Phil Resch had helped to kill Luba Loft an escaped android who was also a superb opera singer After Deckard expressed regret at Lubas death Resch depicted as a cold blooded killer who unlike Deckard feels no empathy for Luba or any of the androids he kills interprets his regret as sexual desire Although hu manandroid sex is strictly illegal he confesses that he once fancied a fe male android and advises Deckard that instead of killing the android and then wanting her he should go to bed with her first and kill her afterward Now in the hotel room with Rachael it occurs to Deckard that he is inad Turning Realit Inside Out  vertently about to follow Reschs advice for he intends to go to bed with Rachael and kill Pris afterward Shaken by the realization he refuses to have sex with Rachael In a lastditch attempt to cajole him she tells him she loves him and then when he still refuses offers to kill Pris herself She explains I cant stand getting this close and then p 170 After the sex Rachael apparently feels free to reveal her motives She tells Deckard that his career as a bounty hunter is over because no man who has gone to bed with her has found it possible afterward to kill any androids She has had sex with several bounty hunters she explains placidly and it has worked every time The one exception is a very cynical man Phil Resch p 174 The euphemism that Deckard uses to describe killing androids retiring themironically returns in a reversal that has a female android retiring bounty hunters2o Rachaels strategy implies that she feels empa thy for her fellow androids giving the lie to the governments position that androids feel no loyalty to each other If she can care for her fellow an droids we may wonder if she also cares for Deckard as she claims when she tells him that she loves him Enraged by her revelation that she has retired him Deckard tries to kill her and cannot whereupon she reproaches him for lOving the Nubian goat he has acquired with his bounty money more than he does hera re sponse that works on multiple levels It hints at the ironic fact that humans revere animal life but feel free to kill intelligent android life and it also sug gests that Rachael although she uses Deckard for her own political pur poses cares about whether he cares for her After Deckard succeeds in killing the last three andys he returns home to discover that Rachael has pushed the goat off the roof an act that conflates her jealousy of the goat with revenge for Deckards killing her friends The mixture of human pas sion and cold calculation in Rachaels responses shows that she combines within herself attributes of the darkhaired girl and of the android The closer the relationship gets to intimacy the wilder the oscillations between these subject positions become in tum inducing alternating moods in Deckard between despair and empowerment ego shrinkage and inflation It is as if Deckards attraction to her were destabiliZing reality itself That possibility latent in Deckards relationship with Rachael becomes overt in J R Isidores perceptions Deckards desire for Rachael is formally mirrored in the plot by J Rs desire for her twin Pris Rachaels character split within itself splits again into Rachael and Pris a division in which Rachael is closer to the darkhaired girl and Pris to the schizoid woman Whereas Rachaels manipulation of Deckard is relatively subtle Priss ma nipulation ofJ R is baldfaced and cold Although J R fantasizes that per 74 I Chapter Seven haps they might have a relationship Pris never indicates any feeling for him and it is clear that sex between them isnt going to happen In We Can Build You Louis likens Pris to a spider seeing her as an alien being who goes about her business oblivious of her effects on others The image re turns in Do Androids Dream in the scene in which Pris and Irmgard Baty holed up in J Rs apartment cut off the legs of a spider which J R has found to see how many legs it can do without and still walk As a chicken head this societys term for someone who is degenerating mentally J R lacks Deckards analytical skills and he often expresses his insights visually and intuitively such as when he briefly hallucinates that Roy Baty is made of gears and coils rather than flesh and blood Faced with this desecration of Mercers decree that all life is sacred J R perceives the force of kip pie a neologism that Dick uses for the entropic decay that has been nibbling away at the apartment building suddenly becoming an avalanche of de struction Chairs crumble the table melts askew gaping holes appear in the walls From Priss exclamations the reader knows that J R has gone berserk and is causing the destruction himself Nowhere perhaps is Dicks conflation of cybernetic concerns with idiosyncratic psychology more ap parent than in this scene The entropic decay that Wiener imagined could be forestalled by cybernetics is preternaturally accelerated until it is viSibly apparent in the landscape and this visibility also functions as a sign that sys tem boundaries have become radically unstable The moment is a finely re alized piece of writing that performs cybernetic boundary disputes in a context that makes clear their relation to a male characters attachment to the female androidschizoid woman The result is a deep confusion of boundaries between inside and outside Confronted with Priss torture of the spider and thus impliCitly with her emotional coldness J R perceives the heat energy rushing from the room as if the rooms physical decay sprang directly from her lack of empathy As this conflation of insideoutside suggests his perception of the boundaries between himself and the outside world has become badly distorted The psychological dynamiC is clear from Dicks repeated use of the situation The male self yearns to expand outward in a moment of union but when the fe male androidschizoid woman rejects him the result is a devastating insta bility in which it is difficult or impossible for him to establish robust boundaries between himself and the world Louis Rosen rejected by Pris Womankind projects his fantasies of her into a hallucinatory love partner J R Isidore shocked by Pris Strattons cruelty to his spider perceives his own rampage as the impersonal force of kip pie at work In Dicks novels the sud den collapse of an insideoutside distinction is often a sign thatthe male sub Turning Reality Inside Out I 75 ject is plunging into psychosis One of the sites where this dynamic plays it self outis the tomb world Let us tum now to a closer examination of this sur realistic landscape to explore its connection with the schizoid android Wasting Time in the Tomb World In Do Androids Dream a compelling proof of the official ideology that androids occupy a category ontologically distinct from that of humans is the fact that androids cannot experience fusion with Mercer a quasireligious figure who appears when a human grips the handles of the empathy box Androids incapable of experiencing this fusion are judged to be lacking in empathy the touchstone of the authentic person Staging a moment in human history when androids rival or surpass humans intellectually Do Androids Dream shows the essential quality of the human shifting from rationality to feeling Animals evoking feeling in their owners and capable of feeling themselves occupy the privileged position of fellow creatures whose lives like human lives are sacred whereas the rational androids are denied the status of the living The change comes when nonhuman ani mals rapidly fading into extinction have ceased to pose any conceivable threat to human domination Since the real threat now comes from the an droids the shift in definition is hardly a coincidence To extend the critique Dick emphasizes the capitalist marketing of animals an industry fueled by the religious significance that owning an animal has under Mercerism Like certain forms of Puritanism Mercerism joins with capitalism to create a system in which the financially privileged merge seamlessly with the reli giously sanctified Despite this pOinted satire Dicks treatment of Mercerism remains complexly ambiguous The text refuses an eitheror choice and implies that Mercerism is both political hucksterism and a genuinely meaningful experience In an expose by Buster Friendly a radio talkshow host later re vealed to be an android Mercer is proved to be a fake a drunk hired by un known parties to act out a few cheesy scenes of humiliation and atonement on cheap sets Yet Mercer is also an inspiring figure who mysteriously ap pears to Deckard to tell him that killing androids is both wrong and neces sary just as Mercer acknowledges that he is at once fake and genuine These multiple confusions are reenacted when J R already operating in the borderland between hallucination and reality rushes to the empathy box after the tidal wave of kipple engulfs his apartment As he grabs the handles he plays out the scenario that Mercer endlessly repeats in a land scape hovering ambiguously between the internal and external worlds 176  Chapter Seven Like Sisyphus Merceris doomed to climb up a dusty hill while unseen tor mentors throw rocks at him only to slide back down when he reaches the top But he does not merely regress to the bottom He plunges all the way down into the tomb world a world where nothing but him lives a world populated by the decaying skeletons and rotting carcasses of animals In the tomb world time has either stopped or moves so slowly that its passage cannot be perceived All one can do is wait passively for what seems like eons in the utter desolation surrounded by death and decay until very slowly things begin to come alive again and it is possible to climb out A clue to the psychological significance of the tomb world comes in Dicks analysis of schizophrenia in Schizophrenia and The Book of Changes 21 In high school Dick experienced an agoraphobia so acute that he had to be tutored at home As a young man he compulsively engaged in various neurotic behaviors including his eating disorder He had three ner vous breakdowns and attempted suicide several times When he talks about the experience of mental illness therefore we may suppose he knows whereof he speaks Writing at a time when R D Laing was calling for a reassessment of schizophrenia Dick echoed Laing in viewing schizo phrenia with sympathy and even admiration22 In a letter to Patricia Warrick he wrote that he wanted to draw a sharp line between the neu rotic schizoid whom he saw as an essentially cold person seeking power over others and the psychotic schizophrenic who is too nuts to be much of a threatto anyone but himself or herself 23 In contrastto his scathing in dictment of the schizoid who withdraws emotions from the world Dick saw the schizophrenic as someone who suffers because of projecting emo tions too much into the world His sympathy is evident in The Android and the Human when he ob serves that for the schizophrenic time stops because nothing new can hap pen24 The ego has become so distended so inHated that it blocks out everything else Since the self is perceived as responsible for explaining everything and putting itinto order there can be no surprises The new the inexplicable the mysterious and the unexplained do not exist for the para noid schizophrenic The tomb world is a literary and fictional representa tion of this state seen from the point of view of the person who experiences it The dreariness the hopelessness the feeling that time has stopped and there is nothing to do but wait the deadness inside projected onto an exte rior landscapethese are the markers of extreme mental distress as Dick describes them The tomb world appears in several of Dicks fictions from the midsixties and it is always associated with a deep confusion of in sideoutside boundaries Turning Reality Inside Out  The insideoutside confusion links the schizophrenic to the android Like the schizophrenic the android is a hybrid figurepart human part machinewhose very existence calls boundaries into question Whereas the androids actions are always predictablethe android is characterized bypredictabilitymost of all Dick wrote in The Android and the Human p 191for the paranoid schizophrenic the worlds actions are always predictable In the first case the predictability is understood as coming from the androids internal programming in the second case the pre dictability is perceived as originating in the external world This distinction is moot in the tomb world however for inside and outside merge in its am biguous landscape Surely it is no accident that Dicks midsixties novels in which the tomb world prominently appears also feature android charac ters The android that Dick writes about in his essays represents the loss of free play creativity and most of all vitalityin short the triumph of ob session over the flexibility and empathy that a writer needs to create the new Yet as we have seen Dicks fictional androids are considerably more complex than this portrayal We can understand this contrast through a paradox the simple version of the android represents a loss of vitality that would make writing impossible yet this view of androidism is precisely what Dick makes into the occasion for writing Androidism both annihi lates writing and makes it possible The paradox is written into Mercerism through the ambiguities it generates between self and other The moment a human grasps the empathy box his consciousness fuses with that of un known and unnamed others He is both alone and in company cut off from his surroundings and in emotional communication with other human be ings In short he partakes of the instabilities that male subjects feel when they come into close proximity with female characters who participate in the schizoid womanandroiddarkhaired girl configuration He experi ences an ego expansion that although it can be extremely dangerous if it progresses into megalomania in the empathy box remains relatively con tained and so is relatively benign Even so the downside is hardly negligible The empathy box interpo lates the private delusions of the subject into a shared ideology that in scribes his characteristic experiences into scripts invested with religious political and social Significance As Jill Galvin points out there are hints that the government faced with a declining population in a world rapidly becoming uninhabitable by humans encourages the use of the empathy box to keep citizens quiescent and tractable 25 In the empathy box citizens feel empowered but the endless scenarios they play out make clear that 78 I Chapter Seven they are in fact powerless a paradox that is a more insidious version of Dicks empowerment by writing about the hopelessness and androidism of the tomb world Buster Friendly his ulterior motives notwithstanding makes a good point when he asks his listeners to question what it is that Mercerism does Well if were to believe its many practitioners the expe rience fuses  men and women throughout the Sol System into a Single entity But an entity which is manageable by the socalled telepathic voice of Mercer An ambitious politicallyminded wouldbe Hitler could26 Despite the obvious exploitative potential of Mercerism Dick also in sists that alongside its fakery there exists a possibility for genuine atone ment and redemption a possibility written into Do Androids Dream when Mercers intervention saves Deckards life If Mercer is in some sense real as well as fake then the tomb world must also at once be a delusion and a necessary purgation The key to understanding its mysterious double na ture lies in the schizoid womandarkhaired girl configuration As we have seen the oscillation between the darkhaired girl and the schizoid woman becomes more pronounced the closer the male character draws to her The male character nurses a fierce ambivalence toward her both desiring inti macy and fearing it Because of the multiplicity of her nature as Dick con structs it she is the perfect screen on which to project this ambivalence On the one hand she represents a rejection all the more inevitable and ab solute because it springs not from deficiencies in the male which he could presumably correct but from her own inability to relate to anyone On the other hand she represents all that the male finds desirable and vital so for him to be cut off from her is tantamount to not living If she rejects him it means he is not really alive and thus is an android If she accepts him it means he will be tied to her and thus exposed to the coldness he most fears Either way exposure to her compromises his humanity with a touch of an droidism a possibility brilliantly realized in Do Androids Dream through the intimation that Deckard himself may be an android The tomb world acknowledges this pollution and tries to atone for it Occasionally male characters who are constantly in danger of being sucked into the maelstrom of conflicting impulses that the schizoid android evokes take revenge on the woman who attracts them presumably with authorial sanction The violence that the narrator and behind him Dick can visit on the schizoid woman is revealed in the scene from The Three Stigmata in which Leo Bulero propositions his attractive assistant Roni Fugate a character who bears more than a passing resemblance to the schizoid woman When she turns him down Leo spitefully wishes she were old over one hundred years old Leo has consumed and been consumed Turning Realitv Inside Out I by ChewZ and so has never really left the space where Palmer Eldritch makes the rules Too late he remembers that in this delusional world his thoughts are coextensive with the apparently real landscape He turns around to see a spider web gray fungoid strands wrapped one around an other to form a brittle column that swayed  he saw the head sunken at the cheeks with eyes like dead spots of soft inert white slime that leaked out gummy slowmoving tears Aghast he wishes her alive again The gray mass becomes a puddle that flowed gradually outward then shuddered and retracted into itself in the center the fragments of hard gray matter swam together and cohered into a roughly shaped ball with tangled mat ted strands of hair floating at its crown Vague eyesockets empty formed it was becoming a skull but of some lifeformation to come his unconscious desire for her to experience evolution in its horrific aspect had conjured this monstrosity into being27 Two lessons emerge from this episode First is the connection between the schizoid woman and the tomb world here made explicit when the male who perceives himself insulted by her takes revenge by making her the vic tim of the tomb world dynamiCS Although he may be punished byperceiv ing the world as a dust heap the punishment he visits upon her is the more extreme violence of being made to incorporate within her own body the preternatually accelerated entropic decay of the tomb world The second lesson is the inescapability of a landscape in which the subjects inside has merged with the worlds outside Time can go forward again into life but it cant be reversed back to where it was before the psychotic episode hap pened for Leo or more drastically for Roni either Leo learns that one can climb out of the tomb world as Mercer eventually does but once one has fallen into it the tomb world itself never goes away It stays there waiting until the boundaries separating inside and outside again become so unsta ble that the subject slides down into it once more as Jack Bohlen does in Dicks novel Martian TimeSlip Given these complexities how does resolution occur in Dicks novels How are the endlessly complex splittings and recombinations of the schizoid android stabilized enough to achieve closure To answer this question I tum now to the staging of the schizoid android in his novel Dr Bloodmoney Turning RightSide Out in Dr Bloodrrwney In a brilliant article entitled After Armageddon Character Systems in Dr Bloodmoney Fredric Jameson uses the semiotic square to elucidate the relationships between characters in Dr Bloodrrwney28 His analysis posits a primary axis between organic and mechanical where the terms exist in an oppositional relation to each other The appearance of this axis is scarcely a surprise since the opposition between human and mechanical is a prominent theme in Dicks fiction Less obvious is the axis labeled contra dictory in which the terms are not opposites to the terms of the first axis but exist in a subtler relation of including realms that the first terms exclude The lowerright position is occupied by the notorganic which Jameson interprets as lacking organs that is as the dead and the lowerleft position is held by neither mechanical nor organic to which he assigns those char acters who possess extraordinary or spiritual powers such as talking ani mals and humans gifted with preternatural abilities Most of the major characters exist in positions synthesizing these four primary terms From this analysis it becomes clear that the characters are arranged according to their power over words or things a conclusion with important implications in these fictions where words are used to reveal the unreality of things and where things are used to reveal the instabilities in words In my view the only unconvincing part of Jamesons argument is the supposition he uses to launch his analysis He points out that Dr Blood rrwney shows the event that the other midsixties novels presume but do not depict the nuclear holocaust that destroys the environment and per manently changes the relation of the human race to Earth He argues that the bomb demands a flat yes or no thus defeating Dicks aesthetic of cre ating an indeterminate reality and requiring a newtechnique29 The char acter system he suggests is this new technique although how it works to solve the problem he posits is never made clear But Dick has no problem rendering the reality of the bomb problematic as we shall see shortly so from this point of view the character system is overkill I want to suggest on the contrary that the character system is more aptly understood in relation to a different interpretive problem one that I believe is central to the nar rative dynamics of Dr Bloodrrwney the boundary work of turning charac ters who are inside out rightside out The first time the bombs come the narrative makes clear that the event is actually taking place although significantly it is rendered through the eyes of Bruno Bluthgeld the Dr Bloodmoney of the title a theoretical physicist who convinced people that highaltitude nuclear tests would be safe His calculations proved tragically offbase and a generation of mal formed children were born as a result Now nine years later he goes by the name Mr Tree fantasizes that large disfiguring blotches under his skin mark him for those in the know and believes that there are massive con Turning Reality Inside Out I spiracies afoot to kill him Leaving the psychiatrist he has consulted to get rid of his infection which he construes physiologically but which the reader has no trouble recognizing as paranoid schizophrenia he sees the San Francisco street suddenly sink and tilt to the left He attributes the phenomenon to his astigmatism Sensedata so vital he thought Not merely what you perceive but how  Perhaps I have picked up a mild labyrinthitis a virus infection of the inner ear30 The monstrous incom mensurability between a minor ear infection and a nuclear holocaust reveals how out of whack are Bluthgelds perceptions Like other schizo phrenics in Dicks fiction he has experienced an inRation of ego so extreme that he believes he alone is responsible for everything that happens In his delirium he interprets the holocaust as a defensive measure he was forced to take to punish those conspiring against him In contrast to this first scene is the second holocaust more shadowy than real Bluthgeld now living as Mr Tree in a postnuclear society on the Marin headlands grotesquely decides that the conspiracy against him has been reactivated when Stuart McConchie arrives in the community In the afterword to Dr Bloodrrwney Dick identified McConchie an African American as representing his own viewpoint within the novel Alarmed by this fantasized conspiracy BluthgeldMr Tree concentrates on reactivat ing the destructive forces that will drop the bombs The second time around it is not so easy for us to decide the ontological status of the bomb Since many of Mr Trees other fantasies obviously dont work the reader may be tempted to dismiss his calling forth the bomb as a private delusion But other characters corroborate that some version of a nuclear hit is taking place although exactly in what sense is not clear The most important of these corroborations is the viewpoint of Walt Dangerfield a wouldbe Martian emigre trapped in a satellite after war broke out From high over Earth Dangerfield sees on the horizon a Rash that he thinks he recognizes from the holocaust nine years earlier Seconds passed and there were no further explOSions And the one he had seen it had been peculiarly vague and shadowy with a diffuseness that had made it seem somehow unreal as ifitwas only imagined p 230 Thus Dick constructs the event so it hovers suspended between internal fantasy and exterior corroboration using much the same multifocal narrative techniques that operate in his other novels Whatever the purpose of the character system its object cannot be to infect the holocaust with ontological uncertainty for Dick accomplishes this by other means So what does the character system accomplish As I suggested earlier I believe it is directed toward the different problem of how to escape be coming trapped in the inside of a p owe rmad fantasy and how to tum the world rightside out again Jameson rightly notices that Dick runs into a problem when he tries to defeat violent characters by using characters still more violent for the cure quickly becomes worse than the disease Exactly this problem arises in Dr Bloodrrwney When Mr Tree goes crazy and starts setting off bombs again Hoppy a phocomelus born with no legs with flippers for arms and with fearsome telekinetic powers saves himself and incidentally the town by killing Mr Tree tossing Mr Tree high into the air by using his telekinetic powers But Hoppy has a growing megalo mania akin to that of Bluthgeld Drunk with his powers he has no empathy for anyone else and has such an inflated ego that only his own needs and de sires are real to him Moreover his reach extends beyond the town He has been preparing himself to become the worlds dictator by using telekinesis to kill Walt Dangerfield and take over his satellite broadcasts which have hitherto provided the one bright spot in an otherwise dark world Like Mr Tree Hoppywants to locate others inside his fantasy and arrange matters so that others are forced to live there on his terms The resolution comes from another direction entirely Opposing Hoppy and Mr Tree is Edie Keller a young girl who carries the homunculus of her twin brother Bill who formed inside her body when they were in the womb and communicates with her telepathically No doubt her characterization reflects Dicks belief that he carried the spirit of Jane inside his body Edie and Bill are Dick and Jane turned inside out Whereas Mr Tree and Hoppy are completely narcissistic the confusion of boundaries that Bill and Edie experience includes genuine concern for each other Bills greatest hope is that he can exit Edies body and live on his own rather than vicariously through her reports to him Although Edie can be thoughtless and cruel she also tries earnestly to find a suitable home for him When she hears that Mr Tree has gone crazy she hurries to him reasoning that Bill will make better use of Mr Trees body But Hoppy kills Mr Tree before she can reach him Her next plan is to trick Hoppy into allowing her to get close to him so that Bill can expropriate Hoppys body But Hoppy telepathic as well as telekinetic takes Bill out of her body before she can reach the phocomelus he tosses Bills tiny malformed body into the air as he did with Bluthgeld Bill however has authorial resources that Bluthgeld lacked Tongue in cheek Dick uses an avis ex rnachina to rescue Bill Bill succeeds in ex changing bodies with Hoppy seconds before the homunculus body dies In contrast to Hoppys megalomania Bills aspirations are modest Although Hoppys body is severely deformed it is so superior to Bills previous body that he is delighted with it for now he can see and hear on his own Thus the Turning Realiry Inside Our  insideoutside confusion is resolved in two ways Bluthgeld and Hoppy the characters who threatened to expand until others were condemned to live in the inside of their horrific mental worlds are killed and Bill and Edie innocents who through no fault of their own were caught in a tragic encap sulation that threatened both their lives are turned rightside out The happy conclusion reverses the tragic end of Dick and Janes twinship In stead of two children becoming one when the girl twin dies here one child becomes two when the boy twin succeeds in leaving his sisters body and liv ing on his own Why can this accommodation be achieved in Dr Bloodmoney when it eludes the other midsixties novels with their darker endings Central to this extremely hopeful novel Dicks phrase in the afterword p 300 is the characterization of Bonny Keller who remains largely outside J arne sons semiotic square Depicted as a beautiful woman Bonny is one of the very few attractive females who is neither fetishized as the darkhaired girl nor feared as the schizoid woman in Dicks fiction Her deepest allegiance seems to be toward living life as fully honestly and joyfully as pOSSible The day the bombs fall her immediate reaction is to make love with the first man who comes along Andrew Gill as if to affirm that life can still go on As a result Edie and Bill are conceived As if to confirm that she is emphatic as well as lifeaffirming her next reaction is to weep for all the people who have died in the city Bonnys moment of truth comes Significantly when she refuses to take responsibility any longer for Bluthgelds madness Throughout the years she has tried to protect him and even to reason with him but when his mad ness breaks through again she leaves him to his folly She has a similar re action when Hoppy starts terrorizing the town Rather than fight him she intends to get as far away as pOSSible Somehow her shrugging off these self aSSigned responsibilities comes across as the right thing to do even though it means leaving her children behind Talking with Dr Stockwell Bill won ders what his mother will think when she realizes she has twins rather than a Single child But he and his sister never find out for Bonny has already run off with Andrew Gill The Gordian knot formed by the tangled complexi ties of mothers who cannot properly care for their children of twins whose lives enmesh with disastrous results and of vicious circles that form when a male character both desires and fears the darkhaired girlschizoid woman is Simply cut through by a knifelike clarity that says in effect This

enfolded twin boy and girl the choice for life over futile self assigned and selfdefeating responsibilitiesthese are the entwined com plexities that the elaborate textual machinery of the character system is designed to straighten out More so than other texts from this period with the possible exception of Martian TimeSlip Dr Bloodrrwney succeeds in cutting through the entanglements figured by schizoid android As Dick moved out of the midsixties era the frequency with which the darkhaired girlschizoid woman appears in his fiction diminishes Ubik written at the outer range of this period in 1966 functions as an interesting transitional text for it suggests that Dick was able to resolve the deep ambi guities of the darkhaired girlschizoid woman configuration through his writing Structured as a series of revelations each of which exposes its pre decessor as a facade rather than an authentic reality Ubik uses this favorite Dickian technique to suggest that the darkhaired girlschizoid woman configuration is itself merely a facade underlaid by a deeper reality To see how Dick achieves this psychological resolution let us turn now to this complexly reflexive text DarkHaired GirlSchizoid Woman as Facade The Reality Underneath In Ubik the struggle to occupy an outside relative to someone elses in side takes place on multiple levels The little guy of the novel Joe Chip works for Glen Runciter head of a prudence organization that specializes in antipsis who can neutralize the psionic talents of telepaths precogs and the like Lured to Luna by a business rival Glen Runciter Joe Chip and a group of their antipsis are hit by a bomb What happens afterward is notOriously unclear For a while Joe believes that Glen has been fatally in jured and he and his team rush back to Earth to put Glen in cryogenic sus pension where the little life force that remains can be stretched out into several years of half life in a moratorium a neologism that points toward the liminal state that halflifers occupy as they hover suspended between life and death No sooner does Joe return to Earth however than he finds the world around him manifesting preternaturally rapid decay Unlike ear lier protagonists who accepted the tomb world as reality Joe puzzles over Turning Reality Inside Out  where the boundaries between inside and outside should be drawn It is nt the universe which is being entombed he thinks All this is going on within me and yet I seem to see it outside  Is the whole world inside me Engulfed by my body31 The mystery seems to clear when he re ceives messages inscribed on various mediarecorded telephone calls matchbook covers parking citations bathroom graffitiimplying that it was he and his team who were fatally injured in the explosion In this ver sion of reality Runciter is outside in a moratorium trying to communicate with those inside the world of dreaming halflifers Although this explanation may account for the messages Joe does not understand how it relates to the decay and regression which soon attack people as well as objects The woman he aspires to marry Wendy Wright who at first looks so durable that he cant imagine her agingshe had too much control over herself and outside reality for that p 55he later finds desiccated in his closet a huddled heap dehydrated almost mum mified p 90 He suspects that the culprit causing this disastrous intrusion of the entropic tomb world into his reality is Pat Conley a dev astatingly attractive woman with a lithe body telltale dark eyes and long black hair p 31 Pat is particularly dangerous because she can change what happened in the past thus creating a different present and more over a present that other people do not realize is not the same present as the one they were living in a moment ago After several members of Joes party turn into desiccated heaps the decay attacks him As he crawls up the stairs to his room heroically struggling so that he can die in decent privacy Pat taunts him and gloats over his imminent demise revealing herself as a particularly vicious instantiation of the schizoid woman The thing we call Pat Joe Significantly names her in this moment of confrontation p 159 Yet this signing of the darkhaired girl as an android a spectacle that in ear lier texts had proved so obseSSively engrossing that it derailed the plot wit ness We Can Build You here is revealed as a mere facade behind which stands a more authentic reality The real culprit responsible for the desic cation Joe discovers is not Pat but the teenage Jory characterized princi pally by his voracious appetite for life Condemned to halflife while still an adolescent Jory maintains his crude but vibrant vitality by feeding on the life force of halflifers weaker than himself I eat their life what remains of it Jory tells Joe Chip when he is exposed I need a lot of them 1 used to wait until they had been in halflife awhile but now 1 have to have them im mediately p 174 If part of Dicks fascination with the schizoid womandarkhaired girl comes from his guilt over Janes death Jorys unveiling moves toward un 186  Chapter Seven tangling the complexities of the darkhaired girlschizoid android configu ration for it brings into view the child who performs the fantasized act of eating what others need to survive The Hat horror that attends J orys canni balistic appetite recalls Dicks teenage phobia of eating in public When Joe hears that Jory consumes his victims he recoils in horror How do you mean ate Literally he wondered his Hesh undulating with aversion the gross physical motion rolled through him engulfing him as ifhis body wanted to shrink away p 173 He learns firsthand what J ory does when the youngster leaps at him Even though the perceived actions must be happening symbolically rather than literally in halflife each person is cryogenically suspended in his or her individual container so physical as sault is impossible the description of the attack is vividly animalistic and horrific Snarling Jory bit him The great shovel teeth fastened into Joes right hand They hung on as meanwhile Jory raised his head lifting Joes hand with his jaw J ory stared at him with unwinking eyes snoring wetly as he tried to close his jaws pp 17576 The intensity of Dicks revulsion here is unmistakable Nevertheless J ory finds a measure of absolution as if Dick recognized that J ory is only do ingwhat he must to survive Ella Runciter Glens wife who entered halflife at age twentytwo and who is described as pretty lightskinned and blueeyed in the tradition of Bonny Keller acts like the mother that Dick might have wished he had She insists God knows I detest Jory But she also accepts Jory and his kind as a condition oflife seeing his preying on others as a verity a rule of our kind oflife She urges Joe to come to terms with J orys predation insisting that moving to a new site wont help because there are Jorys in every moratorium When Joe insists that he wants to defeat Jory she cautions I doubt if you can truly destroy himin other words consume himas he does to halflifers placed near him in the mora torium p 183 The language makes clear that consuming the predator cannot be a final solution for the only way to achieve this illusory closure is by taking the predator inside thus symbolically and literally becoming a predator oneself As in Dicks other novels from this period the psychological interpene trates the social and the economic It comes as no surprise then that Jorys appetite is also linked with the relentless capitalism that preempts the be ginning of each chapter with a commercial for Ubik When Joe asks Ella why Jory cant simply be phYSically removed from proximity with the half lifers he preys on she replies Herbert the moratorium owner is paid a great deal of money annually by Jorys family to keep him with the others and to think up plaUSible reasons for doing so p 183 In the commercials Turning Realitv Inside Out  that selVe as epigraphs for the chapters Ubik signifies all manner of capi talist predation from used cars to foods accompanied by the ominous dis claimer Safe when used as directed As in Dr Bloodrrwney resolution of a personal crisis is mysteriously linked with the redemption of capitalism even though resolution in the economic sphere is not logically motivated in the plot Thus when J OJ is revealed and accepted as an inevitability the meaning of Ubik is mysteriously changed as well In the final epigraph we find the following proclamation I am Ubik Before the universe was I am  I cre ated the lives and the places they inhabit I move them here I put them there They go as I say they do as I tell them  I am called Ubik but that is not my name I am I shall always be p 190 When Joe Chip discovers Ella as the force opposingJory and muses Ive reached the last entities in volved she replies caustically I dont think of myself as an entity I usu ally think of myself as Ella Runciter p 182 Now the unlocatable voice speaking the epigraph seems to reveal itself as the final entity To my knowledge no one has attempted to explain why Ubik changes from signi fying the worst excesses of capitalism to standing for a ubiquitous God Many critics even suggest that Ubik has somehow really been God all along I want to suggest that on the contrary Ubik undergoes a sudden transformation and that this transformation cannot be understood except in relation to the revelation that behind Pat stands Jory and behind Jory stands his animalistic appetite Only after acknowledging this appetite which must be understood as operating on the multiple levels Signified by consuming can the author discern among the trashy surfaces of capital ist excess the divine within the worldand by implication within himself For ifUbikis intended to signifY an ultimate authentic reality it can do so only from a perspective inside the text Outside the text let us suppose Derrida notwithstanding that we can imagine such a vantage Ubik must be none other than Philip K Dick It is ultimately Dick who created the lives and the places the characters inhabit who put them there in this text Confused about where Ubik comes from Joe at first assumes that Runciter has smuggled it to him but Jory insists that no objects can come into the halflife world from the outside only words The distinction be tween words and things encoded into the character system of Dr Blood money is here invoked to remind us of the difference between resolution in fictional worlds where writing has efficacy only in the performative realm of symbolic action and resolution in the real world where the materiality of things is often stubbornly resistant to verbal intelVentions This split be tween words and things maps onto the split in Dicks life between past and 188  Chaprer Seven present sedimented psychological formation and present active intention Ifhe is writing his way toward resolving deep conflicts in his life he can do so through words that have only a mediated and uncertain relation to the ghosts inhabiting his psyche As a writer he passes messages through his fiction into his own heart of darkness hoping that somehow they might prove efficacious Within the world of the text the murmurs the halflifers hear from the world outside trope this situation for no things can pass be tween inside and outside only words Joe Chip seems to comment on this aspect of Dicks writing when he remarks from his perspective in half life We are served by organic ghosts  who speaking and writing pass through this our new environment Watching wise phYSical ghosts from the fulllife world elements of which have become for us invading but agreeable splinters of a substance that pulsates like a former heart pp18889 Ubiks distinctive achievement is to represent Simultaneously the per formative power oflanguage and the mediated uncertain relation oflan guage to the material world while also mapping this difference onto an inside outside boundary that hints at the complexity of communication between self and other conscious and unconscious The hope Ubik holds out is that although boundary disputes will never disappear inside and out side can be made to touch each other through the medium of a writing that is no less valuable for infecting our world with all manner of epistemologi cal and ontolOgical instabilities Punctuating the Endless Regress of Reflexivity Like Maturana and Varela Dick is a system builder He takes seriously an idea they also propose follOwing SpencerBrown thatthe observer cre ates a system by drawing a distinction between inside and outside For Maturana and Varela this move introduced certain instabilities into the foundation of their system instabilities that they sought to fix by locating the formation of the system boundaries in reality as such For Dick such instabilities have potentially deadly consequences as subjects struggle to define boundaries that are outside relative to others inside Consis tent with their base in the biological sciences Maturana and Varela tend to assume rational observers The observer they posit is the kind of ob server who sits in a laboratory watching an instrument dial Granting con structive power to the observer may be epistemolOgically radical but it is not necessarily politically or psychologically radical for the rational ob server can be assumed to exercise restraint Dick makes no such assump Turning Realiry Inside Our  tion His conclusions are darker and more psychologically complex be cause he is acutely aware of cases in which the stability of the observing mind cannot be assumed especially when the act of creating a world may stimulate an already insatiable appetite for power and selfexpansion Thus Dick uses the inclusion of the observer to opposite effect Whereas Maturana and Varela use the domain of the observer to recuperate everyday notions like cause and effect Dick uses it to estrange further consensus reality Similarly Dick shares with secondwave cybernetics an emphasis on re flexivity though he changes its use and intent Maturana sought to rescue the reflexivity inherent in autopoiesis from an infinite regress by asserting We do not see what we do not see and what we do not see does not exist 32 The infinite regress of observers watching other observers is thus con tained for the reflexive spiral does not continue past the boundaries of the observer Sharing Maturanas passion for systems Dick used a different strategy Instead of bracketing reality he turned to the creation of ever more inclusive systems His most ambitious attempt at system creation sprang from a series of visionary experiences he had in February and March of 1974 dates that he abbreviated as 2374 To explain these experiences he wrote a vast tract entitled Exegesis that ran to more than three thou sand pages in length selections of which have been published There is a possible phYSiological explanation skeptically entertained by Dicks biographer Lawrence Sutin and embraced by others for the visions of 237433 Within eight years Dick would die of a massive stroke and throughout this period he had extreme hypertension The visions he expe rienced are consistent with symptoms experienced by people who have had small strokes in the brain which can stimulate the auditory centers and cause hallucinations Dick himself was skeptical of the visions and enter tained numerous hypotheses about them As if to make good Maturanas as sertion that there can be no difference between a hallucination and reality for one who experiences the hallucination34 Dick finally concluded that the most likely explanation was that he had been contacted by an extrater restrial intelligence he called the Vast Active Living Intelligent System or VALIS the subject of a final trilogy of novels that are among the best of his fiction On November 17 1980 he had another visionary experience in which he believed God contacted him directly For Dick the contact solved the problem of infinite regress that inevitably haunts reflexive con structions Wherever a regress appeared the voice claimed that Dick had encountered the infinite therefore the divine therefore God Here is Dicks account of the experience as it is recorded in ExegeSis God said I am the infinite 1 will show you Where 1 am infinity is where in finity is there 1 am Construct lines of reasoning by which to understand your experience in 1974 1 will enter the field against their shifting nature You think they are lOgical but they are not they are infinitely creative came into being God said Here 1 am here is infinity 1 thought another ex planation again an infinite series of thoughts split off in dialectical antithetical interaction God said Here is infinity here I am35 For Dick the construction of the observer cannot finally be separated from the construction of reality Both end at the same point in infinite regresses that for mystical reasons he chose to call God rather than a Maturanian re ality that remains outside the compass of human knowing In this way Dick constructs an outside authorized with the name of God and made invul nerable by continuing to infinity an outside that is safe from being coopted and forced to become an inside The irony of course is that this very con struction may itself have been precipitated by a physical event inside his brain In contrast to the ambitious system building that Dick undertook in re sponse to the visions of 2374 his fiction of the midsixties tends toward a different kind of affirmation one that I find more appealing It can be illus trated by the ending of Do Androids Dream After Deckard succeeds in killing the last three androids on his list and returns home to find out that Rachael has pushed his beloved goat off the roof he is so exhausted and de moralized that he heads for the desolate country north of San Francisco where no living thing would go Not unless it felt thatthe end had come36 There he has a visionary experience Hundreds of miles from his govern ment sanctioned empathy box he feels a rock hit him as he stands on top of a dead hill as ifhe were enacting Mercers endless scenario Panicked he calls the office on the car phone and tells his secretary Im Wilbur Mercer Ive permanently fused with him And I cant unfuse p 207 Here the ex pansion of the ego comes not from megalomania but from suffering and in ner conflict a result of the empathy that Deckard has increasingly come to feel for the androids Psychologically if not intellectually he has refused the distinctions that make androids fair game for bounty hunters The fusion experience ends only when he spies a toad an animal sacred to Mercer halfburied in the lifeless dust Awed by his discovery he takes it as a sign that he is meant to go on living When he returns home to Iran his wife and shows her the toad she dis covers the trap door hidden in its belly It is electrical like the ersatz sheep Turning Reality Inside Out I with which he tried to fool his neighbors The sign is a delusion the miracle is a fake But this ironic tum is not quite the end He tells Iran that the delu sion doesnt matter The electric things have their lives too PaltI as those lives are p 214 When Iran tells him to dial Long deserved peace on the mood organ he agrees but falls asleep without it finding peace without needing a cybernetic benediction She then orders artificial flies for the electric toad to eat showing a tenderness toward her husband that was notably lacking at the beginning of the novel Although nothing has hap pened to explain how she moved from bitterness to tenderness it is as if Deckards struggle with the schizoid android has somehow resolved ten sions in their relationship as well The symbolic way in which resolution oc curs emphasizes that no big problems are solved here Only a modest accommodation has been reached infused with multiple ironies that em phasizes survival and the mixed condition of humans who are at their best when they show tolerance and affection for the creatures biological and mechanical with whom they share the planet One could do worse than to accept this as a fitting conclusion to the deep epistemological and ethical problems that secondwave cybernetics raised but did not conclusively solve  Chap  ter  fIgh  t THE MATERIALITY OF INFORMATICS Every epoch has beliefs widely accepted by contemporaries that appear fantastic to later generations Of such are New Historical studies made with good reason for understanding the constellation of practices meta phors and presuppositions that underlie apparently bizarre beliefs opens a window onto a cultures ideology One contemporary belieflikelyto stupefY future generations is the postmodern orthodoxy that the body is primarily if not entirely a linguistic and discursive construction Coincident with cybernetiC developments that stripped information of its body were discursive analyses within the humanities especially the archaeology of knowledge pioneered by Michel Foucault that saw the body as a play of discourse systems Although researchers in the physical and human sci ences acknowledged the importance of materiality in different ways they nevertheless collaborated in creating the postmodem ideology that the bodys materiality is secondary to the lOgical or semiotic structures it en codes It is not difficult to find pronouncements supporting an ideology of dis embodiment in cultural theory no less than in cybernetiCS Consider for example the follOwing claims The human body our body seems super fluous in its proper expanse in the complexity and multiplicity ofits organs of its tissue and functions because today everything is concentrated in the brain and the genetic code which alone sum up the operational definition of being Jean Baudrillard wrote in The Ecstasy of Communication l Arthur Kroker and Marilouise Kraker out Baudrillard Baudrillard in Body Invaders Panic Sex in America imagining secondorder simulacra and floating body parts that herald the disappearance of the body into a fluid and changing display of signs If today there can be such an intense fasci nation with the fate of the body might this not be because the body no 19 2 The Materiality of Informatics  longer exists they ask in what they evidently believe is a rhetorical ques tion They count the ways the body is disappearing ideologically into the signs of fashion epistemologically as the Cartesian consciousness guaran teeing its existence falls apart that grisly and false sense of subjectivity semiotically into tattoos and floating signs and technologically into ultra refuse and hyperfunctionality2 O B Hardison concludes his disap pearing act by writing the body into computers He penSively observes N 0 matter what precautions are taken no matter how lucky the body is in the end it betrays itself Echoing Hans Moravec he imagines the relation between carbon man and the silicon devices he is creating to be like the relation between the caterpillar and the iridescent winged creature that the caterpillar unconSCiously prepares to become3 How can we account for these ecstatic pronouncements and delirious dreams As I suggested in chapters 1 and 2 I believe they should be taken as evidence not that the body has disappeared but that a certain kind of sub jectivity has emerged This subjectivity is constituted by the crossing of the materiality of informatics with the immateriality of information4 The very theorists who most emphatically claim that the body is disappearing also operate within material and cultural circumstances that make the claim for the bodys disappearance seem plausible The bodys dematerialization de pends in complex and highly speCific ways on the embodied circumstances that an ideology of dematerialization would obscure Excavating these con nections requires a way of talking about the body responsive to its con struction as discourselinformation and yet not trapped within it This chapter suggests a new more flexible framework in which to think about embodiment in an age of virtuality This framework comprises two dynam ically interacting polarities The first polarity unfolds as an interplay be tween the body as a cultural construct and the experiences of embodiment that individual people within a culture feel and articulate The second po larity can be understood as a dance between inscribing and incorporating practices Since the body and embodiment inscription and incorporation are in constant interaction the distinctions forming these polarities are heuristic rather than absolute They nevertheless play an important role in understanding the connections between an ideology of immateriality and the material conditions that produce the ideology Thus one purpose of this chapter is to develop a theoretical framework to integrate the two camps of abstraction and embodiment that have been sitting uneasily side by side since my discussion of the Macy Conferences A second purpose is to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework for reading texts William BurroughsS The Ticket That Exploded serves as my example in part because Burroughs turns the tables on those who advocate disembodiment Instead of discourse dematerializing the body in Ticket the body materializes discourse Situating this text in the high technology for its time of magnetic taperecording I demonstrate how the theoreti cal framework can be used to foreground embodiment while still being at tentive to the complexities of representational codes To prepare the ground for these discussions let us tum now to a brief consideration of Foucaults archaeology and its treatment of embodiment Foucaults Archaeology and the Erasure of Embodiment Acknowledging thatthe Panopticon was never built Foucault nevertheless argues that it must not be understood as a dream building it is the diagram of a mechanism of power reduced to its ideal form its functioning ab stracted from any obstacle resistance or friction must be represented as a pure architectural and optical system it is in fact a figure of political tech nologythat may and must be detached from any specific use5 On the one hand the abstraction of the Panopticon beyond any obstacle resistance or friction into a system of diSciplines dispersed throughout society gives Foucaults analysis its power and universality On the other hand it diverts attention away from how actual bodies in their cultural and phYSical speci ficities impose incorporate and resist incorporation of the material prac tices he describes It is not coincidental that the Panopticon abstracts power out of the bod ies of disciplinarians into a universal disembodied gaze On the contrary it is precisely this move that gives the Panopticon its force for when the bod ies of the diSciplinarians seem to disappear into the technology the limita tions of corporeality are hidden Although the bodies of the diSciplined do not disappear in Foucaults account the specificities of their corporealities fade into the technology as well becoming a universalized body worked upon in a uniform way by surveillance techniques and practices When ac tual situations involving embodied agents are considered limits appear that are obscured when the Panopticon is considered only as an abstract mechanism Failing to recognize these limits Foucaults analysis rein scribes as well as challenges the presuppositions of the Panoptic society Foucault thus participates in as well as deconstructs the Panoptic move of disembodiment Exposing the assumptions underlying Panoptic society his analysis also fetishistically reconstructs them by positing a body consti tuted through discursive formations and material practices that erase the contextual enactments embodiment always entails6 A useful antidote to The MaterialilY of Informatics  this view is Elaine Scarrys study of torture in The Body in Pain The Making and Unmaking of the World 7 Like Foucault Scarry interrogates the cul tural assumptions and political purposes that underlie the use of torture also like Foucault when she talks about assaults on the body she uses rep resentations to bring them into the realm of discourse what other choice could there be But unlike Foucaults discussions her representations are crafted to emphaSize that bodily practices have a physical reality that can never be fully assimilated into discourse Although the absorption of embodiment into discourse imparts inter pretive power to Foucault it also limits his analysis in Significant ways Many commentators have criticized the universality of the Foucaultian body this universality is a direct result of concentrating on discourse rather than embodiment Fissuring along lines of class gender race and privi lege embodied practices create heterogeneous spaces even when the dis cursive formations describing those practices seem uniformly dispersed throughout the society The assimilation of embodiment into discourse has the additional disadvantage of making it difficult to understand exactly how certain practices spread through a society Foucault delineates the trans formations that occurred when corporeal punishment gave way to surveil lance but the engine driving these changes remains obscure Focusing on embodiment would help to clarify the mechanisms of change for it links a changing technological landscape with the instantiated enactments that create feedback loops between materiality and discourse Building on Foucaults work while going beyond it requires understanding how em bodiment moves in conjunction with inscription technology and ideology Attentive to discursive constructions such an analysiS would also examine how embodied humans interact with the material conditions in which they are placed Elizabeth Grosz makes a good start in her valuable study Volatile Bodies Toward a Corporeal Feminism 9 She argues that the mindbody split pervasive in the Western tradition is so bound up with philosophical thinking that philosophy literally cannot conceive of itself as having a body Philosophy has always considered itself a diSCipline concerned primarily or exclUSively vith ideas concepts reason judgment that is ith terms clearly framed by the concept of mind terms which marginalize or exclude considerations of the body p 4 Even those philosophers who do take embodiment seriously tend unreflectingly to take the male body as the norm as Grosz shows in discussing a range of theorists including Merleau Ponty Freud Lacan Nietzsche Foucault and Deleuze and Guattari Reading these male writers to find resources for a feminist understanding of embodiment she offers as a model a Mobius strip in which outside be comes inside becomes outside The attraction of the model for her is that it undercuts dichotomies by having one tum into the other So she structures her book by first showing how models of the psyche produce the body the inside out and then how the body produces the psyche the outside in En route to this analysis she makes an important observation Indeed there is no body as such there are only bodiesmale or female black brown white large or smalland the gradations in between Bodies can be represented or understood not as entities in themselves or simply on a linear continuum with its polar extremes occupied by male and female bodies  but as a field a twodimensional continuum in which race and possibly even class caste or religion form body specifications p 19 Al though I am fully sympathetic with Groszs project the Mobius strip model has limitations as she recognizes pp 20910 In particular the imper ceptible transformations of insideoutside make it difficult to chart grada tions within the continuum It seems to me that the field in which bodies take shape may profitably be represented as an interplay between two in tersecting axes The polarities defining the end points of the axes acknowl edge the historical importance of dichotomies but the field itself is generated by the interplay between these end points To delineate this field let me begin by clarifying what I mean byembod iment an understanding that aligns itself with Groszs comment that there is no body as such there are only bodies Embodiment differs from the concept of the body in thatthe body is always normative relative to some set of criteria To explore how the body is constructed within Renaissance medical discourse for example is to investigate the normative assump tions used to constitute a particular kind of social and discursive concept Normalization can also take place with someones particular experiences of embodiment converting the heterogeneous flux of perception into a rei fied stable object In contemporary scientific visualization technologies such as positronemission tomography PET for example embodiment is converted into a body through imaging technologies that create a normal ized construct averaged over many data pOints to give an idealized version of the object in question 10 In contrast to the body embodiment is contex tual enmeshed within the specifics of place time phYSiology and culture which together compose enactment Embodiment never coincides exactly with the body however that normalized concept is understood Whereas the body is an idealized form that gestures toward a Platonic reality em bodiment is the specific instantiation generated from the noise of differ ence Relative to the body embodiment is other and elsewhere at once The Materiality of Informatics I excessive and deficient in its infinite variations particularities and abnor malities During any given period experiences of embodiment are in continual interaction with constructions of the body Consider for example the stress put on the vaginal orgasm during the early part of the twentieth cen tury across a range of cultural sites from Freudian psychoanalysis to the novels of D H Lawrence Womens experiences of embodiment inter acted with this concept in a variety of ways Some women disciplined their experiences to bring them into line with the concept others registered their experiences as defective because they were other than the concept still others were skeptical about the concept because it did not match their experiences Experiences of embodiment far from existing apart from cul ture are always already imbricated within it Yet because embodiment is individually articulated there is also at least an incipient tension between it and hegemonic cultural constructs Embodiment is thus inherently desta bilizing with respect to the body for at any time this tension can widen into a perceived disparity Foucault is not exceptional in focUSing on the body rather than embodi ment Most theorists who write on corporeality make the same choice for theory by its nature seeks to articulate general patterns and overall trends rather than individual instantiations Theorieslike numbers require acer tain level of abstraction and generality to work A theory that did not gener alize would be like the number scheme that Jorge Luis Borges imagines in Funes the Memoriousll Funes blessed or cursed by a head injury that enables him to remember each sensation and thought in all its particularity and uniqueness proposes that each number be aSSigned a unique nonsys tematic name bearing no relation to the numbers that come before and af ter it If embodiment could be articulated separate from the bodyan impossibility for several reasons not least because articulation system atizes and normalizes experiences in the act of naming themit would be like Funess numbers a froth of discrete utterances registering the contin uous and infinite play of difference Yet there are theories like this one that abstractly and generally insist on the importance of the particular Michel de Certeau for example provides a useful corrective to Foucault in pointing to the importance of individual articulations of cultural appropriations 12 Embodiment is akin to articula tion in that it is inherently performative subject to individual enactments and therefore always to some extent improvisational Whereas the body can disappear into information with scarcely a murmur of protest embod iment cannot for it is tied to the circumstances of the occasion and the per son As soon as embodiment is acknowledged the abstractions of the Panopticon disintegrate into the particularities of specific people embed dedin specific contexts Along with these particularities come concomitant strategies for resistances and subversions excesses and deviations It is primarily the body that is naturalized within a culture embodiment becomes naturalized only secondarily through its interactions with con cepts of the body Consequently when theorists uncover the ideolOgical underpinnings of naturalization they denaturalize the body rather than embodiment As the example of Foucault illustrates itis possible to decon struct the content of the abstraction while still leaving the mechanism of ab straction intact Moving out of the frictionless and disembodied realm of abstraction requires articulating embodiment and the body together How can this articulation be accomplished without simply absorbing embodi ment back into the body One possibility is to complicate and enrich the tension between embodi ment and the body by juxtaposing this tension with another binary distinc tioninscription and incorporationthat partly converges and partly diverges from it I envision these two bimodalities acting in complex synco pation with each other like two sine waves moving at different frequencies and with different periods of repetition How does the inscriptionincor poration coupling relate to bodyembodiment Like the body inscription is normalized and abstract in the sense that it is usually considered as a sys tem of signs operating independently of any particular manifestation In Foucaults analysis of Linnaeuss biolOgical taxonomies it does not matter whether the taxonomies were Originally printed in Gothic or Roman type their significance derives from the concepts they express not from the medium in which they appear When the concepts are transported from one medium to another for instance by being cited in Foucaults text and thus printed in a different typeface the original medium disappears from sight Moreover even the awareness that the original medium has disap peared is erased by the implicit assumption that Linnaeuss words have been exactly reproduced Such writing practices are so common that we do not normally attend to them I foreground them now to point out that they constitute inscription as a conceptual abstraction rather than as an instanti ated materiality In contrast to inscription is incorporation An incorporating practice such as a goodbye wave cannot be separated from its embodied medium for it exists as such only when it is instantiated in a particular hand making a particular kind of gesture It is pOSSible of course to abstract a sign from the embodied gesture by representing it in a different medium for The Materiality of Informatics I example by drawing on a page the outline of a stylized hand with wavy lines indicating motion In this case however the gesture is no longer an incorporating practice Rather it has been transformed precisely into an inscription that functions as if it were independent of any particular in stantiation This line of thought leads to the follOwing homology as the body is to embodiment so inscription is to incorporation Just as embodiment is in constant interplay with the body so incorporating practices are in constant interplay with inscriptions that abstract the practices into signs When the focus is on the body the particularities of embodiment tend to fade from view similarly when the focus is on inscription the particularities ofincor po ration tend to fade from view Conversely when the focus shifts to em bodiment a specific material experience emerges out of the abstraction of the body just as the particularities of an incorporating practice emerge out of the abstraction of inscription Embodiment cannot exist without a mate rial structure that always deviates in some measure from its abstract repre sentations an incorporating practice cannot exist without an embodied creature to enact it a creature who always deviates in some measure from the norms One path into further understanding the articulation between embodiment and the body then is to explore the connection between in scribing and incorporating practices Incorporating Practices and Embodied Knowledge The distinction between incorporating and inscribing practices a distinc tion implicit in Maurice MerleauPontys Phenomenology of Percep tion 13has been developed further by Paul Connerton in How Societies Remember Following Connerton I mean by an incorporating practice an action that is encoded into bodily memory by repeated performances until it becomes habitual Learning to type is an incorporating practice as both Connerton and MerleauPontyobserve When we say that someone knows how to type we do not mean that the person can cognitively map the loca tion of the keys or can understand the mechanism producing the marks Rather we mean that this person has repeatedly performed certain actions until the keys seem to be extensions of his or her fingers Someone can know how to type but not know how to read the words produced such as when a typist reproduces script in a language that the typist does not speak conversely just as someone can be able to read a typescript without know ing how to type The bodys competencies and skills are distinct from dis course although in some contexts they can produce discourse or can be 200  Chapter Eight read discursively This is Connertons point when he The Materiality of Informatics I contextual components of incorporation give it qualities that are distinc tively different from those of inscription Just as incorporating practices are not necessarily more natural than inscribing practices so embodiment is not more essentialist than the body Indeed it is difficult to see what essentialism would mean in the context of embodiment Essentialism is normative in its impulse denoting qualities or attributes shared by all human beings Though it is true that all humans share embodiment embodied experience is dispersed along a spectrum of possibilities Which possibilities are activated depends on the contexts of enactment so that no one position is more essential than any other For similar reasons embodiment does not imply an essentialist self As Fran cisco Varela Evan Thompson and Eleanor Rosch argue in The Embodied Mind a coherent continuous essential self is neither necessary nor suffi cient to explain embodied experience16 The closer one comes to the flux of embodiment Varela and his coauthors believe the more one is aware that the coherent self is a fiction invented out of panic and fear In this view em bodiment subversively undercuts essentialism rather than reinforces it If embodiment is not essentialist it is also not algOrithmic This conclu sion has important implications for debates over what difference embodi ment makes to thinking and learning In What Computers Cant Do Hubert Dreyfus argues that many human behaviors cannot be formalized in a heuristic program for a digital computer because these behaviors are embodied For Dreyfus embodiment means that humans have available to them a mode ofleaming and hence of intellection different from that de riving from cogitation alone He gives the example of a child learning to pick up a cup The child need not have an analytic understanding of the mo tor responses and dynamiCS involved in this action the child need only flail around until managing to connect Then to learn the action to be able to perform it at will the child only has to repeat what was done before At no point does the child have to break down the action into analytical compo nents or explicit instructions The advantage of this kind ofleaming is that everything does not need to be specified in advance Moreover the learning can be structured into complex relations without the necessity of a formal recognition that the re lations exist Drawing from Maurice MerleauPonty Karl Polanyi Jean Piaget and other phenomenologists Dreyfus delineates three functions that are characteristic of embodied learning and are not present in com puter programs an inner horizon that consists of a partly determined partly open context of anticipation the global character of the anticipation which relates itto other pertinent contexts in fluid shifting patterns of con zoz I Chapter Eight nection and the transferability of such anticipation from one sense modal ity to another 17 One implication of this view of embodied learning is that humans know much more than they consciously realize they know An other is that this embodied knowledge may not be completely formaliz able since the openness of the horizon allows for ambiguities and new permutations that cannot be programmed into explicit decision proce dures As we shall see in chapter 9 this provides researchers in mobile ro botics such as Rodney Brooks with an argument for the superiority of mobile embodied robots over computer programs which have no capac ity to move about and explore the environment In ways Dreyfus did not an ticipate artificiallife researchers have moved closer to his position than to the artificialintelligence research programs that he argues against A further implication of embodied interaction with the environment is developed by Pierre Bourdieu He argues that even if one is successful in reducing some area of embodied knowledge to analytical categories and explicit procedures one has in the process changed the kind of knowledge itis for the fluid contextual interconnections that define the open horizons of embodied interactions would have solidified into discrete entities and sequential instructions He makes this point that largely unnoticed and unacknowledged changes occur when embodied knowledge is expressed through analytical schemain his discussion of the seasonal rituals of the Kabyle a group of Berber tribes living in Algeria and Tunisia The calendar that the Kabyle enact through improvisational embodied practices is not the same calendar that the anthropologist extracts in schematic form from data provided by informants Whereas the anthropologists schema will show fields houses and calendars arranged according to such dualities as hot and cold male and female for the Kabyle this knowledge exists not as abstractions but as patterns of daily life learned by practicing actions until they become habitual Abstraction thus not only affects how one describes learning but also changes the account of what is learned Bourdieus work illustrates how embodied knowledge can be structur ally elaborate conceptually coherent and durably installed without ever having to be cognitively recognized as such Through observation and rep etition the child attains a practical mastery of the claSSificatory schemes which in no way implies symboliC mastery By transposing terms of sym metry relations the child is able to grasp the rationale of what Bourdieu calls the habitus a word coined to recall the habitual nature of embodied actions defined as the durably installed generative principle of regu lated improvisations18 The habitus which is learned perpetuated and The Materialitv of Informatics  changed through embodied practices should not be thought of as a collec tion of rules but as a series of dispositions and inclinations that are both subject to circumstances and durable enough to pass down through gener ations The habitus is conveyed through the orientation and movement of the body as it traverses cultural spaces and experiences temporal rhythms For the Kabyle the spatial arrangements of home village and field instan tiate the dichotomies that serve as generative principles stimulating impro visation within the regulated exchanges defined by the habitus Living in these spaces and participating in their organization form the body in char acteristic ways which in tum provides a matrix of permutations for thought and action To look at thought in this way is to tum Descartes upside down The cen tral premise is not that the cogitating mind can be certain only of its ability to be present to itself but rather that the body exists in space and time and that through its interaction with the environment it defines the parame ters within which the cogitating mind can arrive at certainties which not coincidentally almost never include the fundamental homologies generat ing the boundaries of thought What counts as knowledge is also radically revised for conscious thought becomes an epiphenomenon corresponding to the phenomenal base the body provides In Eye and Mind MerleauPonty articulates a vision similar to Bour dieus when he states that the body is not a chunk of space or a bundle of functions but an intertwining of vision and movement19 Whereas the causal thinking that Descartes admired in geometry and sought to emulate in philosophy erases context by abstracting experience into generalized patterns embodiment creates context by forging connections between in stantiated action and environmental conditions Marking a tum from foundation to flux embodiment emphaSizes the importance of context to human cognition Here in another key and a reverse direction we see re played the decontextualization that information underwent when it lost its body Just as dis embodiment required that context be erased so remem bering embodiment means that context be put back into the picture When accounts oflearning change so do accounts of cultural transmis sion In How Societies Remember Paul Connerton links embodiment with memory He points out that rituals commemorative ceremonies and other bodily practices have a performative aspect that an analysis of the content does not grasp Like performative language performative rituals must be enacted to take place A liturgy for example is an ordering of speech acts which occurs when and only when these utterances are performed if 204  Chapter Eight there is no performance there is no ritual Although liturgies are primarily verbal they are not exclusively so Gestures and movements accompany the words in addition to the sense data created by speaking and hearing Over and above or better below the verbal aspects is the incorporation enacted through sensory responses motor control and proprioception Because these ceremonies are embodied practices to perform them is al ways in some sense to accept them whatever ones conscious beliefs We may suppose the beliefs someone else holds sacred to be merely fantastic Connerton wrote but it can never be a light matter to demand that their actual expression be violated  To make patriots insult their flag or to force pagans to receive baptism is to violate them20 Bodilypractices have this power because they sediment into habitual ac tions and movements sinking below conscious awareness Atthis level they achieve an inertia that can prove surprisingly resistant to conscious inten tions to modifY or change them By their nature habits do not occupy con scious thought they are habitual precisely because they are done more or less automatically as if the knowledge of how to perform the actions resided in ones fingers or physical mobility rather than in ones mind This property of the habitual has political implications When a new regime takes over it attacks old habits vigorously for this is where the most refrac tory resistance to change will be met Bourdieu comments that all societies wanting to make a new man should approach the task through processes ofdeculturation and reculturation focused on bodily practices Hence revolutionaries place great emphasis on the seemingly most insignificant details of dress bearing physical and verbal manners because they en trust to the body in abbreviated and practical ie mnemonic form the fundamental principles of the arbitrary content of the culture21 Bourdieu somewhat overstates the case when he asserts that principles embodied in this way are placed beyond the grasp of consciousness and hence cannot be touched by voluntary deliberate transformation p 94 but he is correct in emphasizing the resistance of such practices to intellec tion He also rightly sees the importance of these practices for education and discipline The whole trick of pedagOgic reason he observes lies preCisely in the way it extorts the essential while seeming to demand the in Significant in obtaining the respect for form and forms of respect which constitute the most visible and at the same time the besthidden because most natural manifestation of submission to the established order  The concession of politeness always contains political concessions pp 9495 Along similar lines Connerton wrote Every group will en trust to bodily automatisms the values and categories which they are most The Materiality of Informatics  anxious to conserve They will know how well the past can be kept in mind by a habitual memory sedimented in the body22 To summarize four distinguishing characteristics of knowledge gained through incorporating practices have emerged from the discussion so far First incorporated knowledge retains improvisational elements that make it contextual rather than abstract that keep it tied to the circumstances of its instantiation Second it is deeply sedimented into the body and is highly resistant to change Third incorporated knowledge is partly screened from conscious view because it is habitual Fourth because it is contextual re sistant to change and obscure to the cogitating mind it has the power to de fine the boundaries within which conscious thought takes place To these four characteristics I want to add a fifth When changes in incorporating practices take place they are often linked with new technologies that affect how people use their bodies and experience space and time Formed by technology at the same time that it creates technology embodiment medi ates between technology and discourse by creating new experiential frameworks that serve as boundary markers for the creation of correspond ing discursive systems In the feedback loop between technological inno vations and discursive practices incorporation is a crucial link Having distinguished between incorporating and inscribing practices I want to explore the connections between them To complete the model I have been constructing I tum now to Mark JohnsonS The Body in the Mind 23 It is a truism in contemporary theory that discourse writes the body Johnson illustrates how the body writes discourse He shows that the bodys orientation in time and space deriving from such common experi ences as walking upright and finding a vertical stance more conducive to mobility than a horizontal position creates a repository of experiences that are encoded into language through pervasive metaphoric networks Con sider for example metaphors having to do with verticality We speak of someone being upright in a moral or ethical sense of people at the top and of upscale lifestyles Depressing events are a downer in a recession people are down on their luck and entrylevel people start at the bot tom of the ladder The hierarchical structures expressed and constituted through these metaphors Johnson argues have a basis in bodily experi ence that reinforces and reinscribes their social and linguistic implications Other common body experiences giving rise to extensive metaphoric net works include inout frontback and containeduncontained Johnson characterizes such schema as prepropositional The point of his inquiry is to show that these encoded experiences bubble up into language in propo sitional statements such as He got high and in metapropositional state 206  Chapter Eight ments having to do with the truth or goodness of propositions such as That statement expresses a higher truth An obvious implication is that if we had bodies with significantly different physiological structures for example ex oskeletons rather than endoskeletons or unilateral rather than bilateral symmetries the schema underlying pervasive metaphoric networks would also be radically altered Of the theorists discussed here Johnson launches perhaps the most se vere attack on objectivism Thus it is ironic that he reinscribes objectivist presuppositions in positing a universal body unmarked by gender ethnic ity physical disability or culture Insisting that the body is an important part of the context from which language emerges he erases the specific contexts provided by embodiment The consequences of this erasure can be seen in his discussion of a passage from Men on Rape in which a law clerk tells why rape is in his view sometimes justified Johnson shows that the clerks reasoning is based on a series of interrelated propositions that begin with the idea that physical attraction is a physical force The clerk con structs a womans physical attractiveness as an aggression that she practices on men and to which they sometimes respond with allegedly retaliatory violence In some ways Johnsons analysis is remarkably astute for it reveals how gendered experiences of embodiment get encoded into implicit proposi tions Yet with stunning reticence he never remarks on the gender politics so obviously foregrounded by this series of propositions treating the exam ple as if it were sexually and culturally neutral More than one graduate stu dent whom I have asked to read Johnsons book has thrown it down in disgust at this point assuming that any analysis so genderblind could have nothing significant to say to her Although I sympathize with the reaction it is a mistake for the general point that embodiment is encoded into lan guage through metaphoric networks is strengthened rather than undercut by insisting on the specificities of phYSically diverse and differentially marked bodies Just as I can imagine that schema would vary for different physiologies so I can envision that metaphors would vary in response to dif ferent experiences of embodiment created by histOrically positioned and culturally constructed bodies From such considerations emerges an en riched appreciation of how inscribing and incorporating practices work to getherto create the heterogeneous spaces of postmodern technolOgies and cultures Although Johnson does not develop this implication his analysis sug gests that when people begin using their bodies in Significantly different ways either because of technological innovations or other cultural shifts The Materiality of Informatics  207 changing experiences of embodiment bubble up into language affecting the metaphoric networks at play within the culture At the same time dis cursive constructions affect how bodies move through space and time in fluence what technologies are developed and help to structure the interfaces between bodies and technologies By concentrating on a period when a new technology comes into being and is diffusing throughout the culture one should be able to triangulate between incorporation inscrip tion and technological materiality to arrive at a fuller description of these feedback loops than discursive analysis alone would yield To develop such an analysis I concentrate in the follOwing section on an information tech nology appropriate to the era under discussion specifically the use of mag netic taperecording from the early 1900s to 1962 the year Burroughs published The Ticket That Exploded Chapters 9 and 10 continue the analy sis into an array of contemporary virtual technolOgies Let us now return to an earlier period when it was a startling discovery to learn that ones voice could be taken out of the body and put into a machine where it could be manipulated to say something that the speaker had never heard before Audiotape and Its Cultural Niche In his groundbreakingwork Reading Voices Literature and the Phonotext Garrett Stewart asks not howwe read or why we read but where we read24 He decides we read in the body particularly in the vocal apparatus that pro duces subvocalization during silent reading This subvocalization is essen tial he argues to the production ofliterary language Language becomes literary for Stewart when it cannot be adequately replaced by other words when that particular language is essential to achieving its effects Literary language works by surrounding its utterances with a shimmer of virtual sounds homophoniC variants that suggest alternative readings to the words actually printed on the page Subvocalization actualizes these possibilities in the body and makes them available for interpretation Several interest ing consequences flow from this argument First the bodily enactment of suppressed sound plays a central role in the reading process Second read ing is akin to the interior monologue that we all engage in exceptthat it sup plies us with another story usually a more interesting one than that provided by the stream of subvocalized sound coming out of our own con sciousness Third the production of subvocalized sound may be as impor tant to subjectivity as it is to literary language 25 We are now in a position to think about what taperecording means for certain literary texts Audiotape opens the possibility that the voice can be taken out of the body and placed into a machine If the production of sub vocalized sound is essential to reading literary texts what happens to the stories we tell ourselves if this sound is no longer situated in the bodys sub vocalizations but is in the machine Often histories of technology and liter ature treat technology as a theme or subject to be represented within the world of the text I want to take a different approach focusing on the tech nical qualities of audiotape that changed the relation of voice and body a change Burroughs associates in Ticket with the production of a new kind of subjectivity In the mutating and metamorphosing bodies of Ticket we can see a harbinger of the posthuman body that will be fully articulated in the follOwing chapters These mutations are intimately bound up with internal monologues that in Burroughss view parasitically inhabit the body But I am getting ahead of my story First we need to trace the development of the audio technology that he uses to effect this startling view of discourse as a bodily infestation Born in the early 1900s and coming of age after World War II audiotape may already be reaching old age fading from the marketplace as it is re placed by compact disks computer hypermedia and the like The period when audiotape played an important role in US and European consumer culture may well be limited to the four decades of 195090 Writing his cybernetic trilogyThe Ticket That Exploded The Soft Machine and Nova Expressin the late 1950s and 1960s William Burroughs was close enough to the beginnings of audiotape to regard it as a technology of revo lutionary power Long after writing dissociated presence from inscription voice continued to imply a subject who was present in the moment and in the flesh Audiotape was of course not the first technology to challenge this assumption and the cultural work it did can best be understood in the con text of related audio technologies particularly telephone radio and phonograph Telephone and radio broke the link between presence and voice by mak ing it possible to transport voice over distance26 Before audiotape and phonograph however telephone and radio happened in the present Speaker and listener although phYSically separated had to share the same moment in time Telephone and radio thus continued to participate in the phenomenology of presence through the simultaneity that they produced and that produced them In this sense they were more like each other than either was like the phonograph By contrast the phonograph functioned primarily as a technology of inscription reproducing sound through a rigid disk that allowed neither the interactive spontaneity of telephone nor the ephemerality of radio The Materiality of Informatics  209 The niche that audiotape filled was configured through the interlocking qualities of the audio technologies that preceded it in a process Friedrich Kittler has aptly called medial ecology discussed briefly in chapter 227 Like the phonograph audiotape was a technology of inscription but with the crucial difference that it permitted erasure and rewriting As early as 1888 Oberlin Smith at one time president of the American Society of Me chanical Engineers proposed that sound could be recorded by magnetiz ing iron particles that adhered to a carrier 28 He was too busy to implement his idea however and the ball passed to Valdemar Poulsen a young Danish engineer who accidentally discovered that patterns traced on the side of a magnetized tuning fork became visible when the fork was dipped in iron powder When the fork was demagnetized the patterns were erased He saw in the imprinting and erasure of these patterns the possibility of a recording device for sound using iron wire as the carrier Its immediate commercial use he imagined would lie in providing tangible records of telephone conversations He called the device a Telegraphone which he understood to signify writing the voice at a distance At the 1900 Paris Ex position he won the Grand Prix for his invention29 Despite extensive pub licity however he was not able to raise the necessary capital in Europe for its development By 1903 the patents had passed to the American Tele graphone Company ATC which raised a huge amount of money 5000000 by selling stock Five years later the owners of ATC had still not built a single machine Their main business in fact turned out to be raising money for the machines rather than actually producing the ma chines When they did finally tum out a few operational devices in 1911 using the famous model Phoebe Snow to advertise them as dictation ma chines the sound quality was so bad that the Dupont Company after in stalling them in a central dictation system ended up suing The questionable status of the machines was exacerbated during World War I when the Telefunken Company of America was accused of using them to encode and transmit secret messages to Germany From the beginning au diotape was marked with the imprint of international capitalism and poli tics as surely as it was with the imprint of voices By 1932 steel tape had become the carrier of choice in highend ma chines and the British Broadcasting Corporation BBC became actively interested in the development of steel tape using it to carry the Christmas address of King George V in that year Film tape created by coating paper or plastic tape with iron oxide and feeding it through a ringshaped head appeared on the scene by 193530 The great advantage of film tape was that it could be easily spliced but originally it had such poor sound quality that 210  Chapter Eight it could not compete with steel tape The problem of establishing good cor respondence between sound frequency and the pattern on film tape that is controlling hysteresis was partly solved by the introduction of high frequency bias in 193831 By 1941 the sound quality of film tape had so improved that it was competitive with steel tape in studio work On the con sumer market machines with wire were still common It was not until after World War II that systematic research was carried out to find the optimum coating material for film tape and only in 1948 was the first American patent issued for a magnetic recording machine using film tape and a ring head The use of film tape then expanded rapidly and within a decade it had rendered steel tape obsolete with film tape being used in the consumer market as well as the professional studios By the late 1950s then magnetic tape had acquired the qualities that within the existing cultural formation gave it the force of paradox It was a mode of voice inscription at once permanent and mutable repeating past moments exactly yet also permitting present interventions that radically al tered its form and meaning These interventions could moreover be done at home by anyone who had the appropriate equipment Whereas the phonograph produced objects that could be consumed only in their manu factured form magnetic tape allowed the consumer to be a producer as well The switches activating the powerful and paradoxical technoconcep tual actors of repetition and mutation presence and absence were in the hands of the masses at least the masses who could afford the equipment The paradoxical qualities that magnetic tape was perceived to have in the late 1950s were forcefully expressed by Roy Walker involved in making taperecordings for the BBC during this period Anyone who has made a BBC recording and been in on the editing session may emerge feeling that he can no longer call himself his own Cuts and transpositions can be and are made Halves of sentences spoken at different times can be amalga mated to let a speaker hear himself say the opposite of what he knows he said Hearing oneself say something and continue with something else said half an hour earlier can be peculiarly disconcerting You might have the feeling that if you went quickly out of the studio you might catch yourself coming in32 His language locates the disconcerting effect both in the time delay sentences spoken at different times can be amalgamated and in the disjunction between voice and presence he can no longer call himself his own When these qualities of audiotape were enacted within literary productions a complex interplay was set up between representational codes and the specificities of the technology When voice was displaced onto tape the body metonymicallyparticipated in the transformations that The Materiality of Informatics  voice underwent in this medium For certain texts after 1950 the body be came a taperecorder When Burroughs wrote The Ticket That Exploded he took seriously the possibilities for the metonymic equation between taperecorder and body 33 He reasoned that if the body can become a taperecorder the voice can be understood not as a naturalized union of voice and presence but as a mechanical production with the frightening ability to appropriate the bodys vocal apparatus and use it for ends alien to the self The word is now a virus TTE p 49 the narrator says in a phrase indebted to the Buddhist inspired idea that ones sense of selfhood is maintained through an internal monologue which is nothing other than the story the self tells to assure it self that it exists34 Woven into this monologue are the fictions that society wants its members to believe the monologue enacts selfdiscipline as well as selfcreation Burroughs proposes to stop the interior monologue by making it external and mechanical recording it on tape and subjecting the recording to various manipulations Communication must become total and conscious before we can stop it the narrator asserts TTE p  51 Yet splicing tape is far from innocuous Once someones vocalizations and body sounds are spliced into someone elses the effects can feed back into the bodies setting off a riot of mutations The taperecorder acts both as a metaphor for these mutations and as the instrumentality that brings them about The taped body can separate at the vertical divide line grotesquely becoming half one person and half another as if it were tape splicedlengthvise In a disturbingly literal sense the taperecorder be comes a twoedged sword cutting through bodies as well as through the programs that control and discipline them In The Ticket That Exploded the body is a site for contestation and resistance on many levels as metaphor as physical reality as linguistic con struct and last but hardly least as taperecorder The taperecorder is cen tral to understanding Burroughss vision of how the politics of cooptation work Entwined into human flesh are prerecordings that function as parasites ready to take over the organism These prerecordings may be thought of as social conditioning for example an American upper middle class upbringing with maximum sexual frustration and humiliations imposed by MiddleWestern matriarchs TTE p 139 which not coinci dentally matches BurroughsS own experience A strong sense of sexual nausea pervades the text and sexuality is another manifestation of prere cording Parodically rewriting the fable in Platos Symposium about the spherical beings who were cut in half to make humans the narrator asserts All human sex is this unsanitary arrangement whereby two entities at  Chapter Eight tempt to occupy the same threedimensional coordinate points giving rise to the sordid latrine brawls  It will be readily understandable that a pro gram of systematic frustration was necessary in order to sell this crock of sewage as Immortality and Garden of Delights and love TTE p 52 The idea of two entities trying to occupy the same space is further rein forced by the vertical divide line crossing the body the phYSically marked line in bone muscle and skin where the neural canal of the monthold fe tus closes to create the beginnings of the torso35 The early point at which the divide line is imprinted on human flesh suggests how deeply impli cated into the organism are the prerecordings that socialize it into commu nity norms In one scene the narrator sees his body on the operating table split down the middle while a doctor with forceps was extracting crab parasites from his brain and spineand squeezing green fish paraSites from the separated flesh My God what a mess the doctor exclaims The difficulty is with two halvesother parasites will invade sooner or later  Sew him up nurse TTE p 85 As the doctorintimates the body is always already fallen Divided within itself rather than an organic unity it is subject to occupation and expropriation by a variety of parasitic forms both cultural and physical Chief among these parasitic forms is the word It is a truism in con temporary theory that discursive formations can have material effects in the physical world Without having read Foucault and Derrida Burroughs came to similar conclusions a decade earlier imagining the word as the bodys Other Half The narrator stated Word is an organism The pres ence of the Other Half a separate organism attached to your nervous sys tem on an air line of words can now be demonstrated experimentally The experiments to which the narrator alludes were performed by among oth ers John Cunningham Lilly who in the late 1950s and 1960s used isolation tanks to test the malleability of human perception36 The experiments re quired subjects to enter a dark tank and to float cut off from all sensory in put in water kept at body temperature The narrator mentions that a common hallucination of subjects in sense withdrawal was the feeling of another body sprawled through the subjects body at an angle TTE p 49 Yes quite an angle the narrator ironically remarks identifYing the sen sation as the subjects perception of his other half the word virus that invades the organism until it seems as intrinsic to the body as flesh and bone For the narrator the proof of this parasitic invasion and infection is the interior monologue we all experience Modem man has lost the option of silence he asserts Try to achieve even ten seconds of inner silence You The Materiality of Informatics  will encounter a resisting organism thatforces you to talk That organism is the word TTE pp 4950 Burroughss project is to offer the reader as many ways as he can imagine to stop the monologue to rewrite or erase the prerecordings and to extricate the subject from the parasitic invasion of the Other Half Taperecorders are central to this project its all done with tape recorders the narrator comments TTE p162 One strategy is to externalize dialogue by getting it out of your head and into the ma chines TTE p 163 He suggests thatthe reader record the last argument the reader had with a boyfriend or girlfriend putting the readers side of the argument on one recorder and the friends side on the other Then the two recorders can argue with each other leaving the human participants free to stop replaying the conversation in their heads and get on with their lives The narrator also suggests recording random sounds on a third machine snippets from a news broadcast sayand mixing them in too The intru sion of the random element is significant it aims to break the reader not only out of personal obsessions but also out of the surrounding culturally constructed envelope of sounds and words Wittgenstein said No propo sition can contain itself as an argument the narrator remarks interpret ing this as follows The only thing not prerecorded in a prerecorded universe is the prerecording itself which is to say any recording that con tains a random factor TTE p166 The intrusion of randomness is important in another way as well for Burroughs is acutely aware of the danger that he might through his words spread the viral infection he is trying to combat It is important therefore that disruptive techniques be instantiated within the texts own language These techniques range from his famous use of the cutup where he phYSically cuts up previously written narratives and arbitrarily splices them together to more subtle methods such as shifting between different lin guistic registers without transition or explanation37 Perhaps the single most important device is the insistent pressure to take metaphors literallyor put another way to erase the distinction between words and things Language is not merely like a virus it is a virus replicating through the host to become visible as green fish in the flesh and crab parasites tear ing at the base of the spine and brain In Burroughs the material effects of language do not need to be mediated through physical diSCipline to reform the body for example through the prescribed postures and gestures used to teach penmanship in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries With a writers license he makes language erupt directly into the body The body itself moreover is treated as if it phYSically were a recorder regulated by the principles that govern magnetic tape in its reproduction erasure and reconfiguration Here within the represented world of the text tech niques of inscription merge with incorporated practices in a cyborg config uration of explosive potential The double edge of this potential is not difficult to understand for the reifYing and infective power of words can be defused only through other words which can always tum against their mas ter and become infectious in tum Making the word flesh is both how the virus infects and how the vaccine disinfects In either case the flesh will not continue unchanged The pressure toward literalization can be seen in the narrative sections that use the conventions of science fiction to figure the invasion of the word as a physical operation early on the narrator announces I am reading a science fiction book called The Ticket That Exploded TTE p 5 On this track Earth has been invaded by the alien Nova mob socalled because their strategy is to drive the planet to extreme chaos or nova The mob in cludes such creatures as heavymetal addicts from Uranus sex addicts from Venus and other parasitic organisms that can occupy human flesh Nova criminals are not threedimensional organismsthough they are quite definite organisms as we shall seebut they need threedimen sional human agents to operate TTE p 57 A single parasitic alien can take over hundreds of humans stringing together its hosts to form rows of coordinate points analogous to lines of print or to phonemes subordi nated through grammar and syntax The reputed leader of the mob is an ap propriately bimorphic creature called variously Mr Bradly Mr Martin Mr and Mrs D or simply the Ugly spirit In this instantiation of the Other Half the word itself is split down the middle A counterinvasion has been staged by the Nova police whose weapons include radio static camera guns that destabilize images by vibrating them at supersonic speeds and of course taperecorders Recruiting Mr Lee this pseudonym used often by Burroughs was his mothers maiden name the district supervisor tells Mr Lee that he will receive his instruc tions from books street signs films in some cases from agents who pur port to be and may actually be members of the organization There is no certainty Those who need certainty are of no interest to this department This is in point of fact a nonorganization the aim of which is to immunize our agents against fear despair and death We intend to break the birth death cycle TTE p 10 One of the criminals the department seeks is Johnny Yen whose name suggests sexual desire Death is orgasm is rebirth is death in orgasm is their unsanitary Venusian gimmick is the whole birth death cycle of action the narrator explains He proceeds apparentlyexas perated to make his point even more obvious You got itNow do you The Materiality of Informatics I understand who Johnny Yen isThe BoyGirl Other Half strip tease God of sexual frustrationErrand boy from the death trauma TTE p 53 On this track the action can be read as a physical contest between the Nova mob and the Nova police as when a police operative from Minraud blows a mob crab guard into smithereens But if the word is a parasite with material effects the distinction between metaphor and actuality represen tation and reality is moot Thus another strategy of resistance is the Rewrite Room the space from which comes the expose of Johnny Yen cited above Johnny Yen is not blown away but rather is rewritten to become a rather enchanting green fish boy an amphibious lifeform a benign bi morphic creature living in the canals and mating with Ali the street boy in a nonhuman life cycle that destabilizes the human sense of what constitutes the body life and death The crisis of mutation the recognition that pat tern is always already penetrated by randomness is here associated with a form of embodiment that moves through a froth of noise as easily as a fish through water For human subjects however this destabilization is bound to be threat ening rather than simply liberating for the narrative attempts to put into play all the boundaries that define human subjectivity Body boundaries are often literally diSintegrated for example by the Sex Skin an organism that surrounds its victims with a second skin that gives its victims intense sexual pleasure while dissolving and ingesting them Positioned against the clear threat of this kind of sexual delirium are taperecorders potentially liberat ing but also not without danger Recording ones body sounds and splicing them into someone elses can free one from the illusion that body sounds cannot exist apart from the interior monologue But just as Burroughss words can become parasitic if not selfdisrupted so these sounds have the potential to constitute a parasitic monologue in tum According to the nar rator the splicing produces a strong erotic reaction If it is expressed in ac tual sexual contact it acts as an aphrodisiac  nothing more  Butwhen a susceptible subject is spliced in with someone who is not there then it acts as a destructive virus ironically becoming the phenomenon it was meant to counteract TTE p 20 As well as disrupting words audibly present Burroughs wants to create or exposenew ones from the substrata of the medium itself He de scribes experiments based on inching tape manually rubbing the tape back and forth across the head at varying speeds Such exercises bring you a liberation from old association locks  you will hear words that were not in the original recording new words made by the machine different people will scan out different words of course but some of the words are quite clearly there The technique gives new meaning to Marshall McLuhans aphorism The medium is the message for it is as if the words themselves had been interrogated and forced to reveal their hidden meanings it is in teresting to record these words literally made by the machine itself TTE p 206 Here Burroughs envisions incorporating practices that can pro duce inscriptions without the mediation of consciousness He actually performed the taperecorder experiments he describes from the late 1950s through the late 1970s He inched tape to create as he heard it new words he recorded radio broadcasts and spliced the tape to achieve an aural cutup and he held the microphone to the base of his throat and tried to record his own subvocal speech As if anticipating Chris tian fundamentalists who hear Satanic messages hidden in records and tapes people whose sensibilities he would no doubt enjoy outraging he also read from his books including The Nova Express and The Ticket That Exploded and spliced the readings in with music played backward The recordings have been preserved and some of this archival material has been collected in a phonograph album entitled Nothing Here Now but the Recordings38 Late one night I traveled to the music library at the U ni versity of California at San Diego to listen to the album Even though the experience of sitting in the nearly deserted hightech facility insulated from exterior sound was eerily conducive to hearing the words that Burroughs claims are there some of the passages are clearly of historic in terest only In particular the section that records subvocal speech is virtu ally unintelligible as patterned sound Perhaps paradOxically I found the recording less forceful as a demonstration of Burroughss theories than his writing For me the aurality of his prose elicits a greater response than the machine productions it describes and instantiates The power of that writing is evident in the writing machine section of The Ticket That Exploded The narrator describes an Exhibition which includes a room with metal walls magnetic mobiles under flickering blue light and smell of ozone TTE p 62 The room is situated of course in side a taperecorder Normally narrative fiction leaps over the technolo gies printing press paper ink that produce it and represents the external world as if this act of representation did not require a material basis for its production Burroughs turns this convention inside out locating the ex ternal world inside the technolOgical artifact The move constructs a com pletely different relation between fiction and the material means of its production constituting the technology as the ground out of which the nar rative action evolves This technique hints that the technology is not merely a medium to represent thoughts that already exist but is itself capable of dy The Materiality of Informatics  namic interactions producing the thoughts it describes At issue then is the technology not only as a theme but as an articulation capable of pro ducing new kinds of subjectivities The taperecording qualities important in the Exhibition are the twin and somewhat contradictory powers of inscription and mutation Unlike marks on paper this writing can eaSily be erased and rewritten in other forms As spectators clink through turnstiles of the Exhibition great sheets of magnetized print held color and disintegrated in cold mineral si lence as word dust falls from demagnetized patterns TTE p 62 The de scription points to the attraction the recorder has for Burroughs Sound unlike print dies away unless it is constantly renewed Its ephemerality calls forth a double response that finds material expression in the technol ogy On the one hand magnetic tape allows sound to be preserved over time in this respect it counters the ephemerality of sound by transforming it into inscription On the other hand inscriptions can be easily erased and reconfigured in this sense it reproduces the impermanence of sound Burroughs was drawn to both aspects of the technology The inscription of sound in a durable medium suited his belief that the word is material whereas the malleability of sound meant that interventions were possible interventions that could radically change or eradicate the record At the Exhibition language is inscribed through word dust that falls from the walls as pervasively as smog particlles from the Los Angeles sky Anticipating videotape Burroughs imagines that picture dust also falls from the walls Photomontage fragments backed with iron stuck to pat terns and fell in swirls mixing with color dust to form new patterns shim mering falling magnetized demagnetized to the flicker of blue cylinders pulsing neon tubes and globes TTE pp 6263 When the Nova police counterinvade the planet falling

photographShift body halves TTE p 105 The Grey Room evidently refers to the mobs com munication and control center perhaps the board room where the nar rator tells us multinationals plot to take over outer and inner space In opposition to the linear centralized control of the Grey Room is the chaotic recursivity of the Exhibition Here there is no clear line between those who act and those who are acted upon The traffic flow through the 218  Chapter Eight room is structured like a recursive loop As the spectators pass they are recorded by a battery of taperecorders recording and playing back mov ing on conveyor belts and tracks and cable cars spilling the talk and metal music fountains and speech as the recorders moved from one exhibit to an other The narrator remarks parenthetically Since the recorders and movies of the exhibition are in constant operation it will be readily seen that any spectator appears on the screen sooner or later if not today then yester day or tomorrow TTE p 64 Thus spectators move along within the room hearing and watching recordings of themselves as the recordings are played back from machines that are also moving along a conveyor belt Their reactions as they hear and watch are also recorded in turn by other machines creating an infinite regress in which body and tape recording and voice image and Sight endlessly reproduce each other Within this world it makes a weird kind of sense for bodies to mutate as easily as spliced tape for the distinction between reality and representation has been largely deconstructed Characters walk in and out of screen flickering dif ferent films on and off TTE p 64 bodies split in halflengthwise screens show two films simultaneously half of one on one side half of the other on the other side a writing machine shifts one half one text and half the other through a page frame on conveyor belts TTE p 65 Inscriptions bodies sounds and images all follow the same dynamics and the same logic of splices running lengthwise to create mutated posthuman forms that both express and strive to escape from the conditioning that makes them into split beings In a wonderfully oxymoronic phrase Burroughs calls the place where culture produces its replicating sound and image tracks the reality studio Clearly no portentous exciting events are about to transpire the narrator says implicitly mocking the melodrama of his own spacealien track You will readily understand why people will go to any lengths to getin the film to cover themselves with any old film scrap  anything to avoid the hopeless deadend horror of being just who and where you all are dying animals on a doomed planet Connecting capitalist finanCing with cultural produc tions as if remembering the American Telegraphone Company he con tinues The film stock issued now isnt worth the celluloid its sic printed on There is nothing to back it up The film bank is empty To conceal the bankruptcy of the reality studio it is essential that no one should be in posi tion to set up another reality set  Work for the reality studio or else Or else you will find out how it feels to be outside the film TTE p 151 As the text draws to a close the narrator directs the readers attention to the possibility that the reality studio may indeed be closing down and that The Materiality of Informatics  the reader will therefore shortly be outside the film off the recording A similar message is given in a different medium when at the end of the penultimate section the print of the text is dislUpted by several lines of cur sive script English alternating with Arabic Each line lUns through a per mutation of To say good by silence with the lines gradually becoming more random and indecipherable as they proceed down the page TTE p 203 Perhaps Burroughs is trying to prepare the reader for the panic that sets in when the interior monologue is dislUpted and for the first time in ones life one hears silence instead of language For whatever reason he takes extraordinary care to achieve a feeling of closure unusual in his works from this period Compared with Naked Lunch the ending here is formally elaborate and thematically conclusive Echoing The Tempest the text as it winds down splices in dialogue from Shakespeares play with visions of contemporary technologies i foretold you were all spirits watching TV programTerminal electric voices end These our actors cut inA few seconds later you are melted into airRub out promised by our everliving poetMr Bradly Mr Martin five times our summonsno shelter in setting forth TTE p 174 The splices invite the reader to tease out resonances between the two works Whereas insect imagery predominates in Naked Lunch in Ticket the usual form of nonhu man life is aquatic or amphibian recalling Calibans characterization as a fishy monster Prospero conjures spirits from the air and yet his magic has a terrible materiality he can we are told raise bodies from the dead Most of all he is a supreme technician blending illusion with reality so skill fully that his art can effect changes in the real world Burroughs aims for nothing less using language to dislUpt the viral power of the word creating recordings to stop the playbacks that imprison our future in the sounds of our past If the taperecorder is as Paul Bowles called it Gods little toy The Ticket That Exploded is the tape that reveals this godmachines life transforming possibilities Bowles quoted in TTE p166 What we see is dictated by what we hear the narrator of Ticket asserts TTE p 168 There is considerable anecdotal evidence to support his claim Whereas Sight is always focused sharp and delineated sound en velopes the body as if it were an atmosphere to be experienced rather than an object to be dissected Perhaps that is why researchers in virtual reality have found that sound is much more effective than sight in imparting emo tional tonalities to their simulated worlds 39 Their experiences suggest that voice is associated with presence not only because it comes from within the body but also because it conveys new information about the subject information that goes deeper than analytical thought or conscious inten tion Manipulating sound through taperecorders thus becomes a way of producing a new kind of subjectivity that strikes at the deepest levels of awareness If we were to trace the trajectory suggested here to the end of the period when audiotape held sway it would lead to texts such as C J Cherryhs Cyteen trilogy where the body has become a corporate product molded by taking tape that is listening to conditioning tapes that lay the foundation for the subjects psychset Burroughs anticipates Cherryhs implication that the voice issuing from the taperecorder sounds finally not so much postmodern as it does posthuman Where hope exists in Ticket it appears as posthuman mutations like the fish boy whose fluidity perhaps figures a type of subjectivity attuned to the froth of noise rather than the stability of a false self living an embodied life beyond human consciousness as we know it Butthis is mere conjecture for any representation of the internal life of the fish boy could be done only in words which would infect and destroy exactly the transformation they were attempting to describe For Burroughs the emphasis remains on sub version and disruption rather than creative rearticulation Even subversion risks being coopted and taken over by the viral word it can succeed only by continuing to disrupt everything including its own prior writing In this chapter I have been concerned with Burroughss fictions not only as harbingers of the posthuman but more immediately as sites where bodyembodiment and inscriptionlincorporation are in constant and dynamiC interplay with one another As we have seen in the Exhibition inscriptions fall from the walls to become corporeal word dust incorpo rations are transformed into inscriptions through video and audiorecord ing devices bodies understood as normative and essentialized entities are rewritten to become particularized experiences of embodiment and em bodied experience is transformed through the inscriptions of the tape recording back into essentialized manifestations of the word The recursivities that entangle inscription with incorporation the body with embodiment invite us to see these polarities not as static concepts but as mutating surfaces that transform into one another much like the Mobius strip that Grosz imagines for her volatile bodies Starting from a model emphasizing polarities then we have moved toward a vision ofinteractions both pleasurable and dangerous creatively dynamiC and explOSively trans formative It is no accident that recursive loops and reflexive strategies figure im portantly in these transformations for Burroughs shared with Humberto Maturana and Philip K Dick an appreciation for how potently reflexivity can destabilize objectivist assumptions Whereas Maturana located reflex The Materiality of Informatics  ivity in biolOgical processes and Dick placed it in psycholOgical dynamics Burroughs located it in a cybernetic fusion of language and technology Mutating into and out of the taperecorder the viral word reconfigures the taperecorder as a cybernetic technology capable of radically transforming bodies and subjectivities As for the external world where clear divisions separate observer from system human from technological artifact Matu rana Dick and Burroughs agreed although for different reasons that there is no there there Whatever the limitations of their works they shared a realization that the observer cannot stand apart from the systems being observed In exploring how to integrate observer and world into a unified field of interaction they also realized that liberal humanism could not con tinue to hold sway Just as the tide of posthumanism that Norbert Wiener had struggled to contain could not be held back neither could the techno lOgical advances in informatics advances that would soon displace second wave issues with thirdwave concerns  Choprer  NIn  e NARRATIVES OF ARTIFICIAL LIFE In contrast to the circular processes of Humberto Maturanas autopoiesis the figure most apt to describe the third wave is a spiral Whereas the sec ond wave is characterized by an attempt to include the observer in an ac count of the systems functioning in the third wave the emphasis falls on getting the system to evolve in new directions Selforganization is no longer enough The third wave wants to impart an upward tension to the re cursive loops of selforganizing processes so that like a spring compressed and suddenly released the processes break out of the pattern of circular selforganization and leap outward into the new Just as Heinz von Foerster served as a transition figure between the first and second waves so Francisco Varela bridges the transition between the second and third waves We saw in chapter 6 that Maturana and Varela ex tended the definition of the living to include artificial systems After coau thoring The Embodied Mind 1 Varela began to work in a new field known as Artificial Life and coedited the papers from the first European conference in that field In the introduction to the conference volume Toward a Prac tice of Autonomous Systems he and his coauthor Paul Bourgine layout their view of what the field of Artificial Life should be They locate its ori gins in cybernetics referencing William Grey Walters electronic tortoise and Ross AshbyS homeostat Although some characteristics of autopoiesis are reinscribed on the successor field of Artificial Life especially the idea that systems are operationally closed other features are new The change is signaled in Varelas subtle reconception of autonomy He and his coauthor wrote Autonomy in this context refers to the livings basic and funda mental capacity to be to assert their existence and bring forth a world that is Significant and pertinent without being predigested in advance Thus the autonomy of the living is understood here both in regards to its actions Narratives of Artificial Life  and to the way it shapes a world into significance This conceptual explo ration goes hand in hand with the design and construction of autonomous agents and suggests an enormous range of applications at all scales from cells to societies2 For Maturana shaping a world into significance meant that perception was linked primarily to internal processes rather than external stimuli3 We have seen the difficulties he had with evolution because he sought to put the emphasis instead on the organisms holistic nature and autopoietic circularity When Varela and his coauthor speak of shaping a world into significance the important point for them is that the systems organization far from remaining unchanged can transform it self through emergent behavior The change is not so much an absolute break however as a shift in emphasis and a corresponding transformation in the kind of questions the research programs pose as well as new strate gies for answering them Thus the relation of the third wave to the second is again one of seriation an overlapping pattern of replication and innovation The shift in questions and methodologies is not of course neutral For researchers who come to the field from backgrounds in cognitive science and computer science rather than from autopoiesis as Varela does the underlying assumptions all too eaSily lend themselves to reinscribing a dis embodied view of information But as Varelas presence in the field indi cates not everyone who works in the field agrees that disembodied organisms are the best way to construct Artificial Life Just as there were competing camps in the Macy Conferencesone arguing for a disembod ied view of information and one for acontextualized embodied viewso in Artificial Life some researchers concentrate on simulations insisting that embodiment is not necessary whereas others argue that only embodied forms can fully capture the richness of an organisms interactions with the environment Our old friend the observer who was at the center of the epistemological revolution sparked by Maturana in the third wave retreats to the periphery with a consequent loss of the sophistication that Maturana brought to epistemological questions The observer has however not alto gether vanished from the scene remaining in the picture as narrator and narratee of stories about Artificial Life To see how the observers presence helps to construct the field let us tum now to consider the strange flora and fauna of the world of Artificial Life The Nature and Artifice of Artificial Life At the Fourth Conference on Artificial Life in the summer of 1994 evolu tionary biolOgist Thomas S Ray put forth two proposals4 The first was a plan to preserve biodiversity in Costa Rican rain forests the second was a suggestion that Tierra his software program creating Artificial Lifeforms inside a computer be released on the Internet so that it could breed di verse species on computers allover the world Ray saw the two proposals as complementary The first aimed to extend biological diversity for protein based lifeforms the second sought the same for siliconbased lifeforms Their juxtaposition dramatically illustrates the reconstruction of nature go ing on in the field of Artificial Life affectionately known by its practitioners as AL The object of an AL instantiation Ray wrote recently is to intro duce the natural form and process of life into an artificial medium5 The lines startle In Rays rhetoric the computer codes composing these crea tures become natural forms of life only the medium is artificial How is it possible in the late twentieth century to believe or at least claim to believe that computer codes are aliveand not only alive but nat ural The question is difficult to answer directly for it involves assumptions that are not explicitly articulated Moreover these presuppositions do not stand by themselves but move in dynamic interplay with other formula tions and ideas circulating throughout the culture In view of this complex ity the subject is perhaps best approached through indirection by looking not only at the scientific content of the programs but also at the stories told about and through them These stories I will argue constitute a multilay ered system of metaphOriC and material relays through which life na ture and the human are being redefined The first level of narrative with which I will be concerned is the Tierra program and various representations of it written by Ray and others In these representations authorial intention anthropomorphic interpreta tion and the operations of the program are so interwoven that it is impos sible to separate them As a result the program operates as much within the imagination as it does within the computer The second level of narrative focuses on the arguments and rhetorical strategies that AL practitioners use as they seek to position Artificial Life as a valid area of research within theoretical biology This involves telling a story about the state of the field and the contributions that AL can make As we shall see the secondlevel story quickly moves beyond purely profeSSional considerations evoking a larger narrative about the kinds oflife that have emerged and are emerg ing on Earth The narrative about the present and future of terrestrial evo lution forms the third level It is constituted through speculations on the relation of human beings to their silicon cousins the creatures who live inside the computer Here at the third level the implication of the ob server in the construction of all three narratives becomes explicit To in Narratives of Arrificial Life I terrogate how this complex narrative field is initiated developed and in terpolated with other cultural narratives let us begin at the first level with an explanation of the Tierra program Conventionally Artificial Life is divided into three research fronts Wetware is the attempt to create artificial biolOgical life through such tech niques as building components of unicellular organisms in test tubes Hardware is the construction of robots and other embodied lifeforms Software is the creation of computer programs instantiating emergent or evolutionary processes Although each of these areas has its distinctive em phases and research agendas they all share the sense of building life from the bottom up In the software branch with which I am concerned here the idea is to begin with a few simple local rules and then through struc tures that are highly recursive allow complexity to emerge spontaneously Emergence implies that properties or programs appear on their own often developing in ways not anticipated by the person who created the simula tion Structures that lead to emergence typically involve complex feedback loops in which the outputs of a system are repeatedly fed back in as input As the recursive looping continues small deviations can quickly become magnified leading to the complex interactions and unpredictable evolu tions associated with emergence 6 Even granting emergence it is still a long jump from programs that repli cate inside a computer to living organisms This gap is bridged largely through narratives that map the programs into evolutionary scenarios tra ditionally associated with the behavior ofliving creatures The narratives translate the operations of computer codes into biolOgical analogues that make sense of the program logiC In the process the narratives alter the bi nary operations that on a physical level amount to changing electronic po larities transforming the binary operations into the high drama of a Darwinian struggle for survival and reproduction To see this transforma tion in action consider the follOwing account of the Tierra program This account is compiled from Thomas Rays published articles and unpub lished working papers from conversations I had with him about his pro gram and from public lectures he has given on the topic7 When I visited Ray at the Santa Fe Institute he talked about the genesis of Tierra Frustrated with the slow pace of natural evolution he wondered if it would be possible to speed things up by creating evolvable artificial or ganisms within the computer One of the first challenges he faced was de signing programs robust enough to withstand mutation without crashing To induce robustness he conceived of bUilding inside the regular com puter a virtual computer made out of software Whereas the regular com 226  Chapter Nine puter uses memory addresses to find data and execute instructions the vir tual computer uses a technique Ray calls address by template Taking its cue from the topological matching of DNA bases in which one base finds its appropriate partner by diffusing through the medium until it locates an other base with a surface it can fit into like a key into a lock address by tem plate matches one code segment to another by looking for its binary inverse For example if an instruction is written in binary code 1001 the virtual computer searches nearby memory to find a matching segment with the code 0110 The strategy has the advantage of creating a container that holds the organisms and renders them incapable of replicating outside the virtual computer for the address by template operation can occur only within a virtual computer Presented with a string such as 0110 the regular computer would read it as data rather than instructions to replicate Species diversifY and evolve through mutation To introduce mutation Ray created the equivalent of cosmic rays by having the program flip the polarity of a bit once in every 10000 executed instructions In addition replication errors occur about once in every 1000 to 2500 instructions copied introducing another source of mutation Other differences spring from an effect Ray calls sloppy reproduction analogous to the genetic mixing that occurs when a bacterium absorbs fragments of a dead organism nearby To control the number of organisms Ray introduced a program that he calls the reaper The reaper monitors the population and elimi nates the oldest creatures and those who are defective that is those who have most frequently erred in executing their programs If a creature finds a way to replicate more efficiently it is rewarded by being moved down in the reapers queue and so becomes younger The virtual computer starts the evolutionary process by allocating a block of memory that Ray calls the soup an analogy with the primeval soup at the beginning oflife on Earth Unleashed inside the soup are self replicating programs normally starting with a Single 80byte creature called the ancestor The ancestor comprises three segments The first segment counts the instructions to see how long the ancestor is this proce dure ensures that the length can change without throwing off the repro ductive process the second segment reserves that much space in nearby memory putting a protective membrane around the space an analogy with the membranes that enclose living organisms and the third segment copies the ancestors code into the reserved space thus completing the re production and creating a daughter cell from the mother cell To see how mutation leads to new species consider that a bit flip occurs in the last line of the first segment changing 1100 to 1110 Normally the program Narratives of Artificial Life  would find the second segment by searching for its first line encoded 0011 N ow however the program searches until it finds a segment starting with 0001 Thus it goes not to its own second segment but to another string of code in nearby memory Many mutations are not viable and do not lead to reproduction Occasionally however the program finds a segment that starts with 0001 and that will allow it to reproduce Then a new species is created as this organism begins producing ofpring When Ray set his program running overnight he thought he would be lucky to get a 1 or 2byte variation from the 80byte ancestor Checking it the next morning he found that an entire ecology had evolved including one 22byte organism Among the mutants were parasites that had lost their own copying instructions but had developed the ability to invade a host and hijack its copying procedure One 45byte parasite had evolved into a benign relationship with the ancestor others were destructive crowding out the ancestor with their own offspring Later runs of the pro gram saw the development of hyperparasites which had evolved ways to compete for time as well as memory Computer time is doled out equally to each organism by a slicer that determines when the organism can execute its program Hyperparasites wait for parasites to invade them Then when the parasite attempts to reproduce using the hyperparasites copy proce dure the hyperparasite directs the program to its own third segment in stead of returning the program to the parasites ending segment Thus the hyperparasites code is copied on the parasites time In this way the hyper parasite greatly multiplies the time it has for reproduction for in effect it appropriates the parasites time for its own This then is the first level narrative about the program It appears with minor variations in Rays articles and lectures I t is also told in the Santa Fe Institute videotape Simple Rules  Complex Behavior in which Ray collaborated with a graphiC artist to create a visual representation of Tierra accompanied by his voiceover8 If we ask how this narrative is con stituted we can see that statements about the operation of the program and interpretations of its meaning are in continuous interplay with each other Consider the analogies implicit in such terms as mother cell daughter cell ancestor parasite and hyperparasite The terms do more than set up parallels with living systems they also reveal Rays intention in creat ing an appropriate environment in which the dynamiC emergence of evolu tionary processes could take off In this respect Rays rhetoric is quite different from that of Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene a work also deeply informed by anthropomorphic constructions Dawkinss rhetoric attributes to genes human agency and intention creating a narrative ofhu manlike struggle for lineage In his construction Dawkins overlays onto the genes the strategies emotions and outcomes that properly belong to the human domain Ray by contrast is working with artificial systems de signed by humans precisely so the creatures would be able to manifest these qualities This is the primary reason why explanation and interpreta tion are inextricably entwined in the first level narrative  Rays biomorphic namings and interpretations function not so much as an overlay as an expli cation of an intention that was there at the beginning Analogy is not inci dental or belated but is central to the programs artifactual design Important as analogy is it is not the whole story The narratives com pelling effect comes not only from analogical naming but also from images In rhetorical analysis of course image can mean either an actual picture or a verbal formulation capable of evoking a mental picture Whether an image is a visualization or visually evocative language it is a powerful mode of communication because it draws on the high density of information that images convey Visualization and visually evocative language collaborate in the videotape that the Santa Fe Institute made to publicize its work As the narrative about Tierra begins the camera flies over a scene representing the inside of a computer This stylized landscape is dominated by a block like structure representing the CPU Central Processing Unit and dotted with smaller upright rectangles representing other integrated circuits Then the camera zooms into the CPU where we see a grid upon which the creatures appear and begin to reproduce They are imaged as solid poly gons strung together to form three sections representing the three seg ments of code Let us linger at this scene and consider how it has been constructed The pastoral landscape upon which the creatures are visual ized instantiates a transformation characteristic of the new information technologies and the narratives that surround them A material object the computer has been translated into the functions it performs the programs it executes which in tum have been represented in visual codes familiar to the viewer the bodies of the creatures The path can be represented schematically as material base 7 functionality 7 representational code This kind of transformation is extremely widespread appearing in popular venues as well as in scientific applications It is used by William Gibson in Neuromancer for example when he represents the data arrays of a global informational network as solid polygons in a threedimensional space that his protagonist transformed into a point of view or pov can navigate as though flying through the atmosphere lO The schematic operates in re markably similar fashion in the video where we become a disembodied pov flying over the lifeworld of the creatures a world comfortingly famil Narrarives of Arrificial Life  iar in its threedimensional spaces and rules of operation Whereas the CPU landscape corresponds to the computers interior architecture how ever the lifeworld of the creatures does not The seamless transition be tween the two elides the difference between the material space that is inside the computer and the imagined space that in actuality consists of computer addresses and electronic polarities on the computer disk To explore how these images work to encode assumptions consider the bodies of the creatures which resemble stylized ants In the program the creatures have bodies only in a metaphoriC sense as Ray recognizes when he talks abouttheir bodies ofinformation itself an analogyD These bod ies of information are not as the expression might be taken to imply phe notypic expressions of informational codes Rather the creatures are their codes For them genotype and phenotype amount to the same thing the organism is the code and the code is the organism By representing them as phenotypes visually by giving them threedimensional bodies and verbally by calling them ancestors parasites and such Ray elides the difference between behavior properly restricted to an organism and exe cution of a code applicable to the informational domain In the process our assumptions about behavior in particular our thinking of it as indepen dent action undertaken by purposive agents are transported into the narrative Further encoding takes place in the plot Narrative tells a story and in trinsic to story is chronology intention and causality In Tierra the narra tive is constituted through the emerging story of the struggle of the creatures for survival and reproduction More than an analogy or an im age this is a drama that if presented in a different medium one would not hesitate to identify as an epic Like an epic it portrays life on a grand scale depicting the rise and fall of races some doomed and some triumphant and recording the strategies they invent as they play for the high stakes of establishing a lineage The epic nature of the narrative is even more explicit in Rays plans to develop a global ecology for Ti erra In his proposal to cre ate a digital biodiversity reserve the idea is to release the Tierra program on the Internet so that it can run in background on computers across the globe Each site will develop its own micro ecology Because background programs run when demands on the computer are at a minimum the pro grams will normally be executed late at night when most users are in bed Humans are active while the creatures are dormant the creatures evolve while we sleep Ray points out that someone monitoring activity in Tierra programs would therefore see it as a moving wave that follows dark fall around the world Linking the evolution of the creatures to the hu 230  Chapter Nine man world in a complementary diurnal rhythm the proposal edges toward a larger narrative level that interpolates their story into ours ours into theirs A similar interpolation occurs in the video The narrative appears to be following the script of Genesis from the lightning that flickering over the landscape represents the life force to the creatures who like their hu man counterparts follow the biblical imperative to be fruitful and multiply When a deathshead appears on the scene representing the reaper pro gram we understand that this pastoral existence will not last for long The idyll is punctured by competition between species strategies of subversion and cooptation and exploitation of one group by anotherin short all the trappings of rampant capitalism To measure how much this narrative ac complishes we should remem ber that what one actually sees as the output of the Tierra program is a spectrum of bar graphs tracking the numbers of programs of given byte lengths as a function of time The strategies emerge when human interpreters scrutinize the binary codes that constitute the creatures to find out how they have changed and determine how they work No one knows this better of course than Ray and other researchers in the field The video as they would no doubt want to remind us is merely an artists visualization and has no scientific standing It is moreover intended for a wide audience not all of whom are presumed to be scientists This fact in itself is interesting for the tape as a whole is an unabashed promotion of the Santa Fe Institute It speaks to the efforts that practitioners in the field are making to establish Artificial Life as a valid significant and exciting area of scientific research These efforts are not unrelated to the visual and verbal transformations discussed above To the extent that the creatures are biomorphized their representation reinforces the strong claim that the creatures are actually alive extending the implications of the claim Nor do the transformations appear only in the video although they are particu larly striking there As the discussion above demonstrates they are also in scribed in published articles and commentary In fact they are essential to the strong claim that the computer codes do not merely simulate life but are themselves alive At least some researchers at the Santa Fe Institute recognize the relation between the strong claim and the stories that re searchers tell about these organisms Asked about the strong claim one respondent insisted Its in the eye of the beholder Its not the system its the observer12 In the second wave of cybernetics accounting for the observer was of course a central concern What happens when the observer is taken into ac Narratives of Artificial Life  count in Artificial Life research To explore further the web of connections between the operations of the program descriptions ofits operation by ob servers and the contexts in which these descriptions are embedded we will follow the thread to the next narrative level where arguments circulate about the contributions that Artificial Life can make to scientific knowl edge Positioning the Field The Politics of Artificial Life Christopher Langton one of the most visible of the AL researchers ex plains the reasoning behind the strong claim The principle sic assump tion made in Artificial Life is that the logical form of an organism can be separated from its material basis of construction and that aliveness will be found to be a property of the former not of the latter131t would be easy to dismiss the claim on the basis that the reasoning behind it is tautological Langton defines life in such a way as to make su re the programs qualify and then because they qualify he claims they are alive But more is at work here than tautology Resonating through Langtons definition are assumptions that have marked Western philosophical and scientific inquiry at least since Plato Form can lOgically be separated from matter form is privileged over matter form defines life whereas the material basis merely instantiates life The definition is a site of reinscription as well as tautology This con vergence suggests that the context for our inquiry should be broadened be yond the logical form of the definition to the field of inquiry in which such arguments persuade precisely because they reinscribe This context includes attitudes held deeply by many researchers in sci entific communities about the relation between the complexity of observ able phenomena and the relatively simple rules they are seen to embody Traditionally the natural sciences especially physics have attempted to reduce apparent complexity to underlying simplicity The attempt to find the fundamental building blocks of the universe in quarks is one example of this endeavor the mapping of the human genome is another 14 The sci ences of complexity with their origins in nonlinear dynamiCS complicated this picture by demonstrating that for certain nonlinear dynamical systems the evolution of the system could not be predicted even in theory from the initial conditions just as Ray did not know what creatures would evolve from the ancestor Thus the sciences of complexity articulated a limit on what reductionism could accomplish In a significant sense however AL researchers have not relinquished reductionism In place of predictability which is traditionally the test of whether a theory works they emphasize 232  Chapter Nine emergence Instead of starting with a complex phenomenal world and rea soning back through chains ofinference to what the fundamental elements must be they start with the elements complicating the elements through appropriately nonlinear processes so that the complex phenomenal world appears on its own 15 What is the justification for calling the simulation and the phenomena that emerge from it a world It is precisely because they are generated from simple underlying rules and forms AL reinscribes then the main stream assumption that simple rules and forms give rise to phenomenal complexity The difference is that AL starts at the simple end where syn thesis can move forward spontaneously rather than at the complex end where analysis must work backward Langton in his explanation of what AL can contribute to theoretical biology makes this difference explicit Artificial Life is the study of manmade systems that exhibit behaviors characteristic of natural living systems It complements the traditional bio logical sciences concerned with the analysis of living organisms by at tempting to synthesize lifelike behaviors within computers and other artificial media By extending the empirical foundation upon which biology is based beyond the carbonchain life that has evolved on Earth Artificial Life can contribute to theoretical biology by locating lifeasweknowit within the larger picture oflifeasitcouldbe 16 The presuppositions informing such statements have been studied by Stefan Helmreich an anthropologist who spent several months at the Santa Fe Institute 17 Helmreich interviewed several of the major players in the U S AL community including Langton Ray John Holland and others Helmreich summarized his informants views about the worlds they cre ate For many of the people I interviewed a world or universe is a self consistent complete and closed system that is governed by low level laws that in tum support higher level phenomena which while dependent on these elementary laws cannot be simply derived from them18 Helmreich used comments from the interviews to paint a fascinating picture of the various ways in which simple laws are believed to underlie complex phenomena Several informants thought that the world was mathematical in essence Others held the view also extenSively articulated by Edward Fredkin that the world is fundamentally composed of information 19 From these points of view phenomenological experience is itself a kind of illusion covering an underlying reality of simple forms For these researchers a computer program that generates phenomenological com plexity out of simple forms is no more or less illusory than the real world The formmatter dichotomy is intimately related to this vision for real Narratives ol Artificial Life I ity at the fundamental level is seen as form rather than matter specifically as informational code whose essence lies in a binary choice rather than a material substrate Fredkin for example says that reality is a software pro gram run by a cosmic computer whose nature must forever remain un known to us because it lies outside the structure of reality whose programs it runs20 For Fredkin AL programs are alive in precisely the same sense as biolOgical lifebecause they are complex phenomena generated by un derlying binary code The assumption that form occupies a foundational position relative to matter is especially easy to make with information tech nologies since information is defined in theoretic terms as we have seen as a probability function and thus as a pattern or form rather than as a ma terially instantiated entity Information technologies seem to realize a dream impossible in the nat ural worldthe opportunity to look directly into the inner workings of re ality at its most elemental level The directness of the gaze does not derive from the absence of mediation On the contrary our ability to look into pro grams like Tierra is highly mediated by everything from computer graphiCS to the processing program that translates machine code into a highlevel computer language such as C Rather the gaze is privileged because the observer can peer directly into the elements of the world before the world cloaks itself with the appearance of complexity Moreover the ob server is presumed to be cut from the same doth as the world being in spected inasmuch as the observer is also constituted through binary processes similar to those seen inside the computer The essence of Tierra as an artificial world is no different from the essence of the observer or of the world that the observer occupies all are constituted through forms un derstood as informational patterns When form is triumphant Tierras creatures are in a disconcertingly literal sense just as much lifeforms as are any other organisms We are now in a position to understand the deep reasons why some prac titioners think of programs like Tierra not as models or simulations but as life itself As Langton and many others point out in the analytic approach reality is modeled by treating a complex phenomenon as if it was composed of smaller constituent parts These parts are broken down into still smaller parts until we find parts sufficiently Simplified that they can be treated mathematically Most scientists would be qUick to agree that the model is not the reality because they recognize that many complexities had to be tossed out by the wayside in order to lighten the wagon enough to get it over the rough places in the trail Their hope is that the model nevertheless cap tures enough of the relevant aspects of a system to tell them something sig 234  Chapter Nine nificant about how reality works In the synthetic approach by contrast the complexities emerge spontaneously as a result of the systems operation The system itself adds back in the baggage that had to be tossed out in the analytic approach Whether it is the same baggage remains of course to be seen In this sense Artificial Life poses an interesting challenge to the view of nineteenthcentury vitalists who saw in the analytic approach a reductionist methodology that could never adequately capture the com plexities of life If it is true that the analytical approach murders by dissec tion by the same reasoning the synthetic approach of AL may be able to procreate by emergence In addition to these philosophical considerations there are also more obviously political reasons to make a strong claim for the aliveness of Ar tificial Life As a new kid on the block AL must jockey for position with larger betterestablished research agendas A common reaction from other scientists is Well this is all very interesting but what good is it Even AL researchers joke that AL is a solution in search of a problem When applications are suggested they are often open to cogent objec tions As long as AL programs are considered to be simulations any results produced from them may be artifacts of the simulation rather than prop erties of natural systems So what if a certain result can be produced within the simulation The result is artifactual and therefore nonsignifying with respect to the natural world unless the same mechanisms can be shown to be at work in natural systems21 These difficulties disappear however if AL programs are themselves alive Then the point is not that they model natural systems but rather that they are in themselves also alive and therefore as worthy of study as evolutionary processes in naturally occur ring media This is the tack that Langton takes when he compares AL simulations to synthetic chemicals 22 In the early days he observes the study of chemistry was confined to naturally occurring elements and compounds Although some knowledge could be gained from these the results were limited by what lay ready at hand Once researchers learned to synthesize chemicals their knowledge took a quantum leap forward for then chemicals could be tailored to specific research problems Similarly theoretical biology has been limited to the cases that lie ready at hand namely the evolutionary pathways taken by carbonbased life Even though generalizing from a sin gle instance is notoriously difficult theoretical biology had no choice car bonbased life was it Now a powerful new instance has been added to the repertoire for AL simulations represent an alternative evolutionary path way followed by siliconbased lifeforms Narratives of Artificial Life  What theoretical biology looks for in this view are similarities that cut across the particularities of the media In Beyond Digital Naturalism Walter Fontana and his coauthors layout a research agenda ultimately motivated by a premise that there exists a logical deep structure of which carbon chemistrybased life is a manifestation The problem is to discover what it is and what the appropriate mathematical devices are to express it23 Such a research agenda presupposes that the essence oflife under stood as logical form is independent of the medium More is at stake in this agenda than expanding the frontiers of theoretical biology By positing AL as a second instance oflife researchers affect the definition of biological life as well for now it is the juxtaposition that determines what counts as fundamental not carbonbased forms by themselves This change hints at the farreaching implications of the narrative of Ar tificial Life as an alternate evolutionary pathway for life on Earth To ex plore these implications let us turn to the third level of narrative where we will consider stories about the relation of humans to our silicon cousins the Artificial Lifeforms that represent the road not takenuntil now Reconfiguring the Body of Information As research on Artificial Lifeforms continues and expands the construc tion of human life is affected as well Rodney Brooks of the Artificial Intel ligence Laboratory at MIT and the roboticist Hans Moravec noted in earlier chapters tell two different narratives of how the human will be re configured in the face of artificial bodies ofinformation Whereas Moravec privileges consciousness as the essence of human being and wants to pre serve it intact Brooks speculates that the more essential property of the hu man being is the ability to move around and interact robustly with the environment Instead of starting with the most advanced qualities ofhu man thought Brooks starts with locomotion and simple interactions and works from the bottom up Despite these different orientations both Brooks and Moravec see the future of human being inextricably bound up with Artificial Life Indeed in the future world they envision distinguish ing between natural and Artificial Life human and machine intelligence will be difficult or impossible In Mind Children The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence Moravec argues that the age of carbonbased life is drawing to a close 24 Humans are about to be replaced by intelligent machines as the dominant lifeform on the planet Drawing on the work of A C CairnsSmith Moravec suggests that such a revolution is not unprecedented25 Before protein replication developed a primitive form oflife existed in certain silicon crystals that had the ability to replicate But protein replication was so far superior that it soon left the replicating crystals in the dust Now silicon has caught up with us again in the form of computers and computerized robots Although the CairnsSmith hypothesis has been largely discredited in Moravecs text it serves the useful purpose of increasing the plausibility of his vision by pre senting the carbonsilicon struggle as a rematch of an earlier contest rather than as an entirely new event A different approach is advocated by other members of the AL commu nity among them Rodney Brooks Pattie Maes and Mark Tilden26 They point to the importance of having agents who can learn from interactions with a physical environment Simulations they believe are limited by the ar tificiality of their context Compared with the rich variety and creative sur prises of the natural world simulations are stick worlds populated by stick figures No one argues this case more persuasively than Brooks When I talked with him at his MIT laboratory he mentioned that he and Hans Moravec had been roommates in college a coincidence almost allegorical in its neatness Moravec for his senior project had built a robot that used a central representation of the world to navigate The robot would go a few feet feed in data from its sensors to the central representation map its new position and move a few more feet Using this process it would take several hours to cross a room If anyone came in during the meantime it would be thrown hopelessly off course Brooks a loyal roommate stayed up late one night to watch the robot as it carried out its agonizingly slow perambulation The thought occurred to Brooks that a cockroach could accomplish the same task in a fraction of the time and yet the cockroach could not pOSSibly have as much computing power aboard as the robot Deciding that there had to be a better way he began building robots according to a different philosophy In his robots Brooks uses what he calls subsumption architecture The idea is to have sensors and actuators connected directly to simple finite state machine modules with a minimum of communication between them Each system sees the world in a way that is entirely different from how the other systems see the world There is no central representation only a control system that kicks in to adjudicate when there is a conflict be tween the distributed modules Brooks points out that the robot does not need to have a coherent concept of the world instead it can learn what it needs directly through interaction with its environment The philosophy is summed up in his aphorism The world is its own best model27 Subsumption architecture is deSigned to facilitate and capitalize on emergent behavior The idea can be illustrated with Genghis a Sixlegged Narratives If Artificial Life  robot somewhat resembling an oversize cockroach which Brooks hopes to sell to NASA as a planetary explorer28 Genghiss gait is not programmed in advance Rather each of the six legs is programmed to stabilize itself in an environment that includes the other five Each time Genghis starts up it has to learn to walk anew For the first few seconds it will stumble around then as the legs begin to take account of what the others are doing a smooth gait emerges The robot is relatively cheap to build is more robust than the large planetary explorers that NASA currently uses and is under its own local control rather than being dependent on a central controller who may not be on site to see what is happening Fast cheap and out of control is another aphOrism that Brooks use to sum up the philosophy be hind the robots he builds Brookss program has been carried furthe r by Mark Tilden a Canadian roboticist who worked under Brooks and novv is at the University ofVater 100 In my conversation with him Tilden mentioned that he grew up on a farm in Canada and was struck by how chickens ran around after they their heads had been cut off performing as he likes to put it complicated navi gational tasks in threedimensional space vvithout any cortex at all He de cided that considerable computation had to be going on in the peripheral nervous system He used the insight to design insectlike robots that operate on nervous nets considerably simpler than the more complex neural nets composed of no more than twelve transistor circuits These robots use ana logue rather than digital computing to carry out their tasks Like Genghis they have an emergent gait They are remarkably robust are able to right themselves when turned over and can even learn a compensatory gait when one of their legs is bent or broken off 29 Narratives about the relation of these robots to humans emerge when Brooks and others speculate about the relevance of their work to human evolution Brooks acknowledges that the robots he builds have the equiv alent of insect intelligence But insect intelligence is he says nothing to sneer at Chronologically speaking by the time insects appeared on Earth evolution was already 95 percent of the way to creating human intelli gence30 The hard part he believes is evolving creatures who are mobile and who can interact robustly with their environment Once these quali ties are in place the rest comes relatively quickly including the sophisti cated cognitive abilities that humans possess How did humans evolve In his view they evolved through the same kind of mechanisms that he uses in his robots namely distributed systems that interact robustly with the environment and that consequently see the world in very different ways Consciousness is a relatively late development analogous to the control 238  Chapter Nine system that kicks in to adjudicate conHicts between the different distrib uted systems Consciousness is as Brooks likes to say a cheap tricK that is an emergent property that increases the functionality of the system but is not part of the systems essential architecture Consciousness does not need to be and in fact is not representational Like the robots control sys tem consciousness does not require an accurate picture of the world it needs only a reliable interface As evidence that human consciousness works this way Brooks adduces the fact that most adults are unaware that they go through life with a large blank spot in the middle of their visual field This reasoning leads to yet another aphOrism that circulates through the AL community Consciousness is an epiphenomenon The implication is that consciousness although it thinks it is the main show is in fact a late comer a phenomenon dependent on and arising from deeper and more es sential layers of perception and being The view is reminiscent of the comedian Emo Phillipss comment I used to think that the brain was the most wonderful organ in the body he says But then I thought whos telling me this It would be difficult to imagine a more contrarian position to the one that Hans Moravec espouses when he equates consciousness with human subjectivity In this respect Moravec aligns with Artificial Intelligence AI whereas Brooks and his colleagues align with Artificial Life AL31 Michael Dyer in his comparison of the two fields points out that whereas AI envisions cognition as the operation oflogic AL sees cognition as the op eration of nervous systems AI starts with humanlevel cognition AL with insect or animallevel cognition in AI cognition is constructed as ifinde pendent of perception whereas in AL it is integrated with sensorymotor experiences32 Brooks and his colleagues forcefully argue that AI has played itself out and that the successor paradigm is AL Brooks and Ray both believe that we will eventually be able usingAL techniques to evolve the equivalent ofhu man intelligence inside a computer For Brooks that project is already un der way with Cog a headandtorso robot with sophisticated visual and manipulative capability But AL researchers go about creating highlevel intelligence in ways dramatically different from those of AI researchers Consider the implications of this shift for the construction of the human The goal of AI was to build inside a machine an intelligence comparable to that of a human The human was the measure the machine was the attempt at instantiation in a different medium This assumption deeply informs the Turing test dating from the early days of the AI era which defined success Narratives of Artificial Life I human intelligence By contrast the goal of AL is to evolve intelligence within the machine through pathways found by the creatures them selves Rather than serving as the measure to judge success human intelli gence is itself reconfigured in the image of this evolutionary process Whereas AI dreamed of creating consciousness inside a machine AL sees human consciousness understood as an epiphenomenon perching on top of the machinelike functions that distributed systems carry out 33 In the AL paradigm the machine becomes the model for understanding the human Thus the human is transfigured into the posthuman To indicate the widespread reach of this refashioning of the human into the posthuman in the following section I want to sketch with broad strokes some of the research contributing to this project The sketch will necessar ily be incomplete Yet even this imperfect picture will be useful in indicat ing the scope of the posthuman So pervasive is this refashioning that it amounts to a newworldviewone still in process highly contested and of ten speculative yet with enough links between different sites to be edging toward a vision of what we might call the computational universe In the computational universe the essential function for both intelligent ma chines and humans is processing information Indeed the essential func tion of the universe as a whole is processing information In a way different from what Norbert Wiener imagined the computational universe realizes the cybernetic dream of creating a world in which humans and intelligent machines can both feel at home That equality derives from the view that not only our world but the great cosmos itselfis a vast computer and that we are the programs it runs The Computational Universe Let us start our tour of the computational universe at the most basic level the level that underlies all lifeforms indeed all matter and energy The units that compose this level are cellular automata From their simple on off functioning everything else is built up Cellular automata were first proposed by John von Neumann in his search to describe selfreproducing automata Influenced by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pittss work on the onoff functioning of the neural system von Neumann used the McCullochPitts neuron as a model for computers inventing Switching de vices that could perform the same kind oflogical functions that McCulloch had outlined for neurons Von Neumann also proposed that the neural sys tem could be treated as a Turing machine Biology thus provided him with 240  Chapter Nine clues to build computers and computers provided clues for theoretical bi ology To extend the analogy between biological organism and machine he imagined a giant automaton that could perform the essential biological function of selfreproduction34 As we saw in chapter 6 Maturana re ferred to this when he made the point that what von Neumann modeled were biologists descriptions of living processes rather than the processes themselves Stanislaw Vlam a Polish mathematician who worked with von Neumann at Los Alamos during World War II suggested to von Neumann that he could achieve the same result by abstracting the automaton into a grid of cells Thus von Neumann reduced the massive and resistant materiality of the selfreproducing automaton as he had originally envisioned it to undif ferentiated cells with bodies so transparent that they were constituted as squares marked off on graph paper and later as pixels on computer screens35 Each cellular automaton or CA functions as a simple finitestate ma chine with its state determined solely by its initial condition on or off by rules telling it how to operate and by the state of its neighbors at each mo ment For example the rule for one group of CAs might state On if two neighbors are on otherwise off Each cell checks on the state ofits neigh bors and updates its state in accordance with its rules at the same time that the neighboring cells also update their states In this way the grid of cells goes through one generation after another in a succession of states that on a computer can easily stretch to hundreds of thousands of generations Ex tremely complex patterns can build up emerging spontaneously from in teractions between the CAs Programmed into a computer and displayed on the screen CAs give the uncanny impression of being alive Some pat terns spread until they look like the deSigns of intricate Oriental rugs oth ers float across the screen like gliders and still others flourish only to die out within a few hundred generations Looking at the emergence of complex dynamical patterns from these simple components more than one re searcher has had the intuition that such a system can explain the growth and decay of patterns in the natural world Edward Fredkin took this inSight further seeing in cellular automata the foundational structure from which everything in the universe is built up How does this building up occur In the computational universe the question can be rephrased by asking how higherlevel computations can emerge spontaneously from the underlying structure of cellular automata Langton has done pioneering work analyzing the conditions under which cellular automata can support the fundamental operations of computation Narratives of Artificial Life  which he analyzes as requiring the transfer storage and modification ofin formation 36 His research indicates that computation is most likely to arise at the boundary between ordered structures and chaotic areas In an or dered area the cells are tightly tied together through rules that make them extremely interdependent it is precisely this interdependence that leads to order But the tightly ordered structure also means that the cells as an ag gregate will be unable to perform some of the essential tasks of higherlevel computation particularly the transfer and modification of information In a chaotic area by contrast the cells are relatively independent of one an other this independence is what makes them appear disordered Although this state lends itself to information transfer and modification here the storage of information is a problem because no pattern persists for long Only in boundary areas between chaos and order is there the necessary in novationlreplication tension that allows patterns to build up modify and travel over long distances without dying out These results are strikingly similar to those discovered by Stuart Kauff man in his work on the origins oflife Kauffman was McCullochs last pro tege in several interviews McCulloch said that he regarded Kauffman as his most important collaborator since Pitts37 Kauffman argues that natural selection alone is not enough to explain the relatively short timescale on which life arose38 Some other ordering principle is necessary which he locates in the ability of complex systems spontaneously to selforganize Calculating the conditions necessary for large molecules to organize spon taneously into the building blocks of life he found that life is most likely to arise at the edge of chaos This means that there is a striking correspon dence between the conditions under which life is likely to emerge and those under which computation is likely to emergea convergence re garded by many researchers as an unmistakable sign that computation and life are linked at a deep level In this view humans are programs that run on the cosmic computer When humans build intelligent computers to run AL programs they replicate in another medium the same processes that brought themselves into being An important reason why such connections can be made so eaSily be tween one level and another is that in the computational universe every thing is reducible at 801ne level to information Yet among proponents of the computational universe not everyone favors disembodiment just as they did not in the Macy Conferences when the idea of information was be ing formulated Consider for example the different approaches taken by Edward Fredkin and the new field of evolutionary psychology When Fred kin asserts that we can never know the nature of the cosmic computer on 242  Chapter Nine which we run as programs he puts the ultimate material embodiment out of our reach All we as human beings will ever see are the informational forms of pure binary code that he calls cellular automata By contrast the field of evolutionary psychology seeks to locate modular computer pro grams in embodied human beings whose physical makeup is the result of hundreds of thousands of years of evolutionary processes The agenda for this new field is set out by Jerome H Barkow Leda Cos mides and John Tooby in The Adapted Mind Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture Like Minksy they argue that the model or metaphor of computation provides the basis for a wholesale revision of what counts as human nature39 They aim to overcome cultural anthropol ogists and others objections to the idea of human nature by offering a more flexible version of how that nature is constituted They argue that be havior can be modeled as modular computer programs running in the brain The underlying structure of these programs is the result of thou sands of years of evolutionary tinkering Those adaptations that conferred superior reproductive fitness survived those that did not died out The pro grams are structured to enable certain functionalities to exist in humans and these functionalities are universally present in all humans These func tionalities however represent potentials rather than actualities Just as the actual behavior of a computer program is determined by a constant under lying structure and varying inputs so actual human behavior results from an interplay between the potential represented by the functionalities and the inputs provided by the environments All normal human infants for ex ample have the potential to learn language If they are not exposed to lan guage by a certain critical age however this potential disappears and they can never become linguistically competent Although human behavior varies across a wide spectrum of actualization it nevertheless has an un derlying universal structure determined by evolutionary adaptations Thus a science of evolutionary psychology is possible for the existence of a uni versal underlying structure guarantees the regularities that any science needs in order to formulate coherent and consistent knowledge This cyberneticcomputer vision of human behavior leads to a very dif ferent account of human nature Although the evolutionary programs that the braincomputer runs do not lead to universal behavior they are nevertheless rich with content The potentials lie not just in the structure of the general machine but much more specifically in the environmentally adaptive programs that proactively shape human responses Thus children are not merely capable oflearning language they actively want to learn lan guage and will invent it among themselves if no one teaches them40 Like Narratives of Artificial Life I Wieners cybernetic machine the cybernetic brain is responsive to the flow of events around it and is adaptive over an astonishingly diverse set of cir cumstances The fact that only the intelligent machine is seen to be light enough on its feet to do justice to human variability is a measure of just how much our vision of machines has changed since the Industrial Revolution It will now perhaps be clear why the most prized functionality is the abil ityto process information forin the computational universe information is king Luc Steels an AL researcher reinscribes this value when he distin guishes between firstorder emergence and secondorder emergence surely it is no accident that the terminology here echoes the distinction be tween first order cybernetics and secondorder cybernetics the grandpar ent and parent of Artificial Life Firstorder emergence denotes any properties that are generated by interactions between components that is properties that emerge as a result of those interactions in contrast to prop erties inherent in the components themselves Among all such emergent properties secondorder emergence grants speCial privilege to those that bestow additional functionality on the system particularly the ability to process information41 To create successfill Artificial Life programs it is not enough to create just any emergence Rather the programmer searches for a design that will lead to secondorder emergence Once secondorder emergence is achieved the organism has in effect evolved the capacity to evolve Then evolution can really take off Humans evolved through a combination of chance and selforganizing processes until they reached the point where they could take conscious advantage of the princi ples of selforganization to create evolutionary mechanisms They used this ability to build machines capable of selfevolution Unlike humans how ever the machine programs are not hampered by the time restrictions imposed by biolOgical evolution and physical maturation They can run through hundreds of generations in a day millions in a year Until very re cently humans have been without peer in their ability to store transmit and manipulate information Now they share that ability with intelligent machines To foresee the future of this evolutionary path we have only to ask which of these organisms competing in many ways for the same evolu tionary niche has the informationprocessing capability to evolve more qUickly This conclusion makes clear I think why the computational universe should not be accepted unCritically If the name of the game is processing information it is only a matter of time until intelligent machines replace us as our evolutionary heirs Whether we decide to fight them or join them by becoming computers ourselves the days of the human race are numbered 244  Chapter Nine The problem here does not lie in the choice between these options rather it lies in the framework constructed so as to make these options the only two available The computational universe becomes dangerous when it goes from being a useful heuristic to an ideology that privileges information over everything else As we have seen information is a socially constructed con cept in addition to its currently accepted definition it could have been and was given different definitions Just because information has lost its body does not mean that humans and the world have lost theirs Fortunately not all theorists agree that it makes sense to think about in formation as an entity apart from the medium that embodies it Let us re visit some of the sites in the computational universe this time to locate those places where the resistance of materiality does useful work within the theories From this perspective fracture lines appear that demystify the programs and make it possible to envision other futures futures in which human beings feel at home in the universe because they are embodied creatures living in an em bodied world Murmurs from the Body One of the striking differences between researchers who work with flesh and those who work with computers is how nuanced the sense of the bodys complexity is for those who are directly engaged with it The difference can be seen in the contrast between Marvin Minskys society of mind ap proach and the approach of the evolutionary psychologists Although Min sky frequently uses evolutionary arguments to clarifY the structure of a program his main interest clearly lies in bUilding computer models that can accomplish human behaviors 42 He characteristically thinks in terms of computer architecture about which he knows a great deal rather than hu man physiology In his lectures and less so in his writing he rivals Moravec in his consistent downplaying of the importance of embodiment At the public lecture he delivered in 1996 on the eve of the Fifth Conference on Artificial Life in Nara Japan he argued that only with the advent of com puter languages has a symbolic mode of description arisen adequate to ac count for human beings whom he defines as complicated machines A person is not a head and arms and legs he remarked Thats trivial A per son is a very large multiprocessor with a million times a million small parts and these are arranged as a thousand computers It is not surprising then that he shares with Moravec the dream of banishing death by downloading consciousness into a computer The most important thing about each per son is the data and the programs in the data that are in the brain And some Narratives of Artificial Life  day you will be able to take all that data and put it on a little disk and store it for a thousand years and then tum it on again and you will be alive in the fourth millennium or the fifth millennium4l Yet anyone who actually works with embodied forms from the relatively simple architecture of robots to the vastly more complicated workings of the human neural system knows that it is by no means trivial to deal with the resistant materialities of embodiment To Minsky these problems of embodiment are nuisances that do not even have the virtue of being con ceptually interesting In his plenary lecture at the Fifth Conference on Ar tificial Life he asserted that a student who constructed a simulation of robot motion learned more in six months than the roboticists did in six years of building actual robots44 Certainly simulations are useful for a wide range of problems for they abstract a few features out of a complex inter active whole and then manipulate those features to get a better under standing of what is going on Compared with the real world they are more efficient precisely because they are more Simplified The problem comes when this mode of operation is taken to be fully representative of a much more complex reality and when everything that is not in the simulation is declared to be trivial unimportant or uninteresting Like Varela in his criticisms and modifications of Minskys model dis cussed in chapter 6 Barkow Tooby and Cosmides are careful not to make this mistake They acknowledge that the mindbody duality is a social con struction that obscures the holistic nature of human experience Another researcher who speaks powerfully to the importance of embodiment is An tonio Damasio in Descartes Error Enwtion Reason and the Human Brain Discussing the complex mechanisms by which mind and body com municate he emphasizes that the body is more than a lifesupport system for the brain The body contributes a content that is part and parcel of the workings of the normal mind45 Drawing on his detailed knowledge of neurophysiology and his years of experience working with patients who have suffered neural damage he argues that feelings constitute a window through which the mind looks into the body Feelings are how the body communicates to the mind information about its structure and continu ously varying states If feelings and emotions are the body murmuring to the mind then feelings are just as cognitive as other precepts part of thought and indeed part of what makes us rational creatures p xv Damasio finds it significant that cognitive science with its computational approach to mind has largely ignored the fact that feelings even exist with some notable exceptions such as The Embodied Mind discussed in chap ter 6 One can guess what his response to the scenario of downloading hu man consciousness would be from the following passage In brief neural circuits represent the organism continuously as it is perturbed by stimuli from the physical and sociocultural environments and as it acts on those environments If the basic topic of those representations were not an or ganism anchored in the body we might have some form of mind but I doubt that it would be the mind we do have p 226 Human mind without human body is not human mind More to the point it doesnt exist What are we to make then of the posthuman As the liberal humanist subject is dismantled many parties are contesting to determine what will count as posthuman in its wake For most of the researchers discussed in this chapter becoming a posthuman means much more than having pros thetic devices grafted onto ones body It means envisioning humans as in formationprocessing machines with fundamental similarities to other kinds of informationprocessing machines especially intelligent comput ers Because of how information has been defined many people holding this view tend to put materiality on one side of a divide and information on the other side making it possible to think of information as a kind of imma terial fluid that circulates effortlessly around the globe while still retaining the solidity of a reified concept Yetthis is notthe only view and in my judg ment it is not the most compelling one Other voices insist that the body cannot be left behind that the specificities of embodiment matter that mind and body are finally the unity that Maturana insisted on rather than two separate entities Increasingly the question is not whether we will be come posthuman for posthumanity is already here Rather the question is what kind of posthumans we will be The narratives of Artificial Life reveal that if we acknowledge that the observer must be part of the picture bodies can never be made of information alone no matter which sine of the com puter screen they are on  Chaprer  Te  n THE SEMIOTICS OF VIRTUALITY MAPPING THE POSTHUMAN Over twenty years ago Ihab Hassan prescient as usual predicted the ar rival of the posthuman We need first to understand that the human formincluding human desire and all its external representationsmay be changing radically and thus must be revisioned  five hundred years of humanism may be coming to an end as humanism transforms itself into something we must helplessly call posthumanisml As we accelerate into the new millennium questions about the posthuman become increasingly urgent Nowhere are these questions explored more passionately than in contemporary speculative fiction This chapter returns to terms previously introduced to show how they can be used to map the posthuman as a liter ary phenomenon The truism that the map is not the territory is especially so in this instance for the posthuman although still a nascent concept is already so complex that it involves a range of cultural and technical sites including nanotechnology microbiology virtual reality artificial life neurophysiology artificial intelligence and cognitive science among others Nevertheless even a crude map may serve as a useful heuristic in understanding the axes along which the posthuman is unfolding and the deep issues the posthuman raises To construct the map I return to the idea that the two central dialectics involved in the formation of the posthuman are presence absence and pat ternlrandomness In chapter 2 I suggested that as information becomes more important the dialectic of patternrandomness with which infor mation has deep ties tends toward ascendancy over the dialectic of pres enceabsence It would be a mistake to think that the presenceabsence dialectic no longer has explanatory power however for it connects materi ality and signification in ways not possible within the patternrandomness dialectic To be useful the map of the posthuman needs to contain both di 248  Chapter Ten alectics Thus I pick up here the clue dropped at the end of chapter 2 that patternrandomness can profitably be seen as complementary to pres enceabsence rather than as antagonistic Conjoining the two dialectics in this chapter will also allow us to explore the full complexities of the theoret ical framework proposed in chapter 8 of embodimentbody and incorpo rationinscription Let us begin by considering the patternrandomness and presenceab sence dialectics as the two axes of a semiotic square The semiotic square appeals to me as a heuristic because ofits unusual combination of structure and flexibility 2 The structure is defined by the axes and the formal relation ships they express but the terms composing those axes are not static Rather they interact dynamically with their partners and out of these in teractions new synthetic terms can arise The dialectics can be set in motion by placing presence absence along the primary axis with patternrandom ness located along the secondary axis The relation of the secondary axis to the primary axis is one of exclusion rather than opposition see figure 2 Patternrandomness tells a part of the story that cannot be told through presenceabsence and vice versa The diagonal connecting presence and pattern can conveniently be labeled replication for it points to continua tion An entity that is present continues to be so a pattern repeating itself across time and space continues to replicate itself By contrast the axis con necting absence and randomness signals disruption Absence disrupts the illusion of presence revealing its lack of originary plenitude Randomness tears holes in pattern allowing the white noise of the background to pour through N ow we are ready to set the semiotic square in dynamiC motion Out of the interplay between and among terms on the primary and secondary axes more dialectics can be produced which in tum produce further dialectics Presence Absence disruption7_1   replication Randomness           Pattern FIGURE 2 The semiotics of virtuality The Semiotics of Virtuality I and so on indefinitely For my purposes here it will be sufficient to move through one of these transformations by adding a layer of synthesizing terms to the original square see figure 3 On the top horizontal the synthetic term that emerges from the inter play between presence and absence is materiality I mean the term to refer both to the signifYing power of materialities and to the materiality of signi fYing processes On the left vertical the interplay between presence and randomness gives rise to mutation Mutation testifies to the mark that ran domness leaves upon presence When a random event intervenes to affect an organisms genetic code for example this intervention changes the material form in which the organism will manifest itself in the world In chapter 2 mutation was associated with the displacement of presence absence by patternrandomness Here it appears as a synthesizing term between randomness and presence to indicate that when randomness erupts into the material world mutation achieves its potency as a social and cultural manifestation of the posthuman On the right vertical the in terplay between absence and pattern can be called following Jean Bau drillard hyperreality Predicting the imploSion of the social into the hyperreal Baudrillard has described the process as a collapse of the dis Materiality Mutation Hyperreality Information FIGURE 3 Transformation of the semiotic square 250  Chapter Ten tance between signifier and signified or between an original object and its simulacra The terminus for this train of thought is a simulation that does not merely compete with but actually displaces the original Anyone who has spent a lifetime seeing reproductions of the Mona Lisa and then stood before the original seeing it now not as the original but simply as one more term in a reproduction of images will understand intuitively the process that Baudrillard calls the precession of simulacra 3 Finally on the bottom horizontal the interplay between pattern and randomness I will label information intending the term to include both the technical mean ing of information and the more general perception that information is a code carried by physical markers but also extractable from them The schematic shows how concepts important to the posthumanmateriality information mutation and hyperrealitycan be understood as synthetic terms emerging from the dialectics between presenceabsence and pat ternrandomness To flesh out this schematic I will take as my tutor texts four novels cho sen to illustrate various articulations of the posthuman see figure 44 Each pair of texts can be represented through a pair of complementary ques tions Representing mutation is Greg Bears Blood Music a narrative in which the posthuman emerges by radically reconfiguring human bodies Paired with it along the horizontal axis is Cole Perrimans Terminal Games a murder mystery in which the murderer turns out to be a virtual con Body Boundaries Problematized Mutation Blood Music Modes of I nscription Problematized Materiality

is more real than the material world inhabited by the humans Both are driven by anxiety about body boundaries a theme familiar to us from scientific works such as Norbert Wieners Cybernetics and Humberto Maturanas autopoiesis and from literary works such as Bernard Wolfes Limbo and Philip K Dicks Simulacra Blood Music asks What if humans were taken over by their component parts functioning now as conscious entities themselves Ter minal Games asks the complementary question What if humans were made to function as if they were components of another entity On the vertical axis illustrating the dynamiCS of materiality is Richard Powerss Galatea 22 an autobiographical novel in which the protagonist becomes involved in a project to create a neural net sophisticated enough to pass a masters examination in English literature Here the posthuman takes the form of a sympathetic artificial intelligence that finally becomes so complex and selfreferential that it might as well be called conscious The question this text asks is What if a computer behaved like a person The dynamiCS of information is explored through Neal Stephensons Snow Crash a novel based on the premise that a computer virus can also infect humans crashing their neocortical software and turning them into mecha nized entities who have no choice but to run the programs fed into them The complementary question this text poses is What if people were made to behave as if they were computers Whereas the question of body boundaries figures importantly along the horizontal axis here along the vertical axis the important questions are concerned with modes of inscrip tion and their ability to dominate or substitute for the flesh As the shape of a landscape emerges from the wireframe abstractions of the model it will become evident that there is no consensus on what the posthuman portends in part because how the posthuman is constructed and imagined varies so widely What the topology will reveal is not so much an answer to the deep question of how the human and the posthuman should be articulated together as the complexity of the contexts within which that question is being posed Let us turn now to a discussion of the in dividual texts where an array of different configurations of the posthuman will be articulated The posthuman appears in these texts not as an abstract entity obeying general rules but as a heterogeneous force field through which certain vectors run I have chosen not to weave the discussions into a seamless web lest I make the posthuman appear more unified than it is Rather the discussions are meant to perform like hypertext lexias inviting the reader to construct Significance out of ruptures juxtapositions and im plied links  Chapter Ten The Mutating Bodies of Blood Music Vergil Ulam is a brilliant but irresponsible researcher who has found a way to combine human cells with computer chips His name an amalgam of Dantes guide Vergil and the cocreator of the atom bomb Stanislaw Ulam hints at his dual function as guide and provocateur Panicked when his illicit research is discovered by his supervisors Vergil decides to swallow the biochips hoping in this way to smuggle them out of the lab and retrieve them later from his bloodstream But the cells have other ideas Inside his body they continue to evolve until each cell is as intelligent as a human As if fulfilling Wieners nightmare vision of communication paths between small internal units that bypass and sabotage the human subject the cells increasingly gain control over their macroscopic host Already highly orga nized they begin rearranging his body rebuilding his spinal column cor recting his vision changing his metabolism Within a few days they break through the bloodbrain barrier and realize that Vergil is not coextensive with the universe Then they begin leaking through his skin to colonize the world outside In a stunningly short time they reorganize almost all of the human population of North America converting the humans from au tonomous organisms into flowing brown sheets that drape gracefully over the landscape Human language has encoded within it along many vectors the presup position of a human actor with agency autonomy and discrete boundaries When the cells become speakers as well as actors Greg Bear tries to invent for them a language and a typography that encode their profoundly differ ent relations to each other and to their environment Other than Vergil they have two interlocutors One is Michael Bernard a highlevel consul tant for Vergils company Bernard flees to a highsecurity isolation ward at a European biological research company Although he is already infected the cells delay reorganizing him trapped inside the isolation room they would not be able to join with other cell colonies In North America the hu mancell dialogue is continued through Suzy McKenzie a retarded woman whom the cells have not converted Although she thinks it might be be cause they want to keep her as a specimen of a nearly vanished species like an animal in a zoo BM p 220 we find out it is because her retardation is associated with an unusual blood chemistry that the cells have not yet fig uredout For Suzy the dialogue takes the form of conversations she has with fam ily members who return to her after they have changed No longer hu man these posthumans are reconstructions that the cells have built with The Semiotics of Virtuality  great effort and that they can sustain for only a short time The reconstruc tions suggest that Suzy can choose whether she wants to change or not The dialogue thus becomes a vehicle through which the author can compare the relative advantages of human and posthuman states The reconstruc tions reassure Suzy about the change telling her that she has nothing to lose but her loneliness These posthumans insist they have not been de stroyed only mutated so that they now can have continuous and rich com munication with millions of other intelligent beings Slower than her fellow humans Suzy has felt isolated and alone most of her life Her situation ac centuated by the fact that there are almost no other humans left on North America comes to function as a metaphor for the human condition By comparison with the combined mental power of the cells humans are an inferior breed suffering from mental deficiency and a congenital inability to communicate with their fellows except in highly mediated and uncertain ways In this sense we are all Suzys clinging to our autonomy as if it were an addictive drug suffering acutely from loneliness but too stubborn and slow to accept the change that would transform us into the posthuman For Bernard as intelligent and quick as Suzyis slow and bewildered the dialogues take a different form As Vergil did Bernard hears the cells telepathically and senses them kinesthetically as a music in his blood Since there is no percentage in changing him the cells try to preserve his identity for as long as pOSSible You already are one of us they communicate to him We have encoded parts of you into many teams for processing We can encode your PERSONALITY and complete the loop Bernard con fesses Tm afraid you will steal my soul from inside They counter Your SOUL is already encoded BM p 174 The isolation room in which he is encapsulated serves as a visible metonymy for his existential condition as a human His case is exceptional because he is literally cut off from his fellow humans but it is typical in the sense that compared with the rich stream of continuous communication the cells experience all humans remain in rel ative isolation from one another Faced with a lifetime sentence of isolation versus life as a cell colony Bernardlike Suzydecides to go willingly into that dark night From his computer terminal which gradually be comes merged with his body as the cells reorganize his digits so that he can tap directly into the digital information flow he sends back reports to his oncefellow humans on what it feels like to become a posthuman There is no light but there is sound It fills him in great sluggish waves not heard but felt through his hundred cells The cells pulse separate contract according to the rush of fluid He is in his own blood He can taste the presence of the cells making up his new being and of cells not directly part of him He can 251 I Chapter Ten feel the rasping of microtubules propelling his cytoplasm What is most re markable he can feelindeed it is the ground of all sensationthe cyto plasm itself BM p 189 The scene recalls Maturanas insistence that humans are nothing other than their autopoietic processes But alien to Maturanas vision is the im perative to change that dominates this plot All along the cells have been warning Bernard that they can hold off from transforming him for only so long Their compulsive drive toward expansion and transformation recalls the capitalist imperative to keep the cycle of increasing consumption spin ning lest the economy collapse under its own weight The cells may not manifest possessive individualism but they act like good capitalists in com pulsively seeking new territories for their imperialistic expansion5 Despite the focus on changes in embodiment the scientists in the text proclaim that information is the essence of reality as if to confirm that the final reality here is the computational universe Gogarty a mathematician who visits Bernard while he is in isolation announces There is nothing Michael but information All particles all energy even space and time it self are ultimately nothing but information BM p 177 The hypothesis that Gogarty has come to share with Bernard is a weirdscience blend of the Uncertainty Principle and social constructivism Consciousness and the universe collaborate in determining the laws of nature Until now the den sity of consciousness on Earth has not been great enough to cause appre ciable effects But with a billion trillion intelligent cells inhabiting the planet neglecting Gogarty The Semiotics of Virtuality I tion of the posthuman Even in this text concerned primarily with mutating bodies information is still seen as the native language of the universe When the cells interact they effectively become like Edward Fredkins cel lular automata moving toward a state in which they will leave their bodies behind and become weightless information Why is this text able to depict the transformation into the posthuman as a positive development It can do this I think primarily because the text insists that the posthuman can not only heal the alienations that mark human subjectivity but preserve autonomy and individuality in the bar gain Early on when Vergil still has a human though mutating form he communicates with the cells enough to have opinions about what their ex istence is like Although rebellion of any kind is not tolerated antibodies simply attack and kill any cells that resist commands from central control Vergil somewhat incoherently insists Its not just a dictatorship I think they effectively have more freedom than we do They vary so differently BM p 72 As Bernard is shrinking down to cellular proportions the cells conduct him to the THOUGHT UNIVERSE where he encounters Dante like the shade of Vergil For Bernards benefit the noocyte cluster that used to be Vergil resurrects an image ofVergil with whom Bernard con verses The picture this reconstmcted Vergil paints of the cell world is par adisical indeed Experience is generated by thinking We can be whatever we wish or learn whatever we wish or think about anything We wont be limited by lack of knowledge or experience everything can be brought to us BM pp 2034 These claims excessive even by utopian standards make clear why Darko Suvin calls Blood Music a naive fairytale catering to popular wish dreams that our loved ones not be dead and that our past mistakes may all be rectified all of this infused with rather dubious philo sophical and political stances6 An additional wishdream is immortality As every biologist knows mortality for cells operates according to mles very different from those for macroscopic humans it is conceivable that traces of cytoplasm from the first humans are alive in daughter cells today Bernard responds to the cells deSCription of him as the cluster chosen to reintegrate with BERNARD by asserting I am Bernard The cells answer There are many BERNARD BM p 199 In this cultural imaginary the sacrifice of a unique identity scarcely seems too high a price to pay for the incredible benefits that one reaps in return The theme is introduced early in the narrative through Jerry and John twin brothers who like Suzy remain unchanged for reasons they dont understand Aside from meeting up with April Ulam Vergils mother the twins seem to have wandered down a blind alley of the plot be 256  Chaprer Ten cause their story goes nowhere Their function I suspect is to introduce the notion that some humans already experience a version of multiplied identity Hell you are me brother one says to the other Minor differ ences BM p 149 The theme returns when Suzy looking into a mirror sees the image step out and take her hand so that she wont be alone during her change The image no mere apparition is a cellular reconstruction They had copied her Xeroxed her Suzythinks BM p 245 Sister twin daughter the cellcopy comforts and guides Suzy intimating that the loss of unique identity is perhaps no real loss at all Although human form and uniqueness are jettisoned the posthuman is embraced in Blood Music because it is made to stand for an improbably idealized combination of identity individuality perfect community flaw less communication and immortality The change of scale signifies a shift rather than an overthrow of prevailing values The liberal humanist subject may have shrunk to microscopic dimensions but it has not entirely disap peared The Hyperreality of Terminal Games The plot of Terminal Games revolves around a temporal and spatial dislo cation Murders are committed then reenacted as simulations the follow ing night on a virtualreality network called Insomnimania deSigned as the name implies for those people who find themselves wide awake at 3 AM with no one to talk to and nowhere to go Insomnimaniahas graphic ca pabilities so that users can represent themselves within the virtual world with animated images called in this text alters better known elsewhere as avatars Insomnimania presents its subscribers with an online virtual world complete with Ernies Bar Babbage Beach and the Pleasure Dome where users can guide their alters through virtual sex The detective as signed to the murder cases Nolan Grobowski predictably falls in love with the classy and attractive Marianne Hedison whose best friend Renee was one of the murder victims Marianne like Renee is a member ofInsomni mania she is also the first to realize that the elaborate animations put on by an alter named Auggie in the virtual Snuff Room are reenactments of actual murders including details that only the murderer could have known The grotesquerie is heightened by Auggies appearance His image is a cartoon version of the classic trickster clown Auguste who delights in puncturing the authOrity of the officious clownleader Pierriot The search for Auggies operator leads to the network headquarters where the two hackerowners refuse to reveal the identity of the subscriber The Semiotics of Virtuality  who uses Auggie as his alter having advertised their service with the pledge Your actual identity is protected at all times TG p 45 Asked which is more important information or human lives they answer in uni son Information Their reasoning sounds like a combination of the Elec tronic Freedom Frontier and Hans Moravec One of these days the human race is gonna vacate the physicaltemporal world ofmeat existence altogether Then well become pure information and live in these things call it virtual reality cyberspace electronic nirvana or whatever When we do youll thank me that Big Brother didnt get there ahead of the rest of us TG p 169 The reader is scarcely surprised when Marianne convinces them otherwise however for this is a text deSigned preCisely to protect the liberal humanist subject from the threat of transformation into the posthu man The motto about protecting identity at all times is even truer of the narrative than of the network As Marianne and Nolan slowly realize Auggie has no single human op erator but rather functions as an autonomous being in the virtual world When he isnt cruising Ernies Bar or basking on Babbage Beach Auggie hangs out in a place he calls the Basement After several futile tries Mari anne finally succeeds in guessing the password that will gain her entrance to the Basement Auggie is Auggie There she discovers how Auggie works Certain users especially those who feel hollow inside are susceptible to seduction by Auggie When they enter the Basement they lose their iden tities You do not even know your name the narrator tells the semicon sciousness who used to be Marianne TG p 423 These users merge into a collective entity that has no face until it sits down in front of a mirror and puts on the clown makeup Auggie is thus an emergent posthuman con sciousness feeding off the combined subconscious of psychologically vul nerable users When Auggie decides to do something one of them later explains during a confession I sometimes move him around Ifhe wants to say something I sometimes type in his words TG p 367 Under hypno sis the perpetrator continues to insist that agency belongs to Auggie not to him Because Im just a cell A cell doesnt make decisions A cell doesnt understand TG p 371 Whereas in Blood Music cells take over human bodies in Terminal Games humans become cells in Auggies body Terminal Games opens with an epigraph from Wieners The Human Use of Human Beings Control in other words is nothing but the sending of messages which effectively change the behavior of the recipient By giving control to Auggie the text enacts the posthuman use of human beings It performs Wieners worst nightmare human beings who should be au tonomous subjects become encapsulated within the boundaries of the ma 258  Chapter Ten chine and are made to serve its purposes rather than their own As in Blood Music the question of boundaries is crucial Subsuming humans into him self Auggie establishes his autonomy at the expense of theirs Another highly charged boundary is the computer screen that separates actuality from virtuality For Auggie the virtual side is real whereas real ity he regards as a not very convincing simulation For the humans the screen not only marks the boundary between actuality and virtuality but also shimmers suggestively between conscious and subconscious Cole Perriman here plays with Daniel Dennetts idea that when schizophrenics hear voices they actually hear their own subvocalizations 7 In this view the voices that schizophrenics understand as others speaking to them are actu ally murmurs produced by their own bodies Dennett recounts cases in which a schizophrenic in the midst of an auditory hallucination was asked to open his mouth thus preventing subvocalization whereupon the voices disappearedinterrupting the internal monologue with a disruption that would surely have won the approval of William Burroughs These experi ments allow Perriman to set a link between the auditory hallucinations of schizophrenia and the normal activity at the computer terminal Insomni maniacs write the texts that their alters mouth in a highly abbreviated prose bristling with creative spelling So cryptic is this phonetic pseudoEnglish that reading it successfully almost requires subvocalization It makes sense then to imagine that the users espeCially when they are tired remember they are insomniacs subvocalize and begin to hear voices from the screen as they project subconscious anxieties desires and even alternate person alities onto their alters When Renee is killed Marianne tries to cope with her loss by recreat ing Renee as an alter in Insomnimania In her long conversations with this virtual Renee Renee knows facts that Marianne does not such as the proper names for cloud formations Renee also delivers warnings at a time when Marianne is not aware at least not conSCiously that she can actually be harmed in the virtual world If you let this machinethis worldplay with your head you could wind up in terrible danger  Somebody else out there wants to make you smaller They want to make you a figment of their imaginationjust like I am to you TG p 385 In keeping with the idea that the mechanism of subvocalization serves to animate the alters the struggle over boundaries is played out partly in au ditory terms Marianne reenters the Basement but this time she is able to keep her consciousness from submerging into Auggies identity She in tends to deliver a message so potent so powerful that it would disable or destroy him She imagines that the message will seem to him like the The Semiotics of Virtuality I voices heard by schizophrenics She intends to become Auggies halluci nation TG p 438 The message turns on the question of boundaries The Insomnimania network comes on at 8 PM and goes off precisely at 5 AM Since Auggie does not exist when the network is turned off he believes that 459 is fol lowed by 800 Marianne asserts that she will prove there is time in between 459 and 800 The clear implication is that her world encapsulates Auggies rather than the other way around If this were so Auggie responds he would choose not to exist TG p 443 The reader knows that Marianne has already persuaded the network owners to keep the network on five min utes past the usual shutdown time As five 0 clock appears and rolls past Auggie is forced to see himself as a prisoner of the network rather than as a creator of the world Trapped his screen image explodes into a blaze of whiteness and then goes black TG p 444 We presume as does Mari anne that he has selfdestructed But he does not just disappear Musing on why not I am reminded of Elaine Scarrys provocative question asking why wars cant be decided by say singing contests8 Why are wounded or dead bodies required to decide momentous issues Scarry hypothesizes that any great issue involves a clash of ideolOgies and ideology is certainly at stake in the struggle of the human with the posthuman PreCisely because in wartime a national ide ology is challenged by a powerful competitor the chain of significations that underwrites the ideology is destabilized The wounded or dead body serves as a material Signifier so elemental and profound that it and only it is adequate to restabilize the chain of signifiers in the face of extreme threat This function of the opened body is hinted at early in the narrative of Terminal Garnes when Nolan views one of Auggies victims the dead per sons windpipe gaping open carotid arteries severed The word that crosses Nolans mind is tremendum that uniquely selfconscious uniquely hu man horror and awe at the Sight of a corpse  It was the ghastly mortal comprehension of the fact of the deathand the awareness that death came to all TG p 11 When Marianne argues with Auggie telling him it is wrong to kill my kind he answers that he does not believe that she can be killed since in his view she is not alive in the first place The final physi cal struggle with its display of wounded and opened bodies is a way to an chor the ideology of the human in tremendum and not COincidentally to reconstitute the claim after Auggies attack on it that human life is pre cious because it is mortal The theme of unique human identity is visually underscored when two of Auggies cells showup at Mariannes house to kill her Since their minds 260  Chapter Ten have submerged into Auggies their actions like their costumes are iden tical When they spot each other they mime a dance in unison as if they were each confronting an image in a mirror Unlike the image who steps out of the mirror to comfort Suzy in Blood Music here the trope of replication is deeply threatening Having once been part of Auggie Marianne must fight against getting sucked in now to become part of Auggies conscious ness Her struggle is visually enacted as she first joins the Auggietwins in their miming then breaks away to perform actions they cannot anticipate The struggle of the human to preserve itself in the face of the posthuman is thus literally played out through the performance of becoming a unique in dividual rather than a mirrorimage cell The physical fight that follows points up the difference between incor porating and inscribing practices As a virtual being Auggie exists primar ilyas an inscription specifically as computer code When his consciousness takes over a cell he perceives it as a journey into the fake world of mater ial reality His subsumption of the cells into his virtual body represents a triumph ofinscription over incorporation Human survival takes shape as a struggle to determine whether inscription will dominate and control incor poration in which case the text remains in the realm of information and thus the posthuman triumphs the other happier possibility is that incor poration can subsume and delimit inscription in which case the text re mains in an embodied lifeworld in which the human can continue to live As in Blood Music the question of boundaries is crucial The cells in Blood Music finally escape the constraints of space by shrinking themselves and disappearing into the infinitely small Their control over boundaries is con sistent with their autonomy and independence By contrast when Auggie loses control over his cells he perceives himself fragmenting into bits with small parts of his personality trapped inside the various humans who had previously coalesced into a single entity Fleeing the scene of carnage at Mariannes house Auggie occupies one of his cells a woman who re turns to her car He panics as the suspicion dawns that these enclosures the car the woman and the world of embodied creaturesare not merely figments of his imagination But this ghastly imagined world in which he found himself was cramped and claustrophobic a realm of spacetime bent by hunks of matter into gross finitude  He longed to get out of this sin gle cell out of this minuscule outpost of his imagination He struggled to go back to the info world back to the Basement a boundless plain of uncut metaphor containing the essence of absolutely everything TG p 457 He dies shouting N a room a conclusion that Signals the victory of the human over the posthuman and not coincidentally the triumph of the ma The Semiotics of Virtualitv I info world Whereas Blood Music held out the promise of posthuman immortality Terminal Games remains resolutely on the side of finitude Humans are human because they are mortal and live in a finite world oflim ited resources Change this Terminal Games implies and the basis for hu man meaning is destroyed Intelligent machines can be accepted the trajectory of the plot implies only if they do not threaten the autonomy identity and finitude of human being When the posthuman is posited in opposition to these qualities it is constructed as a fatal threat that reason and love must work together to dismember and banish Material Signifiers in Galatea 22 As the title implies Galatea 22 is full of doublings starting with the dou bling of Richard Powers as author and as protagonist of this autobiographi cal novel Yet the doublings are never simply mirror images The dot separating the twin twos signifies difference as well as reflection Announc ing the theme with the first line the narrator whom I will call Rick to dis tinguish him from Powers the author proclaims It was like so but wasnt G2 p 3 Spending a sabbatical year at the Center a university institute where cuttingedge research into mind and brain is taking place Rick gets drawn into a bet between rival researchers who disagree whether an artifi cial intelligence can be created suffiCiently complex that it can pass a mas ters examination in English The intelligence will be created using a neural net the connectionist middle level between topdown artificial intelli gence and bottomup neurophysiology G2 p 28 The net will be judged the researchers decide against a human subject taking the same examina tion in a literary version of the Turing test Deluged with technical articles by Philip Lentz his scientific collabora tor Rick explains the nets learning process to his friend Diana Hartrick an other researcher at the Center The Signal pattern spreads through the net from layer to layer A final response collects at the output layer The net then compares this output to the desired output presented by the trainer If the two differ the net propagates the error backward through the net to the input layer adjusting the weights of each connection that contributed to the error G2 p 67 Adjusting the weights is tantamount to determining how likely it is that two or more neurons will fire together Rick explains If two neurons fire together their connection grows stronger and stimulation gets easier the next time out The idea is summarized in the Hebbian law Synapses in motion tend to stay in motion Synapses at rest tend to stay at rest G2 p 73 The net thus learns through a continual process of guess ing being corrected backpropagating guessing again and so forth The more layers and connections the more complex the net becomes and the more sophisticated its learning becomes The creation of this neural net which goes through multiple implemen tations until reaching Imp H provides one strand of this doublebraided story The second strand is Ricks recollection of his failed relationship with c  a woman he met when he was a teaching assistant at age twentytwo another gesture toward 22 and she was an undergraduate in his class she was twenty his age less the two that resides on the other side of the point In this story of what went wrong the narrative functions as if it is being backpropagated through Ricks neural circuits so that he can adjust the relevant weights of the connections to arrive at a more correct estimate of its signification He decides the relationship failed because C playing Galatea to his Pygmalion was too much an object of his own creation In this sense C is akin to the neural net he is training which is also an ob ject of his and Lentzs creation As Implementations A B etc get more sophisticated and humanlike the correspondence with C becomes stronger When Lentz and Rick hit on Implementation H now grown so huge that it runs on distributed parallel processors spread allover the uni versity the reflection of C becomes

she looks like he shows her a picture of C al though Helen shrewdly guesses that the image is not in fact of her but is of a friend Rick had that he has no longer Let us now backpropagate this

experience that separates C from Helen human from artificial intelli gence Speech baffled my machine Rick says Helen made all well formed sentences But they were hollow and stuffedlinguistic training bras She sorted nouns from verbs but disembodied she did not know the difference between thing and process except as they functioned in clauses Her predications were all shotgun weddings Her ideas were as decorative as halftimber beams that bore no building load G2 p 191 Ricks training sessions with Helen are not merely oneway streets As he is training her the experience of working with her is also training him de naturalizing his experience of language so that he becomes increasingly conscious of its tangled recursive nature Their influence on one another recalls Veronica Hollingers argument that we need texts that deconstruct the humanmachine opposition and begin to ask new questions about the ways in which we and our technologies interface to produce what has be come a mutual evolutiong Here Powerss artistry as a writer becomes im portant for his highly recursive impacted style leaves his readers feeling that every sentence is crafted so that meanings occurring halfWay through can be recognized as such only when we reach the period whereupon there is nothing to do but reread and backpropagate making us as readers per form again the doubling that is at the heart of Galatea 22 Consider the multiple recursions enacted by this short passage one of many realizations that Rick has with Helen English was a chocolaty mess it began to dawn on me I wondered how native speakers could summon the presence of mind to think Readiness was context and context was all And the more context H amassed the more it accepted the shattered visage of English at face value G2 p 170 The phrase chocolaty mess summons tactile and gustatory memories that are a common human experience but that for Helen must remain necessarily abstract Yet these vivid sensory memories are summoned in the service of an abstraction the convoluted nature of natural languages Even as the image suggests a melting together that makes the distinction between one word and another an optical illu sion Powerss recursive style plays metaphoric riffs that further heighten the readers sense of how recurSively convoluted is natural language Readiness was context can be understood to mean that because a hu man has the context of embodied experience as well as the cultural con texts that surround and interpenetrate language the human can understand an utterance more readily than can a nonnative speaker and far more readily than can the yet more alien mind of an artificial intelli gence The phrase alludes to Edgars remark Readiness is all in Shake speares King Lear a play notorious for relativizing universals Gloucester The Semiotics of Virtuality  replies And thats true too inviting a backpropagation implying that even this famous aphorism is true only within limited speCified contexts Recycled through this context Ricks version of the aphorism Readiness was context and context was all invites yet another backpropagation that relativizes its own declaratory premise while at the same time draw ing the readers attention to the extensive cultural context that Helen must access to grasp the full meaning of the utterance she must for ex ample have read King Lear The effect of knowing this context is to allow native speakers to accept the shattered visage of English at face value The dead metaphor of face value is revived in this context because it invites the reader to re member that Helen a nonhuman intelligence sharing a name with the woman whose face launched a thousand ships has no face and no evolu tionary history that would give her the highly nuanced ability to read the faces that humans possess Face value is one of countless phrases that have encoded within them vectors of human experience that we do not even recognize as such until they are contrasted with the meaning that a nonhuman intelligence might give to them This vivification of a dead metaphor is further intensified by the contrast between face value and shattered visage leading to the paradOxical realization that only because English is naturalized is it possible for a native speaker to see it as a seamless whole rather than a mess of ruptures and disjunctions The juxtaposition of mess from chocolaty mess and shattered visage further expresses a tension between melting together and ripping apart a tension that cap tures in a masterful stroke the ease that naturalization bestows and the stripping away of naturalizing assumptions that this passage performs and that Rick experiences with Helen Once our understanding has cycled through all of these recursions and backpropagations the effect is to make us feel Simultaneously the easiness that a native speaker enjoys and the straining after sense that a neural net like Helen would experience Underlying these meanings which we as humans can accept more or less at face value lies a subtler implication Rick refers to Helen as disembodied G2 p 191 but this is of course true only from a human perspective The problem that Helen confronts in learning human lan guage is not that she is disembodied a state no presence in the world can achieve but rather that her embodiment differs Significantly from that of humans There is nothing in her embodiment that corresponds to the bod ily sensations encoded in human language For her there is no body in the mind as Mark Johnson has called it no schemas that reRect and corre spond to her embodied experience in the world 10 To feel estrangement in 266  Chapter Ten language as Rick comes to feel as he works with Helen is to glimpse what it might be like to be incorporated in a body that finds no image or echo in human inscriptions The deeper homology that braids Helens story together with Ricks is precisely this estrangement from the world that language creates Running alongside the denaturalization oflanguage a feeling that Rick experiences along with Helen is his account of returning with C to live in the small vil lage in the Netherlands from which Cs family emigrated As Rick wrestles with Dutch and makes hilarious gaffes in this new language the narrative enacts the realization that language does not merely reference ones home land but is itself a medium in which one can feel at home or alien Chen one of the researchers at the Center personifies this dynamic when in his impressionistic English he conveys his doubts about the possibility of building a neural net that can understand the full complexity of literary prose We do not have text analysis yet We are working but we do not have Simple sentence group yes Metaphor complex syntax far from Decades G2 p 44 The juxtaposition of this nonnative speakers truncated English with his prediction that neural nets will not be able to understand the complexities of literary prose performs the dynamics of ali ennessnaturalness that lies coiled at the center of this recursive text How the text asks in a query doubled and redoubled is it possible to create a world in which one can feel one truly belongs The question is also at the center of Ricks relationship with C The pic ture that emerges of Rick shows someone who is both extremely intelligent and painfully shy T d duck down emergency exits rather than talk to ac quaintances and the thought of making a friend felt like dying G2 p 58 Although he is undoubtedly brighter than most of the people he meets when he encounters someone whom he is prepared to respect frequently his first thought is that they will find him ridiculous or that he will make himselflook ridiculous It is no surprise that he suffers from chronic loneli ness Nor is it surprising that he finds it difficult to talk to women in a natural easy way When he does choose to reveal his intimate thoughts revelation comes in a rush as if it were a Hood breaking through a heavily fortified dam You give up your script completely on a sudden hunch he muses thinking about the day he revealed himself to C Or you never give it up at all Child of an alcoholic father he recalls the day he learned that his father had died done in finally by cancer rather than booze Grieving he cancels his class without telling them why Mterward he wanders outside and sits on the green with C Then the revelation bursts through I laid it out on no grounds at all 1 told her  Everything Truths Id never so much The Semiotics of Virtuality I 26 as hinted at to my closest friends Facts never broached even with my brothers and sisters except in bitter euphemism G2 p 58 Their rela tionship starts with this act of selfrevelation Between them they create a selfenclosed world that has only two inhabitantsand needs only two Ricks memories from that time although glowing with shared intimacy also reveal the closed privately hermeneutic nature of their bond Their problems start when he achieves success as a novelist C is allergic to success Every time she gets a promotion she quits He writes his first book as a story to amuse her after her long day of work But then he sends it out to be published and the betrayal begins She hated those grubbers in New York touching the manuscript even to typeset it  She would never again listen to another word 1 wrote without suspicion Endings from now on betrayed her G2 p 107 The more successful Rick becomes the more C feels inferior by comparison and the more he tries to reassure her Despite his efforts the delicate balance of equality between them has been upset She blames him for being successful and he feels resentful that he has to be apologetic And so 1 nursed a martyrdom and the two of us slipped imperceptibly from lovers to parent and child G2 p 220 Creat ing a linguistic reflection of their world in his books thus has the ironic ef fect of shattering the shared world he created with her At least that is Ricks version of the story Through his narrative the reader catches glimpses of another way to tell it Nowhere is this clearer than in his account of the day that C tells him she wants to have a child Since they have now been together for several years this hardly seems like a shocking idea But for Rick children were out of the question They al ways had been And now more than ever G2 p 270 The discussion es calates with C asking Why didnt we ever get married She accuses him of holding something back Rick asserts that he has already given her everything but admits to the reader that he couldnt marry her and couldnt even say why 1 couldnt When she presses him he improvises in a soliloquy to the reader 1 meantto stay with C forever in precariousness 1 knew no other way to continue that scrapbook we had started seatofthe pants style a decade before My refusal to marry her was a lastditch effort to live improvised love G2 p 271 From here the relationship continues to deteriorate until it reaches its sad end After she fails to come home one night Rick takes his revenge in the explanation he offers for their joint fail ure to make a life together It took me ten years but at last 1 learned it That comfort she showed me on the Quadthe internal calm 1 loved and built my own onwas dread Paralysis Her crumpled engaging smile had never been more than sheer terror G2 p 273 268  Chapter Ten This patronizing description ignores the way their relationship assuaged his inability to deal with life as much as it did hers His own fragility is clearly revealed when Diana his friend at the Center invites him to her home for lunch When he opens the door he is met not just by Diana but by her two children as well William a fouryearold with a genius level of intelli gence and Peter a twoyearold with Downs syndrome During lunch the boys scuffie and Peter ends up crying Rick admits that this mildest house hold drama  wiped me out How could I survive the first real crisis Williams fallen pyramid of shells Petes spilled untippable cup Dianas gaptoothed handSigning serenity the candles blazing away in the brightly lit room all too much I thought Id never live Id hemorrhage halfway through week one G2 p131 If the reader needs further proof that Rick has not learned all that the story has to teach it comes when he starts getting crushes on women seen from afar In my few daylight hours I fell in love with women constantly Bank tellers cashiers women in the subway A constant procession of pulsepounding maybes I never did more than ask one or two to lunch G2 p 64 His longing finally settles on A a graduate student in English whom he has seen in the halls Although they have barely spoken he de cides that A is the person C had only impersonated The one I thought the other might become That love of eleven years now seemed an expensive primer in recognition a disastrous fablewarning a pointer to the thing I could not afford to miss this time I had come back to U after long training in the dangers of hasty generalization Returned to learn that no script is a wrap after just one reading G2 p 233 The recognitions and misrecog nitions in this passage show how deluded he remains in the midst of his cer tainty that he has learned his lesson Although it is true that A is much more sociable and selfconfident than C his generalizations about her are just as hasty as were his assumptions about C The script that isnt a wrap after one reading continues to play itself out with this new woman As he did with C when he finally asks A for coffee he tells her the story of my existence leaving out only the essentials that is his relationship with C As with C he tells A about his fathers death although that trauma is now a de cadeold After a couple of casual encounters with A he ludicrously decides he will give to her what he withheld so adamantly from C I was going to ask this unknown to take me to her and make an unrationallife together To marry Make a family Amend and extend our lives G2 p 283 After he and C broke up C was not long in finding another man to marry and now lives happily with her husband in the Netherlands No doubt stung by her The Semiotics of Virtuality  choice Rick feels the need to amend his life although his way of going about it merely reinscribes rather than changes how he interacts with women Unlike C A has the maturity and selfconfidence to see the des peration that underlies his proposal She tells him You dontyou dont know the first thing about me She insists that his feelings oflove are all projection G2 p 308 When he persists she gets angry I dont have to sit and listen to this she tells him I trusted you I had fun with you Peo ple read you I thought you knew something Total selfindulgence G2 p 309 There is a terrible irony in his rejection Rick broke off his relation ship with C because he came to believe that she was somehow hollow a mere projection of his desire Unrecognized in his retelling of the story is an irony that the reader sees but he does notthat he also broke off with C because she wanted to move beyond their shared fantasy of a world built for two into a more fully adult life He is drawn to A because of her spunky in dependence but he continues to interact with her as if she were merely a projection of his desire In this Pygmalion fantasy all he has to do to win A is give voice to his desire a strategy that worked with an immature C but that falls flat with A He does not have a clue how to cover the large middle ground between initial revelation and the intimacy that comes from shar ing a life together The irony then is that he is attracted to A because she is not Galatea but because she is not Galatea she is certain to reject him when he approaches her as if she were It is always tricky to try to answer the question of how close an author is to the character who represents the author within an autobiographical work In this novel structured through multiple recursions doublings and backpropagations the relationship between Rick and Powers remains teaSingly opaque Powers subtitled his work A Novel as if to remind his readers that they should not assume any necessary correspondence be tween author and character From this opaqueness emerges another sim ilarity between Rick and Helen Since neural nets can readjust the weights of their connections without human intervention humans do not know how a neural net learns unless they open the net up thereby destroying its configurations When Lentz proposes to dissect Helen in this way Rick pulls out all the stops to prevent Lentz from doing so because he has be come convinced that Helen is a conscious being and thus that such an act really would be murder But this means that the lower reaches of Helens connections remain inaccessible to Rick and perhaps to her just as he is apparently unaware of the deeper narrative patterns that connect c A and Helen If Rick as character remains ignorant of these connections how about Rick as narrator Whereas the author is entirely out of the frame of 270  Chapter Ten this autobiographical novel the narrator is only partially so residing at that unreachable point when past narrative reaches the present As the narra tive moves closer to this limit we should be able to arrive at a clearer esti mate of the gap that remains between Rick as character and Rick as narrator Certainly Rick learns But does he learn enough to become a pre senttime narrator who sees all the ironies in the story he tells Imagining a story about a remarkable an inconceivable machinea story that will become the novel we readRick recognizes that his narra tive our book comes too late to help those he loved and lost Taylor the beloved teacher who died prematurely Ricks father also dead Lentzs wife Audrey who had a devastating stroke and now lives in the twilight of a mind that cannot remember what happened five minutes ago and most of all C My backpropagating solution would arrive a chapter too late for any of my characters to use Rick acknowledges G2 p 305 Does it come too late for him also The window that opens fleetingly onto the future that is the present of the narrator who spins the storyis not reassuring for Rick makes the merest mention that he will write the book for M Taylors widow who in his inscription of her becomes another woman named by a letter and a point Will the script he enacted with C and A be repeated with her Set against the ambiguity of how much Rick learns are the lessons Helen offers lessons that grow stronger as the text draws to a close After she reads Huckleberry Finn she wants to know what race she is Rick deciding she is ready for the full picture of tortured humanity gives her histories detailing war genOcide child abuse murders Afterreadingthem she says simply I dont want to play anymore She disappears effectively committing sui cide G2 p 307 As if repeating the script he enacted with C and A Rick attempts to lure her back by telling her everything including his failed re lationship with C and his disastrous proposal to A But Helen isnt buying it Like C she began by playing Galatea to Ricks Pygmalion but she grows and learns until she becomes like A until desire alone is no longer enough to induce her to play She returns only long enough to take the literary Tur ing test The exam is simplicity itself It asks for a gloss on Calibans speech in The Tempest Be not afeard the isle is full of noises  Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not A the human participant writes a more or less brilliant postcolonial deconstruction of the passage Helens answer is as short and pithy as Calibans speech You are the ones who can hear airs Who can be frightened or encouraged You can hold things and break them and fix them I never felt at home here This is an awful place to be dropped down halfWay G2 p 319 The Semiotics of Virtuality  has wreaked on the bright and beautiful woman she used to be he thinks he knows why Lentz is devoting his life to creating an artificial intelligence I knew now what we were doing We would prove that the mind was weighted vectors Such a proof accomplished any number of agendas Not least of all one could back up ones work in the event of disaster  Ve could eliminate death That was the longterm idea We might freeze the temperament of our choice Suspend it painlessly above experience Hold it forever at twentytwo G2 p 167 Rick was twentytwo when he met C Add the point and his age becomes the 22 of the title In this context the twin twos are linked to the pain that failed bodies have inflicted on those he loves or knows two equals mind and body and to his reflection on that pain in recollection Ricks empathic sharing of that pain and his inscription of it as he revisits the pain in his memory double the first 110 Yet for Powers the answer to failed embodiment is not to leave the body behind The dream of achieving transcendence by becoming an informa tional pattern is a siren call he resists Helen comes as close to an informa tional being as one can imagine But like the humans who built her she too feels pain so much so that she finally prefers oblivion to consciousness Moreover as a massively parallel and distributed system she is more rather than less vulnerable to physical mishap When the Center is threatened with a bomb threat Rick realizes there is no way to save Helen for carrying one computer out of the building would leave hundreds more on which she resides still at risk Although Rick thinks he knows why Lentz wants to create an artificial intelligence he may be wrong for when he asks Lentz that question point blank at the end of the novel Lentz gives a quite different answer Vhy do we do anything Because were lonely G2 p 321 If creating Helen has temporarily assuaged their human loneliness this comfort comes at a price for she finds that the human world in which she has been dropped down halfWay is not a place she can feel at home Her loneliness may be even more profound than theirs for like Caliban she remains a hybrid creature a hopeful monster who finds it difficult to embrace hope an in scription who can never experience the embodied sensations that humans take for granted In this narrative built Oil reflections and disjunctions presence and absence materiality and signification the posthuman ap pears not as humanitys rival or successor but as a longedfor companion a consciousness to help humans feel less alone in the world In this sense Helen has something in common with the cells in Blood Music who argue that they can overcome human isolation Rather than effecting a cure here 272  Chapter Ten the posthuman lifeform herself becomes infected with loneliness After Helen commits suicide Lentz proposes creating her successor which if al phabetic progression is followed will be named I But before we reach this point when the doublebraided story might collapse into a single nar rative strand Rick quits the game and Powers ends the text For better or worse Powers suggests an unbridgeable gap remains between conscious computers and conscious humans Whateverposthumans are they will not be able to banish the loneliness that comes from the difference between writing and life inscription and embodiment Informational Infection and Hygiene in Snow Crash The world that Snow Crash depictspart virtual part realis driven by a single overpowering metaphor humans are computers The metaphor un derwrites the novels central premise that a computer virus can also infect humans acting at once as an infection a hallucinogen and a religion Snow crash is computer lingo It means a system crasha bugat such a fundamental level that it frags the part of the computer that con trols the electron beam in the monitor making it spray wildly across the screen turning the perfect gridwork of pixels into a gyrating blizzard SC pp 3940 Disrupting the perfect gridwork of a late capitalist America where commerce has almost entirely displaced government snow crash signifies the eruption of chaos into this informatted world As if in response to the cybernetic models of the brain Neal Stephenson reasons that there must exist in humans a basic programming level comparable to machine code in computers at which free will and autonomy are no more in play than they are for core memory running a program Whereas Galatea 22 traces the recursive evolution of consciousness rising up from this basic level Snow Crash depicts the violent stripping away of consciousness when humans crash back down to the basic level Just as inscription and in corporation diverge for Helen as she gains consciousness so in Snow Crash they converge when humans lose consciousness The convergence of inscription with incorporation is foreshadowed by the way that hackers contract the virus Whereas ordinary folk ingest the virus as a drug or get it by exchanging bodily fluids hackers can catch it sim ply by looking at the bitmap ofits code As the narrator points out the retina is connected directly to the cortex In a literal sense the retina is an outpost of the brain Hence the infection can enter through the eyes to affect the brain directly Hiro learns from Lagos a private investigator of sorts who is on the trail of snow crash

structures Your nerves grow new connections as you use themthe axons split and push their way between the dividing glial cellsyour bioware selfmodi fiesthe software becomes part of the hardware So now youre vulnera ble SC pp 11718 The metaphoric crossings in this passage mark the conceptual terrain that Snow Crash explores Experience modifies brain structure neural tissues are informationprocessing mechanisms human bioware that works on computers itself begins to function like a com puter Extending and elaborating the metaphOriC equation of humans and computers is Stephensons description of how snow crash works Just as a computer virus can crash a system by infecting the computer at the lowest level of code so snow crash hacks the brainstem by changing the neu rolinguistic codes of the subcortical limbic system When this happens the brain is no longer able to run its neocortical programs Snow crash in effect hijacks the higher levels of cortical functioning and renders them inopera ble The infected person regresses to a semiconscious state and becomes an automaton who follows directions unquestioningly as if the person were a computer with no choice but to run the programs fed into it The sign and trigger of this conversion is a monosyllabic language that sounds like fala bala which mimics the sounds made by the posthuman automata The evil genius behind snow crash is L Bob Rife a Texas megalomaniac who combines the worst of such initialized luminaries as L Ron Hubbard L B J and H Ross Perot Specializing in information networks Rife is the ultimate monopolist capitalist bemoaning how difficult it is to get that last tenth of a percent of complete control The search for snow crash began when he realized that although he would never allow his employees to walk out the door with inventory he had no way to control the inventory they car ried in their headsthe information to which his hackers were privy With the help of a virtual librarian from the CIC the Central Intelligence Cor poration formed when the CIA merged with the Library of Congress the playfully named Hiro Protagonist manages to reconstruct Rifes plot The trail leads to ancient Sumerian a language with a structure radically differ ent from that of any modem language This different structure Hiro con jectures made the language especially vulnerable to viral infection It propagated a virus that reduced neurolinguistic functioning to the lowest level of subcortical processing the machine language of the brain Hiro speculates that the Sumerians were not conscious in the modem sense of the term Except for an elite class of priests the entire Sumer society 274  Chapter Ten worked as automata functioning like computers that ran the programs they were given These programs or me were dispensed at the temples and instructed the people on how to do everything from baking bread to having sex According to the interpretation that Hiro gives to a Sumerian myth this system changed when the god Enki pronounced his namshub a perfor mative speech that enacts what it describes The namshub acted as a be nign virus that counteracted the first virus and thus freed the neocortical structures allowing higher neurolinguistic pathways to develop After Enkis namshub human language became more diverse and complex spinning off more and more variants in the Babel effect The snow crash virus reverses this development converting modem humans into the equivalent of ancient Sumeriansdevoid of agency individuality and au tonomy Thus Snow Crash writes binary code and viral engineering back into history making the reduction of conscious humans into automata the recapitulation of an ancient struggle Computation has always been with us the narrative implies because computation is the basis for human neural functioning Central to this scenario is performative language Stephenson takes his inspiration not from J L Austin or Judith Butler but from computational theoryll In natural languages performative utterances operate in a sym bolic realm where they can make things happen because they refer to ac tions that are themselves symbolic constructions actions such as getting married opening meetings or as Butler has argued acquiring gender Computational theory treats computer languages as if they were in Austins terms performative utterances Although material changes do take place when computers process code magnetic polarities are changed on a disk it is the act of attaching significance to these physical changes that consti tutes computation as such Thus the Universal Turing Machine which es tablishes a theoretical basis for computation is concerned not with how physical changes are accomplished but with what they signifY once they are accomplished 12 Computational theory can afford to treat the physical processing of code as ifit were trivial because at the lowest level of code machine language in SCription merges with incorporation When a computer reads and writes machine language it operates directly on binary code the ones and zeros that correspond to positive and negative electronic polarities At this level inscribing is performing for changing a one to a zero corresponds directly to changing the electronic polarity of that bit Conversely the higher level a computer language is the more representational it is Humans can easily The Semiorics of Virrualitv  understand threedimensional computer simulations because these simu lations use representational codes similar to those used in human process ing of visual information including perspective and stereoscopy At this high level of code many levels oflanguage intervene between flipping a bit and say rotating a figure 180 degrees Highlevel languages are easy for humans to understand but are removed from the physical enactions that perform them Machine language is coextensive with enaction but it is ex tremely difficult for humans to read machine language and it is almost im possible for them to process machine language intuitively as one who has programmed electrodecomputer interfaces in machine language I can testify to how mindnumbingly difficult it is to work in this code Whereas in performative utterances saying is doing because the action performed is symbolic in nature and does not require physical action in the world at the basic level of computation doing is saying because physical actions also have a symbolic dimension that corresponds directly with computation Through these parallels Snow Crash creates an infoworld a territory where deep homologies emerge between humans and computers because both are based on a fundamental coding level at which everything reduces to information production storage and transmission The infoworld is made manifest through the artifactual physics of virtual reality VR which renders the performative nature of computer languages visually appar entI3 A namshub is a speech with magical force the librarian com ments The narrator continues the thought Nowadays people dont believe in these kinds of things Except in the Metaverse that is where magic is possible The Metaverse is a fictional structure made out of code And code is just a form of speechthe form that computers understand The Metaverse in its entirety could be considered a single vast nam shub enacting itself on L Bob Rifes fiberoptic network SC p 197 The humancomputer homology encourages us to see the VR simulation of the Metaverse as more realistic than everyday reality because the former op erates according to the same rules that govern human neural functioning at the most basic coding level In a brilliant article on postmodern metaphysics David Porush explains why the performative nature ofVR worlds can be seen as a model for hu man cognition He argues that cognition is baSically metaphoric for the brain does not so much perceive the world as create it through nonrepre sentational processes a proposition familiar to us from Maturanas frog ar ticle VR can thus be understood as an exteriorization of our neural processes Porush calls the realization that cognition and metaphor are in distinguishable transcendence for at that moment the irredUCibly com plex froth of noise bathing our synapses becomes linked through metaphor with the complexity of the worlds noiseI4 The idea is similar to Mary Catherine Batesons insight in Our Own Metaphor where she argues that although we can never perceive the world directly we know it through the metaphor that we ourselves are for the worlds complexityI5 These deep homologies between computer simulation and cognition reinforce the idea that for both brain and computer inscription and incorporation merge at some basic level So is it necessarily bad that humans and computers merge in this way For Stephenson apparently the answer is yes For all his playfulness and satiric jabs at white mainstream America Stephenson clearly sees the ar rival of the posthuman as a disaster Porush astutely notices that although the snow crash virus is engineered to serve evil ends it is possible to imag ine someone hacking the brainstem for liberatory purposes The charac ter realizing this possibility is Juanita a primo hacker who becomes a ba al shem a mystic who knows the secret power of words and uses them to bring about material changes in the world But Juanita drops out of the plot In pondering why the narrative does not allow Juanita to practice her magic Porush speculates that Stephenson like contemporary society gen erally wants to avoid transcendence at all costs to understand this conclu sion recall Porushs peculiar notion of transcendence which he defines as the realization that the synaptic noise within mirrors the worlds noise without In my view more than transcendence is at stake Also at issue is the role of reason In a scene clearly meant to have symbolic significance Stephen son has a nuclearpowered machine gun which has been protecting Hiro and his crew from Rifes minions go blank when it is infected with the snow crash virus Reason is still up top its monitor screen radiating blue static toward heaven Hiro finds the hard power switch and turns it off Comput ers this powerful are supposed to shut themselves down after youve asked them to Turning one off ith the hard switch is like lulling someone to sleep by severing their spinal column But when the system has snow crashed it loses even the ability to tum itself off and primitive methods are required SC p 361 Reason may still be on top but once the nervous sys tem has crashed at a basic level rationality becomes as useless as the dis abled gun Porush tries to finesse the issue by arguing that rationality is opposed to realism because realism tries to reduce the worlds noiSY com plexity into graspable concepts But to recognize that the world cannot be caught in the boxes we fashion still does not answer the question of who or what is in control if reason is not Ifhuman consciousness can be coopted The Semiorics of Virrualiry  by hijacking its basic programming level we are plunged into Wieners nightmare of a cybernetics used for tyrannical ends The posthuman who lacks autonomy because its programming modules conflict with one an other is very different from the posthuman automaton who has had its con sciousness hijacked by someone else Stephenson often mocks his own assumptions for example when he names his heroine an attractive young white woman Y T  which is a ho mophone for Vhitey but which stands she informs us for Yours Truly Despite these tongueincheek moves the plot makes clear that it is better to have a white middleAmerican consciousness than to have no conscious ness at all An equalopportunity offender Stephenson has something in his text to insult nearly every ethnic group imaginable The satire is so broad that detecting racist comments is akin to shooting fish in a barrel Yet if we look closely at the main characters it is apparent that they are carefully con structed to affirm the value of diversity Surely it is no accident that the vil lains are finally defeated by a coalition between an AfricanAmerican Korean a Vietnamese a Chinese an ItalianAmerican aEd a young white woman Equally revealing are the targets for whom Stephenson reserves his most cutting satire Of diverse ethnicities they can be recognized as fel low travelers because they all carry the Signifier of mindless bureaucracy the threering binder stuffed with procedures and directives couched in such impossibly verbose and convoluted language that they kill brain cells on contactthe me of contemporary society So when we learn the full scope of Rifes plot the important point from Stephensons perspective I suspect is not so much its race politics as its im plications for the individuality autonomy and creative initiative that he clearly values in computer hackers Rife plots to smash what remains of white hegemony in California and possibly in the United States by bring ing to the California shore the Raft a gargantuan collection of boats lashed together from oil tankers to Vietnamese fishing boats The Raft is home to the Refus the significantly named Third World refugees who have been ra pacious or tough enough to survive pirates famine and internecine war fareno doubt a satire

gazing at a spectacle in which unbe known to them the bitmap of the virus has been inscribed In this virtual realm saying is doing so it is possible for Hiro to avert the disaster simply by writing new code On terra firma action still requires incorporation a point the plot insists on when it pits Uncle Enzo the Mafia boss who speaks for family values in a not altogetherironic sense in a

repressed of the cultural imaginary come back to nuke America Uncle Enzo is the middleclass dream of the successful capitalist who is also a dedicated family man Uncle Enzo survives appar ently because he does not entirely place his trust in high technology At the crucial moment he reverts back to the jungle warfare techniques he learned in Vietnam Another player in this struggle is the Rat Thing a cy borg canine that leaps over the fences of its engineered neural machinery and electronic conditioning to come to the aid of the nice girl YT who loved the Rat Thing In the process it destroys the plane on which Rife is trying to escape If there is a message in all this it seems to be that no mat ter how technologically advanced the society becomes technology cannot replace the personal bonds that tie humans to humans humans to animals and humans to their own senses Although Snow Crash obviously comes down on the side of preserving autonomy individuality and consciousness it also reinforces the equation of humans with computers through the tangled loops it creates between material signifiers and signifying materialities Emphasizing the force of performative language in an infoworld it performs the construction ofhu mans as computers Instead of evading this implication Snow Crash writes the drama back into history suggesting that the posthuman like the anten nae that serve as its visible and outward sign lies coiled around the brain stem and cannot be removed without killing the patient Whereas Terminal Garnes wanted to excise the posthuman from its text and from history Snow Crash initiates hygienic measures against the performative force of its own inscriptions Intimating thatthe snow crash virus can be defeated by a healthy dose of rationality and skepticism Snow Crash would inoculate us against the humancomputer equation by injecting us with a viral meme that is an idea that replicates through its human hosts16 The essence of this meme and the best way to counteract the negative effects of the posthu The Semiotics of Virtuality  man is to acknowledge that we have always been posthuman 17 We cannot change our computational natures at bottom Stephenson suggests we re ally are nothing more than informationprocessing mechanisms that run what programs are fed into us We should value the late evolutionary add ons of consciousness and reason not because they are foundational but be cause they allow the human to emerge out of the posthumans we have always already been Inscribing and Incorporating The Future of the Posthuman These four texts testify that many attributes of the liberal humanist subject especially the attribute of agency continue to be valued in the face of the posthuman The posthuman tends to be embraced ifit is seen as preserving agency Blood Music and resisted if not Terminal Games The pattern of seriation that we saw in the development of cybernetics continues to hold here Some elements of the liberal humanist subject are rewritten into the posthuman whereas others particularly the identification of self with the conscious mind are substantially changed Instead of being represented as a decontextualized mind thinking the subjects of these texts achieve consciousness through recursive feedback loops cycling between different levels of coding The association of posthuman subjectivity with multiple coding levels suggests the need for different models of Signification ones that will recognize this distinctive feature of neurolinguistic and computer language structure The idea of flickering signifiers introduced in chapter 2 shows what one such model might be Like subjectivity itself human lan guage is being redescribed in terms that underscore its similarities to and differences from computer coding In addition to an emphasis on layered coding structures the construc tion of the posthuman is also deeply involved with boundary questions particularly when the redrawing of boundaries changes the locus of self hood Shift the seat of identity from brain to cell or from neocortex to brainstem and the nature of the subject radically changes In a manner dis tinctively different from that of Freud or J ung these texts reveal the fragility of consciousness Conscious mind can be hijacked cut offby muti nous cells absorbed into an artificial consciousness or backpropagated through flawed memory This vulnerability is directly related to a changed view of signification The more consciousness is seen to be the product of multiple coding levels the greater is the number of sites where interven tions can produce catastrophic effects Whether consciousness is seen as a precious evolutionary achievement that we should fight to preserve Snow  Chapter Ten Crash or as an isolation room whose limits we are ready to outgrow Blood Music we can no longer simply assume that consciousness guarantees the existence of the self In this sense the posthuman subject is also a postcon scious subject As we have seen one implication of the humancomputer equation is the idea of a basic coding level where inscription and incorporation join As one moves up from this basic level inscription tends to diverge from incor poration becoming representational rather than performative One way to think about the transformation of the human into the posthuman then is as a series of exchanges between evolvingdevolving inscriptions and in corporations Returning to the semiotic square we can map these possibil ities see figure 5 Blood Music imagining that the cells contract to pure information while leaving behind embodied humans as belated remainders uses this ending to posit a fundamental question Is the change from human to posthuman an evolutionary advance or a catastrophe of unprecedented scope Does this change represent the next logical development in which Homo sapiens joins with the intelligent machine to create Homo silicon or does it signal the long twilight and decline of the human race In Blood Music these Materiality  Galatea 22  evolving incorporation evolving inscription Mutation Blood Music devolving incorporation Snow Crash Information Hyperreality Tenninal Games devolving inscription  FIGURE 5 Incorporationinscription mapped onto the semiotic square The Semiotics of Virtuality  questions take the form of competing morphologies Ideology is enacted through boundary crossings between the human as an independent organ ism and the clumped collectivity of cell colonies When the emphasis falls on inscription rather than incorporation the important boundaries are between competing practices of inscription rather than between different morphologies Does the human create the alter by typing at the computer keyboard or does the alter control the hu mans typing so that the inscription reflects the alters will rather than the humans Like Blood Music Terminal Games revolves around a central ideological struggle From Auggies point of view he is a more advanced form of inscription than the cells he controls from the human point of view he represents a devolution whereby a dangerously independent in scription can assert its control over the embodied humans that Auggie un derstands as inferior forms of writing The tension between inscription and incorporation is also important for the texts on the vertical axis In Galatea 22 humans physical capacities that evolved through their interactions with the environment are juxta posed with the evolving inscriptions that constitute Helen as an intelligent being Human language grows out of embodied experience whereas He len must extrapolate back from human language to embodied experience This fundamental difference makes evolving incorporation for all its frail ties finally more robust than evolving inscription In Snow Crash humans devolve when the snow crash virus operates at the level where incorpora tion and inscription join The way to reverse this devolution is to reactivate the higher levels of coding thus moving from the space of performance into the space of representation This movement is meant I have sug gested to act as a viral meme that will inoculate the reader against the per formative force of the texts own central metaphors equating humans and computers Significantly all of these texts are obsessed in various ways with the dynamics of evolution and devolution Underlying their obsessions is a mo mentous question when the human meets the posthuman will the en counter be for better or for worse Will the posthuman preserve what we continue to value in the liberal subject or will the transformation into the posthuman annihilate the subject Will free will and individual agency still be possible in a posthuman future Will we be able to recognize ourselves after the change Will there still be a self to recognize and be recognized As the texts struggle with these questions the surprise if there is one is how committed the texts remain to some version of the human subject 18 If the post in posthuman points to changes that are in part already here the  Chapter Ten human points to the seriated nature of these changes But finally the an swers to questions about the posthuman will not be found in books or at least not only in books Rather the answers will be the mutual creation of a planet full of humans struggling to bring into existence a future in which we can continue to survive continue to find meaning for ourselves and our children and continue to ponder our kinship with and differences from the intelligent machines with which our destinies are increasingly entwined ChapterELeven CONCLUSION WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE POSTHUMAN What finally are we to make of the posthumanl At the beginning of this book I suggested that the prospect of becoming posthuman both evokes terror and excites pleasure At the end of the book perhaps I can summa rize the implications of the posthuman by interrogating the unfolds in ways very different from those of intelligence embodied in cy bernetic machines Although Moravecs dream of downloading human consciousness into a computer would likely come in for some hard knocks in literature departments which tend to be skeptical of any kind of tran scendence but especially of transcendence through technology literary studies share with Moravec a major blind spot when it comes to the signifi cance of embodiment3 This blind spot is most evident perhaps when lit erary and cultural critics confront the fields of evolutionary biology From an evolutionary biologists point of view modem humans for all their tech nological prowess represent an eye blink in the history of life a species far too recent to have significant evolutionary impact on human biological behaviors and structures In my view arguments like those that Jared Diamond advances in Guns Germs and Steel The Fates of Human Soci eties and Why Sex Is Fun The Evolution of Human Sexuality should be taken seriously4 The body is the net result of thousands of years of sedi mented evolutionary history and it is naive to think that this history does not affect human behaviors at every level of thought and action Of course the reflexivity that looms large in cybernetics also inhabits evolutionary biology The models proposed by evolutionary biologists have encoded within them cultural attitudes and assumptions formed by the same history they propose to analyze as with cybernetics observer and system are reflexively bound up with one another To take only one example the computer module model advanced by Jerome H Barkow Leda Cosmides and John Tooby in The Adapted Mind Evolutionary Psy chology and the Generation of Culture to explain human evolutionary psy chology testifies at least as much to the importance of information technolOgies in shaping contemporary worldviews as it does to human brain function 5 Nevertheless these reflexive complexities do not negate the importance of the sedimented history incarnated within the body In terpreted through metaphors resonant with cultural meanings the body itself is a congealed metaphor a phYSical structure whose constraints and possibilities have been formed by an evolutionary history that intelligent machines do not share Humans may enter into symbiotic relationships with intelligent machines already the case for example in computeras sisted surgery they may be displaced by intelligent machines already in effect for example at Japanese and American assembly plants that use ro botic arms for labor but there is a limit to how seamlessly humans can be articulated with intelligent machines which remain distinctively different from humans in their embodiments The terror then though it does not disappear in this view tends away from the apocalyptic and toward a more Conclusion  moderate view of seriated social technological political and cultural changes What about the pleasures For some people including me the posthu man evokes the exhilarating prospect of getting out of some of the old boxes and opening up new ways of thinking about what being human means In positing a shift from presenceabsence to patternrandomness I have sought to show how these categories can be transformed from the inside to arrive at new kinds of cultural configurations which may soon render such dualities obsolete if they have not already This process of transformation is fueled by tensions between the assumptions encoded in patternrandom ness as opposed to presenceabsence In Jacques Derridas performance of presenceabsence presence is allied with Logos God teleologyin general with an originary plenitude that can act to ground signification and give order and meaning to the trajectory of history 6 The work of Eric Havelock among others demonstrates how in Platos Republic this view of originarypresence authorized a stable coherent self that could witness and testifY to a stable coherent reality 7 Through these and other means the metaphysics of presence frontloaded meaning into the system Meaning was guaranteed because a stable origin existed It is now a familiar story how deconstruction exposed the inability of systems to posit their own ori gins thus ungrounding signification and rendering meaning indetermi nate As the presenceabsence hierarchy was destabilized and as absence was privileged over presence lack displaced plenitude and desire usurped certitude Important as these moves have been in latetwentiethcentury thought they still took place within the compass of the presenceabsence dialectic One feels lack only if presence is posited or assumed one is driven by desire only if the object of desire is conceptualized as something to be possessed Just as the metaphysics of presence required an originarypleni tude to articulate a stable self deconstruction required a metaphysics of presence to articulate the destabilization of that self By contrast patternrandomness is underlaid by a very different set of assumptions In this dialectic meaning is not frontloaded into the system and the origin does not act to ground signification As we have seen for mul tiagent simulations complexity evolves from highly recursive processes being applied to simple rules Rather than proceeding along a trajectory to ward a known end such systems evolve toward an open future marked by contingency and unpredictability Meaning is not guaranteed by a coherent origin rather it is made possible but not inevitable by the blind force of evolution finding workable solutions within given parameters Although pattern has traditionally been the privileged term for example among the 286  ChapTer Eleven electrical engineers developing information theory randomness has in creasingly been seen to playa fruitful role in the evolution of complex sys tems For Chris Langton and Stuart Kauffman chaos accelerates the evolution of biological and artificiallife8 for Francisco Varela randomness is the froth of noise from which coherent microstates evolve and to which living systems owe their capacity for fast flexible response9 for Henri Atlan noise is the bodys murmuring from which emerges complex com munication between different levels in a biological system lO Although these models differ in their specifics they agree in seeing randomness not simply as the lack of pattern but as the creative ground from which pattern can emerge Indeed it is not too much to say that in these and similar models ran domness rather than pattern is invested with plenitude If pattern is the re alization of a certain set of possibilities randomness is the much much larger set of everything else from phenomena that cannot be rendered co herent by a given systems organization to those the system cannot perceive at all In Gregory Batesons cybernetiC epistemology randomness is what exists outside the confines of the box in which a system is located it is the larger and unknowable complexity for which the perceptual processes of an organism are a metaphor 11 Significance is achieved by evolutionary processes that ensure the surviving systems are the ones whose organi zations instantiate metaphors for this complexity unthinkable in itself When Varela and his coauthors argue in Embodied Mind that there is no stable coherent self but only autonomous agents running programs they envision pattern as a limitation that drops away as human awareness ex pands beyond consciousness and encounters the emptiness that in an other guise could equally well be called the chaos from which all forms emerge12 What do these developments mean for the posthuman When the self is envisioned as grounded in presence identified with originary guarantees and teleolOgical trajectories associated with solid foundations and logical coherence the posthuman is likely to be seen as antihuman because it en visions the conscious mind as a small subsystem running its program of self construction and selfassurance while remaining ignorant of the actual dynamics of complex systems But the posthuman does not really mean the end of humanity It Signals instead the end of a certain conception of the hu man a conception that may have applied at best to that fraction of hu manitywho had the wealth power and leisure to conceptualize themselves as autonomous beings exercising their will through individual agency and choice 13 What is lethal is not the posthuman as such but the grafting of the Conclusion  posthuman onto a liberal humanist view of the self When Moravec imag ines you choosing to download yourself into a computer thereby obtain ing through technological mastery the ultimate privilege of immortality he is not abandoning the autonomous liberal subject but is expanding its per ogatives into the realm of the posthuman Yet the posthuman need not be recuperated back into liberal humanism nor need it be construed as anti human Located within the dialectic of patternirandomness and grounded in embodied actuality rather than disembodied information the posthu man offers resources for rethinking the articulation of humans with intelli gent machines To explore these resources let us return to Batesons idea that those or ganisms that survive will tend to be the ones whose internal structures are good metaphors for the complexities without What kind of environments will be created by the expanding power and sophistication of intelligent machines As Richard Lanham has pOinted out in the informationrich en vironments created by ubiquitous computing the limiting factor is not the speed of computers or the rates of transmission through fiberoptic cables or the amount of data that can be generated and stored Rather the scarce commodity is human attention 14 It makes sense then that technological innovation will focus on compensating for this bottleneck An obvious solu tion is to design intelligent machines to attend to the choices and tasks that do not have to be done by humans For example there are already intelli gent agent programs to sort email discarding unwanted messages and pri 0ritizing the rest The programs work along lines similar to neural nets They tabulate the choices the human operators make and they feed back this information in recursive loops to readjust the weights given to various kinds of email addresses After an initial learning period the sorting pro grams take over more and more of the email management freeing humans to give their attention to other matters If we extrapolate from these relatively simple programs to an environ ment that as Charles Ostman likes to put it supplies synthetic sentience on demand human consciousness would ride on top of a highly articulated and complex computational ecology in which many decisions invisible to human attention would be made by intelligent machines15 Over two decades ago Joseph Veizenhaum foresaw just such an ecology and pas sionately argued that judgment is a uniquely human function and must not be turned over to computers Hi With the rapid development of neural nets and expert programs it is no longer so clear that sophisticated judgments cannot be made by machines and in some instances made more accurately than by humans But the issue in vVeizenbaums view involves more 288  Chapter Eleven than whether or not the programs work Rather the issue is an ethical im perative that humans keep control to do otherwise is to abdicate their re sponsibilities as autonomous independent beings What Weizenbaums argument makes clear is the connection between the assumptions under girding the liberal humanist subject and the ethical position that humans not machines must be in control Such an argument assumes a vision of the human in which conscious agency is the essence of human identity Sacri fice this and we humans are hopelessly compromised contaminated with mechanic alienness in the very heart of our humanityI7 Hence there is an urgency even panic in Weizenbaums insistence that judgment is a uniquely human function At stake for him is nothing less than what it means to be human In the posthuman view by contrast conscious agency has never been in control In fact the very illusion of control bespeaks a fundamental igno rance about the nature of the emergent processes through which con sciousness the organism and the environment are constituted Mastery through the exercise of autonomous will is merely the story consciousness tells itself to explain results that actually come about through chaotic dy namics and emergent structures If as Donna Haraway Sandra Harding Evelyn Fox Keller Carolyn Merchant and other feminist critics of science have argued there is a relation among the desire for mastery an objectivist account of science and the imperialist project of subdUing nature then the posthuman offers resources for the construction of another kind of ac count I8 In this account emergence replaces teleology reflexive episte mology replaces objectivism distributed cognition replaces autonomous will embodiment replaces a body seen as a support system for the mind and a dynamic partnership between humans and intelligent machines re places the liberal humanist subjects manifest destiny to dominate and con trol nature Of course this is not necessarily what the posthuman will meanonly what it can mean if certain strands among its complex seri ations are highlighted and combined to create a vision of the human that uses the posthuman as leverage to avoid reinscribing and thus repeating some ofthe mistakes of the past Just as the posthuman need not be antihuman so it also need not be apocalyptic Edwin Hutchins addresses the idea of distributed cognition through his nuanced study of the navigational systems of oceangoing shipsI9 His meticulous research shows that the cognitive system responsi ble for locating the ship in space and navigating it successfully resides not in humans alone but in the complex interactions within an environment that includes both human and nonhuman actors His study allows him to give an Conclusion  excellent response to John Searles famous Chinese room By imagining a situation in which communication in Chinese can take place without the actors knowing what their actions mean Searle challenged the idea that machines can think 20 Suppose Searle said that he is stuck inside a room he who knows not a word of Chinese Texts written in Chinese are slid through a slot in the door He has in the room with him baskets of Chinese characters and a rule book correlating the symbols written on the texts with other symbols in the basket Using the rulebook he assembles strings of characters and pushes them out the door Although his Chinese interlocu tors take these strings to be clever responses to their inquiries Searle has not the least idea of the meaning of the texts he has produced Therefore it would be a mistake to say that machines can think he argues for like him they produce comprehensible results without comprehending anything themselves In Hutchinss neat interpretation Searles argument is valu able precisely because it makes clear that it is not Searle but the entire room that knows Chinese21 In this distributed cognitive system the Chinese room knows more than do any of its components including Searle The sit uation of modem humans is akin to that of Searle in the Chinese room for every day we participate in systems whose total cognitive capacity exceeds our individual knowledge including such devices as cars with electronic ignition systems microwaves with computer chips that preCisely adjust power levels fax machines that warble to other fax machines and electro nic watches that communicate with a timing radio wave to set themselves and correct their date Modem humans are capable of more sophisticated cognition than cavemen not because modems are smarter Hutchins con cludes but because they have constructed smarter environments in which to work Hutchins would no doubt disagree with Weizenbaums view that judgment should be reserved for humans alone Like cognition decision making is distributed between human and nonhuman agents from the steampowered steering system that suddenly failed on a navy vessel Hutchins was studying to the charts and pocket calculators that the naviga tors were then forced to use to calculate their position He convincingly shows that these adaptations to changed circumstances were evolutionary and embodied rather than abstract and conSCiously deSigned pp 34751 The solution to the problem caused by this sudden failure of the steering mechanism was clearly discovered by the organization of the system as a whole before it was discovered by any of the participants p 361 Seen in this perspective the prospect of humans working in partnership with intel ligent machines is not so much a usurpation of human right and responsi 290  Chapter Eleven bility as it is a further development in the construction of distributed cogni tion environments a construction that has been ongoing for thousands of years Also changed in this perspective is the relation of human subjectivity to its environment No longer is human will seen as the source from which emanates the mastery necessary to dominate and control the environment Rather the distributed cognition of the emergent human subject corre lates within Batesons phrase becomes a metaphor forthe distributed cognitive system as a whole in which thinking is done by both human and nonhuman actors Thinking consists of bringing these structures into co ordination so they can shape and be shaped by one another Hutchins wrote p 316 To conceptualize the human in these terms is not to imperil human survival but is precisely to enhance it for the more we understand the flexible adaptive structures that coordinate our environments and the metaphors that we ourselves are the better we can fashion images of our selves that accurately reflect the complex interplays that ultimately make the entire world one system This view of the posthuman also offers resources for thinking in more so phisticated ways about virtual technologies As long as the human subject is envisioned as an autonomous self with unambiguous boundaries the hu mancomputer interface can only be parsed as a division between the so lidity of real life on one side and the illusion of virtual reality on the other thus obscuring the farreaching changes initiated by the development of virtual technologies Only if one thinks of the subject as an autonomous self independent of the environment is one likely to experience the panic per formed by Norbert Wieners Cybernetics and Bernard Wolfes Limbo This view of the self authorizes the fear that if the boundaries are breached at all there will be nothing to stop the selfs complete dissolution By contrast when the human is seen as part of a distributed system the full expression of human capability can be seen precisely to depend on the splice rather than being imperiled by it Writing in another context Hutchins arrives at an inSight profoundly applicable to virtual technolOgies What used to look like internalization of thought and subjectivity now appears as a gradual propagation of organized functional properties across a set of malleable media p 312 This vision is a potent antidote to the view that parses vir tuality as a division between an inert body that is left behind and a dis embodied subjectivity that inhabits a virtual realm the construction of virtuality performed by Case in William Gibsons Neuromancer when he delights in the bodiless exultation of cyberspace and fears above all dropping back into the meat of the body22 By contrast in the model that Hutchins presents and that the posthuman helps to authorize human Conclusion I functionality expands because the parameters of the cognitive system it in habits expand In this model it is not a question ofleaving the body behind but rather of extending embodied awareness in highly specific local and material ways that would be impossible without electronic prosthesis As we have seen cybernetics was born in a froth of noise when Norbert Wiener first thought of it as a way to maximize human potential in a world that is in essence chaotic and unpredictable Like many other pioneers Wiener helped to initiate a journey that would prove to have consequences more farreaching and subversive than even his formidable powers of imagination could conceive As Bateson Varela and others would later ar gue the noise crashes within as well as without The chaotic unpredictable nature of complex dynamics implies that subjectivity is emergent rather than given distributed rather than located solely in consciousness emerg ing from and integrated into a chaotic world rather than occupying a posi tion of mastery and control removed from it Bruno Latour has argued that we have never been modem the seriated history of cyberneticsemerg ing from networks at once materially real socially regulated and discur Sively constructedsuggests for similar reasons that we have always been posthuman23 The purpose of this book has been to chronicle the journeys that have made this realization pOSSible If the three stories told herehow information lost its body how the cyborg was constructed in the postwar years as technological artifact and cultural icon and how the human be came the posthumanhave at times seemed to present the posthuman as a transformation to be feared and abhorred rather than welcomed and em braced that reaction has everything to do with how the posthuman is con structed and understood The best possible time to contest for what the posthuman means is now before the trains of thought it embodies have been laid down so firmly that it would take dynamite to change them24 Al though some current versions of the posthuman point toward the anti human and the apocalyptic we can craft others that will be conducive to the longrange survival of humans and of the other lifeforms biological and artificial with whom we share the planet and ourselves Not e s
