Critics have read these novels as commentaries on liminality trauma commodifica tion and the limits of empathy While the importance of nonhuman animals is frequently noted or analogized in these readings critics nonetheless tend to ask how these texts question the idea of the human or contest human exceptionalism I propose instead that David P Rando ostensibly human concept of hope To erode the human monopoly on hope and see our fellow creatures as full not only of life but also of hope as these novels do opens new paths of empathy between human and nonhuman animals and makes it harder to accept the continuing instrumentalization of animals under capitalism Since the nineteenth century authors have codified realist and sentimental conventions for representing animal emotions including hope1 Allegorical representations of animals have an even longer history These literary modes have had a place in the cause of notic ing respecting and helping nonhuman animals The emotional appeal of Anna Sewells sentimental novel Black Beauty 1877 for instance prompted legal reforms in Britain concerning the treatment of horses While Black Beauty had direct effects on legislation many other realist sentimental and allegorical fictions have had subtler but nonetheless substantial effects on readers hearts and minds How ever new literary innovations for representing nonhuman animals are also important because they help to overcome readers cultur ally conditioned responses both to nonhuman animals and generic conventions themselves Literary and animal studies both need new possibilities for imagining and responding to nonhuman animals Science fiction and scifi adjacent or hybrid genres represent one rich area of possibility Critics characterize scifi as an ongoing discussion Mendlesohn 1 that is unusually responsive to emerg ing scientific and technological possibilities2 David Seed Although neither novel fits comfortably within genre designations Ishiguros clones and Dicks androids draw on scifi conventions to allow readers to experience the hopes of nonhuman beings while simultaneously circumventing the culturally entrenched barriers and resistances that often limit our ability to notice and imagine the lives of nonhuman animals3 These novels cultivate the ability to imagine the experience of nonhuman hope in contexts where this hope is cruelly and unfairly dashed and these novels work to demystify hu man hope itself Ernst Bloch the primary theorist of hope claims Hope this expectant counteremotion against anxiety and fear is therefore the most human of all mental feelings and only accessible to men 75 Blochs claim that hope is the most human expectant emotion is a human exceptionalist view one that understands humans as categorically different from and superior to nonhuman animals Blochs view is also anthropocentric seeing the world from a perspective that prioritizes human over nonhuman interests Blochs The Principle of Hope written beginning in the 1930s and published in three volumes in the 1950s is a work of extraordinary scope and imagination It constitutes a virtual encyclopedia of the ways that hope manifests in art praxis and culture yet Bloch stubbornly resists anthropomor phismthe attribution of supposedly human emotions to nonhuman animalsespecially the anthropomorphism of hope More recently scholars working in the interdisciplinary field of animal studies including work in ethology anthropology psychol ogy philosophy religion literary studies and more have challenged the taboo against anthropomorphism in multiple ways Taking up Darwins work on evolutionary continuity and animal emotion scholars are now more likely to regard emotional differences between human and nonhuman animals as matters of degree rather than of kind For instance Margo DeMello writes Darwin showed that all animals including humans share a continuum of mental and emotional capacities 414 Lorraine Daston and Gregg Mitman write The advent of evolutionary theory which posits phylogenetic continuities between humans and other animals has made the ban on anthropomorphism difficult to sustain in principle as well as in practice in the life sciences 8 Scholars have also become wary of anthropodenial Are We Smart Enough 319 a term coined by etholo gist Frans de Waal to describe the categorical denial that nonhumans share attributes with humans for such denials distort our vision and inhibit our relations with nonhuman animals5 Others such as Kari Weil call for strategic or critical anthropomorphism we might then David P Rando want to call an ethical relating to animals whether in theory or in art critical anthropomorphism in the sense that we open ourselves to touch and to be touched by others as fellow subjects and may imagine their pain pleasure and need in anthropomorphic terms but stop short of believing that we can know their experience 20 These critical and ethical impulses toward anthropomorphism and away from anthropodenial suggest how fully the field of animal studies is itself animated by a sense of hope and future Indeed Paul Waldau describes one of the tasks of animal studies as exploring future possibilities 4 Yet as much as the field is premised on evolutionary continuity and animated by hope scholars avoid hope when describing non human animal cognition and emotions Those in the sciences favor more emotionally neutral language such as future planning Are We Smart Enough 229 and delayed gratification to take de Waal as example though more recently de Waal has cautiously suggested that monkeys chimpanzees dolphins wolves elephants and perhaps farmed animals may well experience hope Mamas Last Hug 1396 Mark Bekoff describes his extraordinary book The Emotional Lives of Animals as a forwardlooking book of hope that stresses that we must be imaginative in our interactions with other animals xxi yet while granting animals the capacities for love gratitude joy humor wonder embarrassment grief sadness and more Bekoff discursively reserves hope as something that humans feel and by which they are motivated From an evolutionary perspective the wariness about nonhu man hope in animal studies and the jealousy with which Bloch re serves hope for humans seems counterintuitive if hope via Bloch can be understood as profoundly seeded in human life and experi enceand the field of animal studies is only one more example of thisthen it stands to reason that human hope probably enjoys a broad evolutionary basis The ubiquity of hope that Bloch finds wo ven into virtually every human practice would suggest that it is not an emergent evolutionary trait but rather a shared inheritance with certain other nonhumans whose experience of and capacity for hope differ from ours in degree rather than in kind7 Subfields that comprise or overlap with animal studiesinclud ing humananimal studies animal rights and animal welfare studies critical animal studies ecofeminist studies animality studies and posthumanist studiesvary greatly on the position of emotions8 Cary Wolfes Derridean posthumanism is discursively high on rigor and low on emotion taking animal studies seriously thus has nothing to do strictly speaking with whether or not you like animals 567 Wolfes stance has been critiqued by ecofeminist scholars who insist on combining animal studies with emotion and care Building on Josephine Donovans 1990 critique of how Peter Singers and Tom Regans animal rights philosophies similarly disavow sentiment and emotionality Susan Fraiman critiques Wolfes resistance to and even panic 100 in the face of potentially femininizing associations such as emotion Fraiman characterizes the work of Carol J Adams Barbara Smuts and Donna Haraway as open to and ethically engaged with emotion and care even though they fall into different branches of animal studies While the posthumanist animal studies that Der rida has inspired seems crucial for any attempt to reconsider hope in relation to human and nonhuman animalsas Wolfe suggests animal studies should locate interpret and challenge not only the animals out there among the birds and beasts but in here as well at the heart of this thing we call human 572it ought to do so without dismissing affectively informed fields of socially and ethically responsive cultural studies 568 for supposedly reifying wholesale the human as knowing subject9 Rather than conforming to a single trajectory within animal studies then the study of hope in animal studies must draw across subfields and branches following the trail of emotion past critical fractures while also questioning hopes construction and apportionment within the wider constructions of humans animals and animality From a strategic perspective if hope could be habitually es tablished as a common possession between human and nonhuman animals one more thread of the tenuous basis for human discrimina tion against and exploitation of animals would be cut10 One need not subscribe to a capacitiesbased philosophical view of animal rights which argues that rights should be extended to certain animals on the basis of how closely their capacities seem to resemble ours in order to acknowledge that this approach can have pragmatic and tangible effects11 If nonhuman animal hope were selfevident to humans sympathetic humans would generally be less likely to use abuse and dominate nonhuman animals Given wellestablished evolutionary perspectives the obstacle to nonhuman hope is not so much scientific but rather conceptual terminological philosophical and indeed literary What is needed is a way habitually imaginatively and conceptually to grant hope to animals However animal studies scholars understand that there is risk in projecting language and emotions onto nonhuman animals and of thereby supposing that we can fully understand animal experiences Presuming to know can become its own form of domination Litera David P Rando ture that represents beings who are neither human nor traditionally animal can help precisely here Because Ishiguro and Dick write about clones and androids rather than about nonhuman animals their novels can help to imagine and associate hope with nonhu man animals They do so not by falling into the trap of making the subaltern speak 20 as Harawaydrawing on Spivaks seminal essay Does the Subaltern Speakwarns scholars against doing but rather by creating liminal zones between human and nonhuman animals that open imaginative and empathetic spaces in which to explore the hope conditionshopes circumstances experiences and varietiesof dominated nonhumans These novels fulfill Weils criteria for critical anthropomorphism they allow us to touch and be touched by others as fellow subjects but without presuming that we can finally know the hopes of nonhuman animals12 These novels convey the injustice of continuing to ignore and deny nonhuman animal hope for instrumental purposes such as breeding laboring experimenting slaughtering and harvesting They help us cultivate a habit of affirming animal hopefulness To cultivate this habit of hopeattribution through fictions of liminality however requires strategies and techniques of reading different from those that literary conventions have conditioned in readers It is less by reading with concentration and more by holding these novels at arms length that such fiction can cultivate new habits of thought about the hopeworlds of nonhuman animals Arms Length Reading and Habitual Reception In Never Let Me Go Tommy above all is associated with animals After his early alienation from the other Hailsham studentsthe cultures euphemism for cloneshe is accepted back in the fold again 8 One student likens Tommys gesture to a dog doing a pee 10 Ruth calls him a mad animal 12 and even Kathy acknowledges that something about Tommy made one think well yes if hes go ing to be that daft he deserves whats coming 9 Kathy echoes Elizabeth Costello in J M Coetzees The Lives of Animals who says If I were asked what the general attitude is toward the animals we eat I would say contempt We treat them badly because we despise them we despise them because they dont fight back 58 When taunted by the other students Tommy does not fight back but rather pitches furious and impotent tantrums Late in the novel after Tommy and Kathy learn that there are no deferrals for their involuntary organ donations Tommy reverts to childhood fury running into an open field raging shouting flinging his fists and kicking out 274 When Tommy returns to the car Kathy says You stink of cow poo Tommy is also associated with animals because of his drawings Kathy calls them imaginary animals 178 and fantastic creatures Tommy draws these animals at the Cottages in a confused and ulti mately futile attempt to impress Madame with his creativity in the hope of a deferral for Ruth and himself Although Tommys draw ings fail to produce a deferral his inhuman art as Shameem Black argues which marries the animal with the automatic provides an alternative to the destructive visions of soulbased humanity that the novel critiques 801 Tommy explains his technique If you make them tiny and you have to because the pages are only about this big then everything changes Its like they come to life by themselves Then you have to draw all these different details for them You have to think about how theyd protect themselves how theyd reach things 178 Kathy is skeptical at first and worries that Tommy is only invit ing more ridicule But when she sees the drawings in the barn we called the goosehouse 186 she is startled by their intricacy So I was taken aback at how densely detailed each one was In fact it took a moment to see they were animals at all The first impression was like one youd get if you took the back off a radio set tiny canals weaving tendons miniature screws and wheels were all drawn with obsessive precision and only when you held the page away could you see it was some kind of armadillo say or a bird 187 emphasis added Kathy may echo readers own reactions to Ishiguros characters when she says of Tommys drawings I was becoming genuinely drawn to these fantastical creatures in front of me For all their busy metallic features there was something sweet even vulnerable about each of them 188 Tommys imaginary animals become a metacommen tary on how Ishiguro draws the characters themselves tiny detailed selfprotecting striving and vulnerable Their minute circuitry aligns them with forms of technological reproduction and cloning such as cassette tapes and radios As strange mixtures of repeatable and replaceable circuitry and unique individuality Tommys creatures center the novels concerns about humans and nonhumans repro duction and repeatability and striving and vulnerability As with Tommys drawings however we can only recognize the students as akin to nonhuman animals when we hold the page farther away and break off from their circuitrys minutiae This is to under take something quite different from conventional reading practices neither the concentration of close reading nor the computation of David P Rando distant reading it is reading at a middle distance at arms length Call it presbyopic reading as in middle age the object only comes into focus when held a certain distance away Never Let Me Go models other forms of reception as repetition and habit as well For example the Hailsham students listen to music with unusual but surprisingly effective innovation The craze was for several people to sit on the grass around a single Walkman passing the headset around Okay it sounds a stupid way to listen to music but it created a really good feeling You listened for maybe twenty seconds took off the headset passed it on After a while provided you kept the same tape going over and over it was surprising how close it was to having heard all of it by yourself 103 These too become instructions for alternate reading strategies To let the story play over and over as we tune in and out or to hold the book away from ourselves until something snaps into focus is to read the novel neither as a literal story about clones nor as an allegorical story about animals In defiance of traditional hermeneutics that call for concentration on the object as demanded by sentimentalism realism and especially as theorized by Adorno modernism we ought not concentrate on the students or interpret them as nonhu man animals Instead aligned with the technologies of cloning and reproducibility as Walter Benjamin theorized them we receive the students as animals in distraction at a certain distance Benjamin writes Distraction and concentration form an antithesis which may be formulated as follows A person who concentrates before a work of art is absorbed by it he enters into the work just as according to legend a Chinese painter entered his completed painting while beholding it By contrast the distracted masses absorb the work of art into themselves Their waves lap around it they encompass it with their tide 119 Never Let Me Go cannot be assimilated into realist sentimental or modernist modes nor can it persist as abstract or in tellectual allegory By situating readers in the oblique space between the literal and the allegorical and by allowing the matter of identity to remain permanently unsettled between concentration and distrac tion the novel allows readers to imagine nonhuman hope in ways that resist the conventionalized forms of representing it For Benjamin reception in distraction is especially valuable at historical junctures when the new cannot be accessed directly through concentration but only by gradual habituation and acclimation to the emergent For the tasks which face the human apparatus of perception at historical turning points cannot be performed solely by optical meansthat is by way of contemplation They are mastered graduallytaking their cue from tactile receptionthrough habit 120 Never Let Me Go works in our transitional moment of thinking about animals the novels vision of nonhuman hope must affect and wash over readers until they begin to form new perceptual habits The following sections examine how Ishiguros hopeful clones and Dicks hopeful androids might be read at arms length distract edly and habitually as a form of critical anthropomorphism compat ible with being touched by the hope of nonhuman others without the distorting and resistanceprovoking presumption that we can finally know the unknowable in them This mode of reception helps readers circumvent the distorting tendency to allegorize clones and androids as nonhuman animals even as these liminal figures help readers overcome the problems of identification and ventriloquism associated with realist and sentimental animal tales Clones Critics of Never Let Me Go have illuminated the novels inhuman or nonhuman challenges to conventional formulations of empathy and humanity For Black the novel reinvents empathy for a posthu manist age 786 by critiquing the limits of empathy in the human and locating selfrecognition and empathy in the inhuman in the mechanical manufactured and replicated Similarly by focusing on how the novel impedes traditional reader identification with protagonists Nancy Armstrong argues that Never Let Me Go pushes readers beyond the limits of sympathetic identification 464 and moves us to acknowledge those with whom we share vital organs yet whom we exclude from the mirroring relationship of sympathy For Anne Whitehead Never Let Me Go discomforts and perplexes readers in order to open up and to hold open central ethical questions of responsiveness interpretation responsibility complicity and care 59 while for Bruce Robbins the novel interrogates the boundary between care and cruelty true caring even love itself would neces sarily have cruelty in it 300 Eluned SummersBremner argues that animals in the novel are the natural foil to manufactured humans but also the regressive excessive element within ordinary humanity 155 from SummersBremners Lacanian perspective art addresses human exile from the land of instincts 147 Critics have thus established Never Let Me Go as a novel adept at challenging barriers within and surrounding the human This section takes the critical discourse of barriers to empathy and humanity in Never Let Me Go in an unexplored direction Examining animal hope in the context of David P Rando Ishiguros clones it articulates overlooked questions in Ishiguro criti cism and animal studies about who hopes and where hope resides By experiencing hope while resisting human and animal categoriza tion Ishiguros liminal clones liberate hope from human clutches Their crushed hopes not only interrogate the nature and limits of human empathy and identification but also dramatize hope in the process of breaking off from the human By allowing readers to be challenged and moved by nonhuman hope Never Let Me Go makes hope available to nonhuman animals in affective and conceptual forms that circumvent anthropomorphic projection presumption ventriloquism and mastery Hailsham students are not the pawns of fate and destiny in the way that traditional tragic heroes are nor does reading about their dashed hopes quite align with tragedys supposed effects of emotional catharsis through pity and fear however strong an emotional response Ishiguros story may elicit Utility rather than individual or communal destiny defines their futures Nor do the students fit neatly into the role of dehumanized people subject to the cruel power and uses of other humans as in certain representations of war slavery and genocide The students otherthanhuman status both in the eyes of the world and the ways in which they uncannily repeat individual humans while challenging the boundaries of the human itself keeps them partially outside of the genres of dehumanization and resists conventional emotional and intellectual responses to them But if Ishiguros students differ from traditional human char acters they also depart from conventional ways of representing nonhuman characters They are too human to fall neatly within the equally wellestablished conventions for representing nonhuman animals For instance they cannot be read as talking horses as in Sewells sentimental Black Beauty or Leo Tolstoys realist short story Strider In sentimental and realist modes respectively Sewell and Tolstoy depict their horses lives of cruel utility Sewells Ginger an abused horse delivers a sentimental speech shortly before her death Its no use men are strongest and if they are cruel and have no feel ing there is nothing that we can do but just bear it bear it on and on to the end I wish the end was come I wish I was dead I have seen dead horses and I am sure they do not suffer pain I wish I may drop down dead at my work and not be sent off to the knackers 162 Tolstoy renders Striders fatal visit from the knacker in realist style Theyre treating me of course theyre going to cure me he thought Let them Indeed he felt them do something to his throat It hurt and he shuddered and kicked out with one leg but he restrained himself and waited to see what else would happen What happened next was that he felt something liquid running in a thick stream down his neck and chest He heaved a deep sigh Then he felt much better 113 While Ishiguro draws on both sentimentalism and realism at different times Tolstoys and Sewells modes of nonhuman animal representa tion nonetheless align just as poorly with Never Let Me Go as the genres of tragedy and dehumanization do Instead the Hailsham students fall between categories and thus between forms of representation Instead of relying on such conventions the pathos of the Hailsham students derives from the novels carefully represented dialectics of hope and utility in an otherthanhuman context while simultaneously making it difficult to see the students as traditional nonhuman animals For instance the compassionate Miss Lucy admits to the children None of you will go to America none of you will be film stars And none of you will be working in supermarkets as I heard some of you planning the other day Your lives are set out for you Youll become adults then before youre old before youre even middleaged youll start to donate your vital organs Thats what each of you was created to do 81 Differing from Gingers sentiment and Striders realism both of which seem calculated to affect readers viscerally Miss Lucys tone is flatly unvisceral even though her topic is evisceration Not only are exotic hopes of being film stars out of the question but so are more mundane ambitions such as working in a supermarket or as Ruth later fantasizes an office Even the expectation of aging is dashed by the students ironclad futures And yet Hailsham students maintain their hopes in the face of certain instrumentalization The resiliency of their hope is part of their lives pathos Miss Lucy tells them If youre going to have decent lives then youve got to know and know properly But the students ability to know and know properly is limited not only by their careful Hailsham indoctrination neurosis willful not knowing and improperly knowing also perpetuate their hopes Childhood at Hailsham revolves around preserving illusions in the face of encroaching realities as exemplified by Ruths secret guard for Miss Geraldine Even without evidence that Miss Geraldine was threatened and needed protecting we each played our part in pre serving the fantasy 52 When the students reach adolescence and are more directly confronted with the truths of their existences they manage this knowledge neurotically through jokes We still didnt David P Rando discuss the donations and all that went with them    But it became something we made jokes about in much the way we joked about sex 84 Even at the Cottages the older students who have become carers while not actual taboo 132 subjects are rarely mentioned Although the novel makes fully identifying the students with nonhuman animals impossible Never Let Me Go plays extensively on human identitybased discourses about nonhumans Identitybased approaches regard nonhuman animals according to the relative de gree to which they possess traits and abilities that have traditionally been considered human Philosophers such as Aristotle Descartes and Kant have denied rights personhood and protections to non human animals based on their perceived lack of ethically relevant traits Calarco 4 or their supposed dissimilarity from human ani mals Darwinian evolutionary theory calls into question the categori cal distinctions that are common in the philosophical tradition by demonstrating continuity rather than difference Both utilitarian and rightsbased proanimal ethical approaches emerge from this understanding Nonetheless as Matthew Calarco writes when animal ethicists locate    quintessential human capacities say intentional ity or subjectivity among animals and build an ethics based on that shared identity they are not displacing anthropocentrism but are instead offering another iteration of it 26 The search for the hu man in the nonhuman is itself an anthropocentric enterprise even when it is conducted for the welfare or rights of nonhuman animals Never Let Me Go intervenes here through its discourse about the students relative capacities particularly through their capacities for creativity love and hope The students largely tie their hopes to ques tions of human capacities they see the basis of their hope as hinging on the extent to which they can evince these capacities Indeed Ma dame and Miss Emily had hoped that Hailsham would demonstrate to the world that because students possess certain capacities they must also have souls We took away your art because we thought that it would reveal your souls Or to put it more finely we did it to prove you had souls at all 260 While students elsewhere were reared in deplorable conditions 261 Hailshams freerange model set out to show the world that if students were reared in humane cultivated environments it was possible for them to grow to be as sensitive and intelligent as any ordinary human being However as Maren Tova Linett demonstrates the cognitive dissonance 145 in Hailshams approach which understands the students as cultured creative and intelligent 143 people who are simultaneously killable makes the Hailsham model unsustainable even as it exposes a similar contra diction at the heart of humane farming 145 Hailshams identity based approach to improving the way that students are treated loses out to the premium that humans place on anthropocentric utility While Madame and Miss Emily see artistic creativity as possible evidence of a soul the students regard creativity as evidence that they can truly love While Hailsham makes its argument through an implicitly empiricistrealist modestudents are creative therefore they have soulsthe students see their appeal to loving in an implic itly sentimentalist mode Chrissie hears the rumor that if Hailsham students could prove they were properly in love 153 they could receive a threeyear deferral from becoming carers Kathy reflecting on why Madame might have cried when she witnessed Kathy swaying to music and clutching her pillow supposes that Madame had been emotionally moved by Kathys demonstrated capacity to love Shed have supposed I was holding a lover in my arms    shed be really moved stumbling on a scene like that 177 Kathy learns much later that Madame had not connected the scene to love at all and had read Kathy quite differently For Madame Kathy was a little girl holding the old kind world 272 to her breast in the face of the hard cruel world that was coming rapidly Madame says I saw something else    It wasnt really you what you were doing I know that 272 Kathy imagined that Madame had been moved by senti ment but Madame had actually been moved by Kathy as allegory as something else as an otherspeaking figure Through the students hopes about being creative and having the capacity to love Never Let Me Go dramatizes what nonhuman hope might look like and how it might have a persuasive force If it is to be persuasive Never Let Me Go must be kept distinct from allegory on the one hand and from sentimentalism and realism on the other Reading in the distracted and habituating mode we see what nonhu man hope looks like when it falls outside of generic conventions and eludes traditional reading practices Miss Emily David P Rando turbing process Never Let Me Go represents is how thwarted hope gets rerouted into memory13 The novel dramatizes the wrenching mental processes by which the students are forced from hope into memory with the result that compensatory anamnesis and rumination replace a wishful sense of futurity Kathy says I was never the sort of kid who brooded over things for hours on end Ive got that way a bit these days but thats the work I do and the long hours of quiet when Im driving across these empty fields 58 The novels narrating clone dwells in memory and nostalgia during human young adulthood a time typically devoted to building an adult life and looking ahead with hope Kathys perverse shift from hopeful expectation to elegiac memory so badly distorts human life that the pain of dashed hope is dramatized in the very telling of the tale Androids Critics of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep often see the novel as opening displacing or radically transforming the human through its intersections with nonhuman animals and androids Ursula K Heise not only sees the novel as a potential indictment of Western cultures fundamental insensitivity to and relentless exploitation of animals 73 but also sees it as accepting technology to a certain extent as a replacement for irrecuperably lost nature 74 In contrast Vint shows that the novel puts androids in the place historically occu pied by animals Speciesism and Species 113 as the mechanical Cartesian other of humanity For Vint the novel is about the need for humans to resist our own androidlike and capitalist rationality by cultivating empathy with animals and resisting speciesism14 For Jill Galvan human encounters with androids and commodified animals in the novel interrogate a fixed definition of the human subject and at last acknowledge him as only one component of the living scene 414 Tony M Vinci sees trauma in the novel as temporarily liberating characters from essentialized human subjectivity and thus of opening us up to transsubjective engagements with the android and the animal that facilitate a radical posthuman ethics of expansive vulnerability 9415 For Casey R Riffel it is not trauma but rather apocalypse and historical rupture that make possible new forms of species relations 160 By reading the novel as a critique of capitalist exploitation instrumental rationality speciesism and anthropocen trism critics have positioned Dicks androids and nonhuman animals to challenge and reimagine the human in nonanthropocentric post capitalist and posthuman forms However Dicks android challenge to the human has unexplored implications for understanding non human animals as well This section examines the consequences of Dicks android representations for conceptualizations of nonhuman animals particularly in the field of hope Like the hopes of Ishiguros clones android hope in Dick dislocates hope from humans In the process it challenges the presumption that humans possess hope as such in its undivided fullness simultaneously liberating hope in a way that potentially enfranchises nonhuman animal others within the privileged construct of hope As in Never Let Me Go in Do Androids Dream humans discrimi nate against androids on the basis of capacities Androids resemble humans in virtually every way but for humans what decisively distin guishes androids is their inability to empathize Hope is central to the android experience but the way in which Dick represents empathy crucially contextualizes android hope Since the advent of androids a religion premised on the capacity to empathize has emerged in the world of the novel An android no matter how gifted as to pure in tellectual capacity could make no sense out of the fusion which took place routinely among the followers of Mercerism 29 Whatever else Mercerism might be it is also a spiritual and ideological develop ment that allows humans to retain a sense of exception as android technology throws the category of the human into crisis Dick reflects the tendency for humans to take a capacitiesbased approach for dif ferentiating themselves from nonhuman animals As de Waal writes Keeping humans in their preferred spot on that absurd scale of the ancient Greeks has led to an obsession with semantics definitions and redefinitions andlets face itthe moving of goalposts 157 Vexing this tendency however each new generation of androids in Do Androids Dream is more sophisticated intelligent and difficult to differentiate from human beings As in Never Let Me Go the tenuous sense of human distinctive ness is supposed to justify the instrumental use and killing of non humans in Do Androids Dream An imputed lack of empathy licenses humans to treat androids as Cartesian animalmachines not unlike electric sheep Rachael Rosen compares her fellow androids to ants Chitinous reflexmachines who arent really alive 178 She says We are machines stamped out like bottle caps Its an illusion that II personallyreally exist Im just representative of a type 173 Bounty hunters such as Rick Deckard hunt and kill androids without having to empathize with their victims or to question the morality of doing so As in Never Let Me Go killing is euphemized Hailsham students complete illegal andys 4 are retired David P Rando However the novel is practically anarchic when it comes to empathy and who possesses it In spite of their reputed coldness androids can form friendships and care about each other Led by Roy Baty the escaped androids have experimented with mindfusing drugs    to promote in androids a group experience similar to that of Mercerism 16970 The eight escaped androids empathize with each other and feel pain when their friends are killed When Deckard kills Irmgard Roy Baty    lets out a cry of anguish 205 This response leads Deckard to recognize an equivalency Okay you loved her Rick said And I loved Rachael Although the mechanical Cartesian view should preclude view ing androids empathetically the novel also presents evidence of hu man empathy toward androids Deckards wife Iran calls them poor andys 4 and Deckard begins to empathize with certain female androids and to love Rachael Rosen a development that threatens his work as a bounty hunter However the novel shows that the desire not to empathize can powerfully forestall empathy Deckard successfully battles his empathetic response in order to continue killing androids Ironically while Rick looks into the empathy box and experiences fusion Mercer tells him Go and do your task even though you know it is wrong 164 The imperative is so powerful that it remains entrenched even after it is grasped as wrong No matter how personally distasteful it becomes for Rick to retire androids his work remains ideologically and instrumentally essential Rick sees his particular form of suffering as worse than Mercers endless torment because Rick is required to violate his own identity If humans in the novel identify themselves through empathy then to act unempathetically is also to question the basic assumptions that underwrite human identity What is especially anarchic about Dicks novel and what makes it a crucial counterpart to Never Let Me Go is that it not only raises the possibility that nonhumans possess capacities denied to them but also assails the wellentrenched as sumptions that humans possess capacities we pride ourselves on Dick mirrors Derridas deconstructive approach to the nonhuman which consists of questioning not only what humans deny to nonhuman animals but also of questioning the cherished abilities that humans attribute to themselves It is not just a matter of asking whether one has the right to refuse the animal such and such a power speech reason experience of death mourning culture institutions technics clothing lying pretense of pretense covering of tracks gift laughter crying respect etcthe list is necessarily without limit and the most powerful philosophical tradition in which we live has refused the animal all of that It also means asking whether what calls itself human has the right rigorously to attribute to man which means therefore to attribute to himself what he refuses the animal and whether he can ever possess the pure rigorous indivisible concept as such of that attribution 135 Dicks novel questions the extent to which humans can possess the pure rigorous indivisible capacity for empathy By what right do Deckard and other humans call themselves empathetic As his fusion experience demonstrates Deckard must perform acrobatic rational izations to have his empathy and kill androids too The latest test used in the novel to identify androids the Voigt Kampff Empathy Test discriminates according to the ability to empathize with nonhuman animals Test takers are meant to react physiologically when the test administrator describes bearskin rugs lobsters boiled alive and wallmounted deer heads However Ricks own response to seeing or hearing about nonhuman animals is im mediately to consult his creased muchstudied copy of Sidneys Animal  Fowl Catalogue 9 to ascertain its exchange value For Rick animals are not to be empathized with but possessed owning animals assuages social pressures and signals prestige As Vint says if empathy were as important to the experience of human culture as it is to the ideology of the humanandroid boundary then owning a real animal should be a social relationship not a commodity one 11916 Instead as animals have become rarer within the world of the novel they generally seem more commodified than empathized with According to supply and demand animals are simply too scarce and expensive any longer to abuse kill or eat Given this instrumen talized human perspective Megan E Cannella sees animals as the guardians of unmediated emotion 147 in the novel After Rick discovers that he has begun to empathize with certain androids he becomes even more desperate to own an animal Buy ing a goat helps him to cope emotionally with his job Ive begun to empathize with androids he tells Iran Thats why I bought the goat I never felt like that before Maybe it could be a depression like you get I can understand now how you suffer when you are de pressed 161 Rick fixates on exchange value to the very last when he finds what appears to be a living toad First he swiftly dragged out his muchcreased Sidneys 217 and then finding that toads are extinct and knowing that an extinct animal can bring a reward running into millions of dollars 218 Rick thinks I need a box 217 A further irony about Deckards mercenary view of animals is that the toad is the critter most precious to Wilbur Mercer the para David P Rando gon of fusion and empathy The empathetic basis for discriminating between human and android is belied by the persistent and cultur ally entrenched human tendency to calculate coldly about animals Androids also expose the lie of human empathy Irmgard Baty says without the Mercer experience we just have your word that you feel this empathy business this shared group thing 193 Or as Buster Friendly puts it more bluntly Mercerism is a swindle The ones with the strongest shared group thing in the novel are the escaped androids Indeed humans and androids both need a supplement to feel empathy The androids need mindaltering drugs but the humans who pride themselves on the innate capacity for empathy nonetheless require the prosthesis of an empathy box that displays an actor against a backdrop of sky and daytime moon 190 The evil Killers 30 in Mercerite theology turn out not only to be the androids as Rick supposes but the humans as well Each is Mercer and Killer each can love and kill coldly at the same time The android Pris coldly snips off four of a spiders legs with scissors but Deckard picks off six of eight androids one for nearly every leg of a spider Like Derrida Dick shows that when it comes to the qualities that humans generously assign to themselves and parsimoniously withhold from others the sky is often painted Within this destabilizing context of empathy the novel suggests that nonhuman hope is widespread All androids who escape to Earth act out of hope for freedom and they are numerous enough to support a worldwide network of bounty hunters As Garland tells Rick about escaping from Mars Its a chance anyway breaking free and coming here to Earth where were not even considered animals 113 Do androids dream Rick asked himself Evidently thats why they occasionally kill their employers and flee here A better life without servitude 169 Dreams of a better life are the essence of hope and utopia Blochs original title for The Principle of Hope was Dreams of a Better Life and he observes How richly people have always dreamed of this dreamed of the better life that might be possible 3 The plot of Do Androids Dream is shaped by Roy Batys dreams of a better life Baty radically proposes the sacredness of socalled android life 169 a utopian notion if there ever were one The popularity of precolonial fiction among Martians and in Batys cell particularly also manifests the utopian impulse in the androids As Pris says of these stories written before space travel but about space travel 139 You can imagine what it might have been like What Mars ought to be like 140 The title of the novel poses the question of android hope and it turns out that rather than electric sheep which is more or less what Deckard shallowly dreams about androids dream of freedom Do Androids Dream takes a different route from Never Let Me Go to imagining nonhuman hope Dick is just as likely to question the foundation and character of human hope as he is to represent hope in androids Not only can mechanical androids hope but also as in the case of human empathy there turns out to be something mechanical and impoverished about human hope Isidore tells Pris that an empathy box is the most personal possession you have Its an extension of your body its the way you touch other humans its the way you stop being alone 62 When Iran wants to snap out of her feelings of despair she programs 481 into her Penfield mood organ Awareness of the manifold possibilities open to me in the future new hope that 6 Devilishly Dick demonstrates that hu man hopedreams of a better life sense of a future openness of possibilitysometimes requires mechanical supplementation This erodes the prejudice reflected by Bloch that hope is innately and uniquely human but it does so from the opposite direction of Never Let Me Go Because mechanical androids dream of a better world not only must nonhuman animals be admitted into the circle of hope but also hope itself must be demystified and dereified as essentially human Nonhuman Hope Drawing on the defamiliarizing and transformative possibilities of scifi Ishiguros and Dicks novels circumvent conventional concep tions and representations of nonhuman animal hope Because these novels are not directly about nonhuman animals they can avoid representing nonhuman hope in realist sentimental and allegorical modes For all their benefit to animal studies these traditional modes nonetheless can still reflect and maintain considerable resistances and barriers to rethinking nonhuman animal hope By looking at nonhuman animals obliquely and at arms distance even distract edly and mechanically through the minute circuitry of clones and androids these novels help readers imaginatively loosen the jealous human grip on hope They allow hope more readily to pass across species To demystify human hope as mechanically reflexive or tech nologically mediated as Dick does is similarly to erode the basis for denying socalled authentic hope to nonhuman animals David P Rando To attribute hoperather than simply futureplanning or delayed gratificationto nonhumans is to make it harder to accept the inhumane and brutal instrumental treatment of thinking and feeling fellow beings under capitalist production The form and the aim of distracted and habitual reading proposed here may seem like wishful thinking empty hope and utopian daydreaming However Bloch shows how daydreams are not only as Freud would have it idle compensatory fantasies Another part of the daydream is provocative is not content just to accept the bad which exists does not accept renunciation This other part has hoping at its core and is teachable 317 Further he writes The daydream can furnish inspirations which do not require interpreting but working out it builds castles in the air as blueprints too and not always just fictitious ones 8618 Ishiguro and Dick present provocations with hope at their core They are not content with the bad that exists nor should we be Besides concentrating on and interpreting these novels we ought also to let them inspire daydreams idle and compensatory on the one hand but possible blueprints for a better world on the other a world that rethinks and remakes the breaks between and among all animals Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep are dys topian novels that picture nightmarish parallel histories or futures However they are utopian novels as well because in Jamesons terms they allow us to think the break 232 itself or to imagine the sta tus quo disrupted Ishiguro and Dick represent nonhuman hope in unusually challenging and genredefying ways Read strategically their novels challenge the discourse of hope in ways that cut across accustomed habits and conventions for representing nonhuman animals They can help to redistribute our precious but most preju dicially parceled out hope Finally the discourse of nonhuman animal capacities is insepa rable from the question of fictions capacities Debates about animal capacities are also literary debates about what fiction can do to chal lenge and change readers minds and hearts as well as what readers can do to strategically harness fictions affordances Read through acts of deliberate critical anthropomorphism Ishiguros and Dicks novels about clones and androids help to enfranchise nonhuman animals habitually into the privilege estate and dignity of hope In this way clones and androids might help to make a better life for nonhuman animals than humans alone have so far been capable of doing I wish to thank Elena Nusloch Mellon Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow at Trinity University in 2020 for her meticulous and conscien tious assistance while researching this essay 1 I follow Bloch as treating hope as an emotion though as DeKoven David P Rando anthropomorphism and the enduring Cartesian view of animals as ma chinelike Calarco succinctly summarizes the Cartesian view Starting from mechanistic premises Descartes argues that animals although alive and capable of sensation are essentially indistinguishable from machines and that their behavior can be fully explained without recourse to notions such as mind and selfawareness Animals in his account are complex automata beings that can react to external stimuli but lack the ability to know that such reactions are taking place 9 8 Although he rejects animal studies as a field name Lundblad sug gests that the subfields that comprise it reflect different priorities with different aims or ends in mind rather than rigid distinctions without overlap 2 9 Fraiman observes Without giving a single example relying entirely on other scholars for a blanket indictment of cultural studies as incoherent and vague Wolfe blames these qualities for helping to obscure what remains a normative conception of subjectivity despite the rhetorical inclusion of animals 104 Responding to Fraiman Lundblad calls for sharper distinctions between subfields However in this study my framing aligns with Fraiman I will also use animal studies in its broad est contemporary sense to mean the sprawling multidisciplinary field known by some as animality studies or humananimal studies and not to be confused with the scientific usage meaning lab studies involving animals 90n2 10 By focusing on hope I do not minimize any other common emotions that scholars and critics have found between humans and nonhumans I mean to support these efforts against human exceptionalism and anthropodenial by focusing on overlooked hope 11 Calarco identifies three main approaches to the relationship between humans and animals identity difference and indistinctionbased 12 Humility about how much we can finally know of the experiences and inner lives of nonhuman animals is another tenet of animal studies as Waldau conceptualizes them identifying the nature of any and all limits as to what humans might know about other living beings is a key task requiring honesty constant work and liberal doses of humility 6 13 Mhire and Hernandez argue that Ishiguro finds hope in the students decency but that in a flattened world with no families no gods and no ambition hope in the future is replaced with a fondness for the past 221 Mhire and Hernandez consistently claim that Ishiguro regards Never Let Me Go as his most hopeful novel though in the interview they cite Ishiguro actually calls it my cheerful novel Ishiguro attributes this cheerfulness to the students decency I wanted to show three people who were essentially decent When they finally realize that their time is limited I wanted them not to be preoccupied with their status or their material possessions I wanted them to care most about each other and setting things right So for me it was saying positive things about human beings against the rather bleak fact of our mortality Kazuo Ishiguro 52 14 Vint writes the central role of animals in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and the issues of species being that they raise show the need to struggle for a dif ferent way of being in the world This way resists commodification in our relations with one another and with nature to produce a better future one in which humans might be fully human once again by repairing our social relations with animals and nature Speciesism and Species 125 15 Building on Vincis work Olsen discusses how the possibility of android trauma blurs the boundaries between machines and humans thus undermining anthropocentrism 102 16 Vint rightly attributes this contradiction to capitalist alienation Deck ards struggle to have a noncommodity relationship with animals and others within the novel reveals the damage that capitalist modes of rela tion have done to his subjectivity but also point given Deckards ability to change to a potential way out of such damaging social structures Speciesism and Species 120 17 According to Freud We may lay it down that a happy person never phantasies only an unsatis fied one The motive forces of phantasies are unsatisfied wishes and every single phantasy is the fulfilment of a wish a correction of unsatisfying reality These motivating wishes vary according to the sex character and circumstances of the person who is having the phantasy but they fall naturally into two main groups They are either ambitious wishes which serve to elevate the subjects personality or they are erotic ones 439 18 For Bloch nightdreams are concerned with
