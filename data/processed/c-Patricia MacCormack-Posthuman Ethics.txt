Chapter 1 philosophy has become suspicious of claims about human subjectivity Those subjects who were historically considered aberrant and our future lives becoming increasingly hybrid show we have always been and are continuously transforming into posthumans What are the ethical considerations of thinking the posthuman creates new imaginative ways of understanding relations between lives Ethics is a practice of activist adaptive and creative interaction which avoids claims to overarching moral structures Inherent in thinking posthuman ethics is the status of bodies as the site of lives inextricable from philosophy thought experiments in being and fantasies of the future Posthuman Ethics examines certain kinds of bodies to think new relations that offer liberty and a contemplation of the practices of power which have been exerted upon bodies operations of knowledge power and majoritarian systems Michel Foucault states I wonder whether before one poses the question of ideology it wouldnt be Pore PateriaOist to stud first the Tuestion of the bod and the effeFts of Sower on it 1980 58 Posthuman Ethics could have been called Posthuman Bodies in reference to the crucial status of bodies in posthuman philosophy The body reFonfiJurinJ reOation and ethiFaO ePerJenFes of bodies beond beinJ reFeiYed through representation external and within consciousness negotiating reality through representative perception is the foundation and the site of the event of the SosthuPan enFounter 7houJht and Àesh the distanFe between bodies and ethics constituted through aesthetics are three trajectories along which Posthuman expression and force by encounters with and events of alterity Benedict Spinozas ethics directly challenges the Cartesian necessitation of the bifurcation between mind and body which act upon each other in turn Whichever turn precedes the other their alienation is complete and thus the distribution from internal body to the body of the polis as the state imposing upon docile bodies and obedient or resistant bodies acting upon the state failed to account for some basic but foundational tenets of the posthuman that there is no body without the mind and that they are not separate because they are not separate they cannot be ordered hierarchically that the mind as corporeal thus proves consciousness is not given thereby will and affects are never entirely accounted for predictable or discrete Posthuman Ethics FaSaFit for eSerienFinJ Pore and Oess benefiFiaO affeFts and deJrees of aSSetite In Spinoza will comes from the mind appetite from the body but these are different ways of expressing the interactions which occur within and uniquely for each thing The desire to persist is all that constitutes a thing and that which makes the thing unlike any other which gives the thing its essence Between things there is no commonality except a harmony which enhances joy or exercises destruction further sSeFifiFit 7he endeaYour to eist defines the eistenFe of the thinJ but the nature of its existence is not transparent Taking the central notion of desire around which much Continental Philosophy resonates will of the mind  at once clear distinct and confused  and appetite of the body is in fact nothing else but mans essence from the nature of which necessarily follow all the results which tend to its preservation  further between appetite and desire there is no difference  whatever increases or diminishes helps or hinders the power of activity in our body the idea thereof increases or diminishes helps or hinders the power of thought in our mind Spinoza 1957 36 Gilles Deleuze summarizes Spinozas contribution by stating what is action in the mind is necessarily an action in the body as well and what is a passion in the body is necessarily a passion in the mind There is no primacy of one series over the other Deleuze 1988b 18 A things essence comes from its capacity to act as a form of preservation Preservation is developed by a things sustenance of its essence Preservation is essence and the capacity to act the freedom of the thing as an inYoOution of Àesh and Pind 7he tendenF to SreserYation is what Pakes eaFh thing a singular event of life but preservation is of life alone over its inherent nature or quality Preservation is active as expressive and is separate from any notion of the preservation of a things sameness to itself For Spinoza thought is a things power to increase that is to alter transform develop and expand so the differentiation of the thing directly correlates with its liberty Ethics as a system of relation makes each things essence come from preservation irreducibly indeSendent froP FonfirPation of siPiOarit to itseOf at eaFh PoPent 7he Jift of liberty is allowing the power of the other to expand toward unknown futures To diminish the others capacity to multiply and extend its capacities is in Spinoza hate Hate is a form of pleasure  he who conceives the object of his hate is destroyed will feel pleasure 1957 41 Thus all force both love and hate is desire And all force is affect1 But further Posthuman Ethics will base ethics on 1 Seigworth points to the mistranslation of affect which in most English editions of Spinoza translations is emotion He describes the failure of singular emotion to account for affectio and affectus and then the soul which from two to three become multitudinous affeFtiYit 1 as desFribed b eOeue 6Sinoa defines desire froP whiFh aOO affeFts come as already at least three by which all other emotions arise 1957 37 It is clear Posthuman Ethics the premise that all conception is hateful ethics in a deliberate truncated reading of Spinozas claim this book will claim that he who conceives the object destroys the object imposing a claim upon a body conditional on monodirectional exertions of perception as conception limiting expressivity without limit Ethical encounters are different to Kants morality of benevolent totalizing ascension without TuaOifiFation for whiFh aesthetiFs and thereb a Fertain definition of representation and perception is responsible The distance even though unknowable between things by which Kant and Hegel operate even taking into account Hegels criticism of Kants claim natural beauty is co equivalent with spiritual and artistic is closed with Spinozas intimacy of organisms liberated or oppressed by expression of the other by the self and the openings to joy which seek to expand through thought without knowledge2 Serres opposes perception as a war waged against creation as an act of love The text on perception ends with conception Serres 2000 3839 Further to this Spinoza says the world would be much happier if men were as fully able to keep silence as they are to speak 1957 30 original emphasis Bodies in inextricable proximity involve a threefold ethical consideration  the critique of the detrimental effect a claim to knowledge of another body perpetrates address as creative expressivity opening the capacity for the other to express acknowledgement and celebration of the diffiFuOt new assteP of bioreOations as an onJoinJ irresoOYabOe but ethiFaO for being so interactive mediative project of desire Fèlix Guattari calls this sense without signification 2011 59 a language of sensation between Unspoken Friendship As the colour of the human soul as well as the colour of human becomings and of cosmic magics affects remain hazy atmospheric and nevertheless perfectly apprehensible to the extent that it is characterized by the existence of threshold effects and reversals in polarity Guattari 1996b 158 Just as Spinoza claims SerfeFtion is the finitude of the huPan Pind whereas µnature does not work with an end in view 1957 79 the liberated soul apprehends very well the perfection of something without needing to have made an exhausted judgement Perfection is found in encounters with the nature of things and their nature is their expansive quality that therefore expands the qualities of thought of we who encounter For Guattari this ethics of perfection comes from threshold effects The liminal encounter with the luminal body both expands a things expressivity and allows the other to be without finitude that is without knowOedJe diPinishinJ a thinJs capacity to preservation through its own essence free from the bondage of anothers Seigworth Deleuze and Spinoza each account for desire as expressivity power passion and action while attending to its inexhaustible and mysterious multiplicity and mobility 2 Primarily after Deleuze a new vitalistic triumverate of ethics has been developed of Spinoza Bergson and Nietzsche Posthuman Ethics claim to know that essence Ethical encounters with liminal bodies of which our own is also always one are good for both things It is an act of love between things based on their difference Thingness itself is hazy atmospheric and fuzzy but is connected with and belongs harmoniously to all other planes of expression To assuPe that there was a Sower of beinJ affeFted whiFh defined the Sower of beinJ affected of the whole universe is quite possible Deleuze 1997 9 Importantly Deleuze calls Spinozas a practical philosophy that is a philosophy of practice3 where ethics takes us away from the God toward which humanist PetaShsiFs asSires  be that FaSitaO OoJiF or reOiJious doJPa  toward the Àesh which constitutes life The posthuman as an ethical practice is a practice toward life itself or rather lives  real singular and connective uniquely emergent without predictable development and directly addressed lives for which we seek to expand the FaSaFit to eSress µ6Sinoa SroMeFts an iPaJe of the SositiYe affirPatiYe Oife which stands in opposition to the semblances that men are content with Deleuze 1988b 12 For humanisms compulsion to taxonomy and hierarchy in science and religion philosophy and art semblance often emerges as resemblance The fieOd of SosthuPan thiFs deal with life which resembles nothing except itself and not consistent with itself temporally only tactically Posthuman ethics sees the dividuation of life in opposition to identity as it acknowledges the inevitable connection between living bodies as the point of ethical address and in a seeming postmodern conundrum the individual is constituted only by its connection to other individuals The connection is from where the ethical activation of the body is delivered from its place in the taxonomy atop which rides the human occurs No body without mind no individuality without connection no connection without another dividuated life with its own concomitant reality no affect without expression will as appetite beyond consciousness and perhaps most importantly no thought or theory without materiality Resonant with Spinozan ethics is Guattaris emphasis on the bod as site of PaFhiniF oSeration between knowOedJe and Àesh uattari FaOOs the act of interpretation or knowing a body the massacre of the body He writes It is the body and all the desires it produces that we wish to liberate from foreign domination It is on that ground that we wish to work for the liberation of society There is no boundary between the two elements I oppress myself inasmuch as that I is the product of a system of oppression that extends to all aspects of living  We can no longer allow others to turn our mucous membranes our skin all our sensitive area into occupied territory  territory controlled and regimented by others to which we are forbidden access 1996a 301  ritinJ on eOeues inÀuenFe on

seOfknowinJ huPan with the infinite series of reOationaO forFes esirinJ bodies do not seek an object but as an ethics of desire interactive forces seek the best possible affects those which bring joy Liberty for the other is the joy of opening the others capacity for expression without conditional attribution of equivalent qualities which match the self or are subjugated through a failure of equivalence If deconstruction challenges and critiques the machines that occupy the territories of our aSSetiteÀesh then ethiFs seeks to resist that FoPSuOsion toward the other Maurice Blanchot describes ethics in this passivity that is constituted not by absence or powerlessness but friendship Against responsibility for the other that needs to know to what we are responsible friendship is the response without condition it is in friendship that I can respond a friendship unshared without reciprocity friendship for that which has passed leaving no trace This is passivitys response to the unpresence of the unknown Blanchot 1995 27 Passing and passivity evoke encounters beyond demand and within an absolute SresentSresenFe with a Fontet defiant of an SositiYeneJatiYe SossibiOit of ePerJent TuaOified SresenFe Must SresenFe as unSresenFe and thus SassiYit oSen to unknowability is the ethical activity of passivity Their subtle relation is of the coemergent and indivisible Describing passivity as active shows the dynamism of ethiFs and the Tuiet PaJnifiFenFe of JraFe harOes 6tiYaOes interSretation of force as affect states The force of this Blanchots unpredictable then would serve paradoxically as much as a potential for grasping the friends thought as it does to limit that accessibility 2008 72 Just as many Continental philosophers have associated creativity thought and subjectivity beond subMeFtifiFation with a kind of madness schizoanalysis delirium Blanchot states but when ethics goes mad in its turn as it must what does it contribute if not a safe conduct which allows our conduct no rights leaves us no space to move an ensures us of no salvation It allows only the endurance of a double patience for patience is double too  speakable unspeakable patience 1995 27 Posthuman Ethics share in Continental philosophys end of master and metanarrative discourse where the end of discourse opens up to life In as much as Posthuman Ethics are about certain forms of life they are ultimately about the end of speaking of life as the beginning of lives being ethically open to living Opening to bodies considered dehuman devolved aberrant or outside requires a speakable patience which speaks only its own patience The other is outside discourse therefore unspeakable Our own human need for rights to equal some kind of equality payoff which the other neither wants nor needs if it requires fuOfiOPent of huPan Friteria are our need not that of the other Blanchot points out that ethics is the madness of the doingnot doing of passivity of a certain kind as activism silence as allowing the other to be heard Posthuman Ethics attend to the turn in Continental philosophy that when we speak of the IOther we are speaking Posthuman Ethics of the self as its own othered multiplicity that dialectics have little relevance and opposition is discarded as inherent in the ethical turn The space between the I Other is one of inevitable connection and we are always and already othered otherable whether we belong to the bodies explored in Posthuman Ethics Indeed it must always be remembered while reading Posthuman Ethics that any and all Posthuman Ethics with which novelty may be introduced a need not to further established trajectories but multiply and fracture them a leap over a chasm for which no paths have yet been built toward a territory with which no one is familiar In this renegade movement post also interrogates its motives for moving  demarcating the blind spots in theory which are presumed unimportant or nonexistent acknowledging and reworking the conditions under which knowledges emerge decentring the homogenization and unifiFation of the orderinJ of ideas and SerFeiYed truths  deFonstruFtinJ the present and being the nomadic parentless destiny it refutes taxonomy genealogy and guaranteed futurity In its generative reconnective comings post seeks to disorder the ordering of thought converted to knowledge JeanFrançois Lyotards seminal The Postmodern Condition traces the critics of post in the case of postmodernism as crying out for a demand  the demand for a referent objective reality sense as transcendence addressor addressee and consensus 1984 73 What amalgamates the disparate critics and their various not necessarily commensurable demands is their need for order which expresses as desire for unity identity security and a consistent public perception 1984 73 A conundrum of post already arises here  the criticism of post is already postmodern in its disparity One of the tactics these FritiFs use is rather than stand and fiJht the OiTuidate the strenJths of the affeFts of postmodernisms commitment through mixing and merging postmodern experiments and creativity into a homogenous tepid dilution Lyotard cites the assimilation of the avantgarde heritage by transavantgardism as one example Again post conundrums emerge The mixing process Lyotard sees as destroying the avantgarde could be perceived as resonating with the mixing process post culture performs through some of its key buzzwords  bricolage hybridization multiplicity Lyotards is a crucial warninJ Yen in its disSarit FritiFs are unified eYen in the PuOtiSOiFities Freated through assimilation radicalism is diluted and unrecognisable even in a pseudo address through socalled new trans movements creativity is purged and even though the avantgarde has a heritage its temporality is neither genealogy nor linear This small example from Lyotard establishes a key premise of post  there is nothing necessarily post in posttheories and there is nothing inherently antipost in histories of thought In this way there is no time in post or rather post offers a different time Time continues to haunt theories of the post Katherine Hayles ubiquitous stud of the SosthuPan is defiantO retrosSeFtiYe in its titOe µow e eFaPe PostHuman which coalesces the ironic turn in posthuman theory with the perversion of tracing a

SosthuPan At the beginning of this book  at the end of the book  283 my emphasis Some theorists doubly inverse post theory by their reinvention of and potentially nostalgia for humanism and modernism George Myerson sees ecopathology  a kind of committed new reason deconstructing the destruction of ecologies from earth to self  as a radical potential for an alternative modernism 56 original emphasis He titles his book Ecology and the End of Postmodernism Time is clearly a spectre which haunts post theories through our insistence on reversing Posthuman Ethics it in our posthuman futures what we seek to be we have already become and ending it in order to think anew through what we already thought we had ended While time is not a major theme of this book its persistence elucidates that in all criticisms of and questions about the now is the postmodern splintering of grand narratives that have been and importantly threaten to be This comes with the shocking realization that these narratives have always been postmodern in their disagreements and our post futures are not guaranteed to deliver us from unifying discourses but at worst smugly seduce us into seeing anything post as beyond what has been The ordering of things does not cease in our criticisms of it Time is not necessarily an important element of post theory but it seems an important element in how we think we should think about post theory4 From what hopes does this belief come Here is raised some of the not entirely definabOe definiteO nonehaustibOe SerFeiYed differenFes in definitions of the primary posts which concern posthuman theory While Hayles sees the posthuman as already been this should not vindicate or forget the irrefutable compulsion to a Yer sSeFifiF kind of futurit in SosthuPanisP naPeO what has FoPe to be called transhumanism Many cybertheorists and organizations such as Humanity formerly the World Transhumanist Organization which attempt to think transhumanist futurity such

chimera and the offspring that has no parents because its qualities do not conform to or obey the rules of the humanist discourse morally logically religiously phallocentrically reproductively Those who were the aberrations of society are now those the human seek to become The Haraway posthuman is a means to substantiate and anthropomorphise the technological other into something that can be embraced and embrace back in light of the building out of skill which characterizes technological development The resulting loss of consent which occurs only serves to highlight the incompleteness of our bodies  posthumanism places achieving our full humanity or full embodied awareness as conditional to our ability to understand our own inforPation the data that defines us  inforPation that Fan

transcendent intent not Spinozas conscious version of appetite is retrospective  the regulation of already established technologies  and antagonistic to Lyotards suggestion of an ethical time Fukayama like many posttheories reduces the future to the way the present deals with technologies already established  technically then the past  as directly and causally necessary as our only possible unfurling destiny Lyotard states obligation is not conditional but categorical nor does it condition Even when taken as an effect of pure will it cannot in turn be the cause of an effect of Posthuman Ethics an act for example which would result from it Causality through freedom is immediate that is without mediation but also without recurrence  it will be said You ought to awaits a sequel whether it is obedience or not and thus sketches out something possible to come or a future But this is also the case for many phrases of other regimens  for instance for cognitive phrases subjected to the procedure for establishing reality 1988 126 Post theorys manipulation of and confusion over time grapples with this way of thinking the future beyond prescription Dawne McCance explains The Differend deals with the problem of writing or speaking after that is without an JiYen ruOes   7iPe is an iPPanent now and the obOiJation to reÀeFtion about which one can never speak and the authenticity of which one cannot verify though speak and verify one must nonetheless do The event is not the axis but the definition of sSeeFh and YerifiFation PetaPorShose µ2ur 3osthuPan uture is somewhat anathema In posthuman theory we do have an obligation but it is never what we think it is because the ethical event cannot be known in advance Similarly we are not aware of what we are capable of Lyotards I am able to in reference to the obligationcapability event but Lyotard emphasizes pure ethical time obliges and enables one within the event of obligation  a singular and unique event  each in their own way This beautifully simple pure ethics of exceptional moment of the this one obligation as acknowledgement of and creativity toward connection coalesces will with ability thus refuting the idea of human will as coming from a consistent idea of humanness and subjectivity and obligation with condition which seems particularly apt in the posthuman terrain where we do not et know of what we are FaSabOe in sSeFifiF referenFe to the was in whiFh we emerge with and as technologies of unpredictable futures However and here is both Lyotards profound posthuman intervention and the premise of Posthuman Ethics this is already the case Each entity is already that will based on precise ability which cannot be transferred to another entity and which is never clear to the entity itself until the moment of the event of obligation which in turn has never before been witnessed or required The most primitive or ordinary bodies operate in ethical time as a time never been before which is a postmodern if not posthuman apprehension of duration as rupture over chronology Our anxieties about post theory come from their rapturous effect so more than displacements perhaps they are reminders of all the bodies and abilities of entities which the enlightenment transcendental essence and modernity have needed to repress in order to maintain the integrity of the phantasy of their completion a future which has not yet but will arrive Posthuman will after Lyotard is that which deestablishes the human as a site both of a certain reality and the way the concept of the human has been privileged in constituting all reality at the expense of those who do not count as human Ethical time resonates with post theories confusion but confusion creates a consistency of ethical creativity and surprise as accountable demand that is not reduced to right or wrong response correct operation of the awaited sequel obedience or disobedience or lament at non Posthuman Ethics foreclosure or resolution We do not know what will happen and how we will respond If posthuman theory has seen this as both a celebration and an anxiety then via Lyotards ethical time our celebration may be of incommensurabilities of entities including the incommensurability of an entity as to how it perceives itseOf as ÀourishinJ MubiOant diYersifinJ SotentiaOit and aniet as a hoSe for the best possible force and consequence of creating new openings which allow obligation events that access entities beyond their agreement with categories of the human Put simply if as Fukuyama suggests posthumanism is embraced as a power of human freedom 217 then we must ask what happens if we were not Founted as huPan in the first SOaFe In one sense Fukuyamas argument could not be further from posttheory His FonfiJuration of the bioteFhnoOoJiFaO huPan sees JoinJ beond the huPan as a huPan riJht huPan PodifiFation as an iPSeratiYe of beinJ an obedient suffiFient normal human and humans as inherently free thus freedom should focus on further freedom found in extension of capabilities and life Where Fukuyamas theories are post is that the only thing humans should be thinking about is how to not be mortal humans any longer by being eternal organisms In stating humans are nothing more than the freedom of force to shape what they are as a preordained template rather than Spinozas nonconscious preservation as essence his

subjectivity and those who know best beinJ those who define that subMeFtiYit its OiPits and deYeOoSPent Where Lyotard asks to what end Miccoli suggests the more obvious critical posthuman answer would be to achieve full embodied awareness Miccoli 75 Miccolis argument is committed to an ethics of rights and his concept of bodily awareness is not transcendental humanism which happens to be trapped in or limited by a body Rather for him corporeality is simple and evident in that it is all we are and the very site where what we are is contested in brutal oppressive ways Full embodied awareness is absolutely present in Fukuyamas dream but as antagonistic to that dream  we must become posthuman so we can forget that aOO we are is Àesh that bodies Fan feeO FoOd Sain hunJer sufferinJ and uOtiPateO cease us to be Miccolis bodily awareness is not what a human body is but that it is and thus other humans have bodies which express and which affect each other Their essential qualities and nature do not make up bodily awareness but the devastatingly simple fact that we should be aware we are bodies is integral to thinking rights be they human or not Lyotards differend embodies the body Posthuman Ethics that cannot speak in the language of the master thus cannot be legitimized as a body If that body speaks in the masters language it concedes to the master ideology Fukuyama places the use of biotechnology in the hands of the state The minoritarian has no viable body in the eyes of the state Postmodernism demands multivocal languages be legitimized and far from making sure these many vocalities are heard it accepts understanding leads to legitimation through assimilation so the best we can do is our ethical best to negotiate for Lyotard through gaming multiplicity premised on misunderstanding as creativity between vocalities In terms of sharing humans share nothing beyond what they can hazard they might share which in decidedly posthuman ways they also share with elements and lives outside of what is considered human In this sense the posthuman is ethical because it sees the human category as a purpose rather than a thing and far from wanting to count as human posthuman ethics seeks to count everything in spite of and in order to liberate life from not the human or humanity but the effects of constituting manipulating and continuing the category taxonomy and genealogy of the human The central question what is the posthuman does not ask what it is We need a new verb as yet unthought The posthuman is everything that is not human but it is also a reason the posthuman is a motive a need an opening movement On Affirmative Vitalism Posthuman Ethics Shrases Pan of its suJJestions traFinJ first a Sath aOonJ a negative trajectory or the trajectory of not

indicator of what is at stake how it has been constructed and why  leading to the ethics of why not not as a question but as the reason for ethics For each trajectory of not I have attempted to forge in the following chapters a potential thought Ideally the not would have a notnot suggestion but the necrophilosophy of some deconstructive not is a lamentation at turns indulgent or over emphasizing the intervention of sovereign power and the impossibility of ethics within that power beyond a reconstitution of the other through a new overvaluation of the I that mourns its incapacity to act but which attempts to do so nonetheless Impossibility is a key element of Posthuman Ethics but one whiFh resuOts in iPaJination and FreatiYit where µsuffiFient enouJh address isnt enough visàvis Levinas

not knowing what will be on the other side but knowing there is a reason to extend ones own side and remap the cartography of n dimensional nonEuclidean rhizomes Posthuman Ethics follows a theoretical trajectory which is mediative of but in other ways particular to new assemblages of ethical encounters with bodies and entities Immediately when one thinks ethics in a post world based on Continental philosophy Levinas is foregrounded For reasons elaborated below Levinas will not be utilized in Posthuman Ethics But this book will also heavily FritiTue other faYoured ShiOosoShers in order not to refute their inÀuentiaO and iPSortant Fontribution to the oeuYre but to offer a different FonfiJuration of ways in which certain assemblages and interpretations of ethics can liberate the alreadynothuman from the traps of human perception whether that perception is deliberate or incidental I am not suggesting this can be done and in some messianic way I am the one to do it Certain philosophers are more adamant in their attempts to challenge the inevitable operation of human perception especially those philosophers who are not afraid of giving up perception altogether without giving up interaction and mediation Just as Lyotards ethical time knows it can neither suFFeed nor faiO et Pust be eeFuted the tiPe of P FonfiJuration of philosophers and bodies is one which cannot predict its success and it is the very frightening imperative that is the reason for ethics itself Posthuman Ethics shows we cannot do ethics and evaluate whether something was as ethical or not as we would hope Perhaps this is why certain parts of the book may even seem mystical6 due to their abstraction which takes the posthuman like the ecstatic outside of time into a place of encounter with the imperceptible but materially affective outside Perhaps also this is why the book will be guilty of what Carey Wolfe states of That paradoxical observability of the unobservable the communicability of the incommunicable  which ought to sound familiar to students of romanticism xxxii Enter Foucault the romantic A manifest truth writes Foucault 6 Mystical is delivered in Posthuman Ethics from its

will attempt to express mysticism as a secular cosmic force Posthuman Ethics but when one begins to detect the very conditions that made it seem manifest the familiarities that served as its support the darknesses that bought about its clarity and all those far away things that secretly sustained it and made it go without saying 1994 447 Foucaults claim balances the wonder of the Romantic imperceptible embracing Outside with the required acknowledgement that the way reality is constituted and b whoP is a Àawed resuOt of reJiPes of Sower and PasTuerades of obserYabOe exteriority Wolfe tends toward Jacques Derrida Judith Butler Bruno Latour and what could be argued a more American theoretical framework Wolfe in his discussion of the place of ethics in posthuman theory explores the status of biotechnology and media in the United States now and this direct application is itself an ethical turn in its material encounter with issues of obligation neither judgemental as I perhaps am nor unconditionally celebratory Many other posthuman theorists tend toward Levinas Derrida Latour Haraway and Hayles while interestingly those theorists who are more aligned with my framework such as Rosi Braidotti Anna HickeyMoody Elizabeth Grosz Claire Colebrook and Felicity Colman seem to shy away from posthuman theory or are more critical of it7 emphasizing French feminism and the Nietzschian Bergsonian Spinozist and DeleizioGuattarian line Posthuman Ethics as a FoPPitted work on Àesh and embodiment as a prime site of contestation in a posthuman world does not resoOYe the disSarate tendenFies but does take a Yer sSeFifiF interSretation of the posthuman  those who were already not quite human  and argues it is these bodies which are the matter of another way to think posthumanism In reference to the Romantic turn in posthumanism once again time emerges as an issue and the time and geography of various movements create their own SroduFtiYe ruStures and fissures nne einstones Avatar Bodies 2004 is one of the many posthuman texts which exploits the mobility of the concept to bring in seemingly unrelatable elements  here ancient Eastern ideology or theology  to create what she calls an esoteric and exoteric spiritual posthumanism It does not resound with Orientalist fetishism but acknowledges and delights in its development of proximities of ideas that may be considered with less sympathy by those who wish to maintain a semblance of discursive discretion Romanticism does share consistencies with posthuman theory especially via Foucault Deleuze and Guattari Bataille and other key theorists for Posthuman Ethics but chronology has been perverted so this cannot be a criticism Mysticism esoteric and other philosophical blasphemies populate Posthuman Ethics but like avatar bodies it is hoped it will be no less philosophical for doing so Returning to the question of why not Levinas Weinstone calls him the philosopher of no contact par 7 Coincidence or epistemic training may be to blame but these as myself are all Australian feminist theorists For more on this phenomenon see MacCormack Patricia 2009 Feminist Becomings Hybrid Feminism and Haecceitic Reproduction Posthuman Ethics excellence 153 Evoking the transhuman Barry Rutland 2004 suggests the postmodern ethical subject is a transject Yet as Levinas he remains committed to the ethical as responsorial based on the address of the obligation as a demand coming from the face As privileged plane of subjectivity even and increasingly in posthuman theory animal subjectivity the face makes an ethics based on difference incommensurability and imperceptibility impossible Simultaneous with the issue of time Levinas work raises the issue of space Posthuman ethics is a negotiation of distance in the ways relation is structured or destructured If an entity can face another entity it can perceive that entity as not it not part of it and so constituted as perceived by it Levinasian ethics offer many features of postmodern philosophys readdressing of encounters with alterity His claim that transcendence comes from the encounter being based on the fact one can SerFeiYe another without noPenFOature of the other  that the other is suffiFient enough to count by virtue of being recalls a kind of almost phenomenological differend eYinas defies ethiFs based on eTuiYaOenFe and FonYersion is refusaO of FhronoFentriF FausaOit in the µfaFe of the iPPanent infinite at the encounter of the other is an ethics of time and certainly verges on mysticism as Posthuman Ethics does 7he Pain reason eYinas Fannot be Mustified as inteJraO to posthuman ethics is what or whom he considers as counting The very question of whatwho counts or more precisely never asking for the what or who is what underpins this book Whether one validates Levinas counting other or negotiates it to further inFOude others that Pa Fount this is stiOO a nuanFed and refined but nonetheless exclusory ethics of external other even while one loses subjectivity by placing the self in the position of the other 141 It would be ridiculous to write Levinas off and I do not do so but there are ways in which his work diverges from ethical posthuman encounters I would not claim any of those theorists who do inspire Posthuman Ethics would be any better should they be interrogated in reference to for example difference feminism or abolitionist animal rights but theory is for post theory what one makes of it and doing theory is creating theor in SosthuPanisP where Àesh and thouJht aFtiYisP and ShiOosoSh are not bifurcated For this reason Continental philosophy corporeal feminism and ecosophical experimentation refutes Baxis understandable anxiety that Theory remains a suspect term for many social movement and activist folk IX She defines theor as a µtask of anaOsis  diYided into SroduFers and FonsuPers This creates a false diachrony between theorypractice or theoristsactivists Baxi arJues

theoryactivism by the perilous but compelling task to act with theory and theorize with activism Again we return to the system of relations which is reoriented in DeleuzianSpinozan ethics Deleuze explicates Spinozan ethics through the concept of common notions In short a common notion is the representation of a composition between two or more bodies and a unity of this composition  For when we encounter a body Posthuman Ethics that agrees with ours we experience an affect or feeling of joypassion although we do not adequately know what it has in common with us 1988b 55 56 If affects are the becoming inhuman of man Deleuze and Guattari 1994 169 then man must pass through inhumanity toward ethics Crucial to Deleuzes definition of ethiFs borne of FoPPon notions is that eaFh eOePent or entit does not FoPe to the reOation aOread fied in their TuaOities whiFh wiOO therefore either be or not be clearly commensurable with the other Deleuze emphasizes that a defininJ eOePent of the eSerienFinJ

is also present in ethics these two passions are the wonders of ethics in its nondismembered consistency A number of constellations initialize this emergence There is anxiety in forsakinJ SriYiOeJed Sositions and anneations to reOiabOe siJnifiFations but there is also anxiety in jubilance trepidation in liberty and in the cliché of fear of the unknown the fear is as exhilarating and creative as the jubilance is frightening by facilitating an encounter with a beyond Jubilant may sound idealistic and redemptive anxiety a kind of capital hysteria The passions and affects of ethics Posthuman Ethics are extensive rather than leap to overcome them we reel in that we thought we should avoid because especially for the oppressed other there is no luxurious avoidance of diminishing affects The aim is aimless the act matters and the matter of the ethics Oterit and oSenness reOinTuishinJ reOianFe on Sreeistent siJnifiers to beFoPe Oost in the Àows of affeFtiYit are essentiaO to ethiFaO

mobile affectivity of forces which interact as a mediation of desire and where passion and joy come from the notknowable of self or other Yet it is problematic to offer this constitution of ethics as an exploratory future without a social contextualization of the effects of powers of discourse on others in history Just as good ethics seeks to enhance joy and passions so bad ethics emphasizes those affects which exhaust or enclose the other exacerbating their capacity to eSress n terPs of reÀeFtions on sSeFifiF entities whose FaSaFit to effeFt haYe been oppressed through signifying systems the

Tattooings capacity to make philosophy readdress issues of bodies as intensity and momentum is where its contestation of sites of power is oriented Deleuze and Guattari claim Paintings tattoos or

tattooing Yet tattooing itself is as complex as any other form of creativity in that motivation is not clear The question could be turned from Why does one tattoo ones body to Why do we want to know why we or another tattoos Lyotard states To ask someone a question is to presuppose that the person understands it and wants to reply  do we ask this question about ourselves Or else they will not

think the body temporally through an act that is most frequently described as a permanent marking of the skin Even if we see a tattooed body as an affective body it is taken traditionally as a spatial phenomenon  ie the same body affecting other bodies not a body able to affect and recreate itself But Bergson states If it is a question of movement all the intelligence retains is a series of

tattooists needle is perhaps best described as elucidating nuanced versus gross material expression rather than natural versus cultural skin Either way skin is encountered as legible Power could be seen as the interface between the discourses of society and selfexpressed subjective inscription  from gender to race to body PodifiFation 7he skin is where the seOf enters the worOd and the worOd

thermoception or where the world is unmade in nociception It is also the surface upon which most forms of prejudice and terror are performed Skin is where tattoos appear but also where meaning is read

Perhaps one could say while Deleuze and Guattari ask how do we make ourselves a Body without Organs particularly in the chapter Economy of this Writing Lyotards Libidinal Economy asks how do we make philosophy a BwO In this chapter I have attempted to show both that tattooing is a radicalizing of the skin and the skin itself is a point where philosophy and our relationship with the world can be radicalized in reference to difference especially gender Tattooing incites provokes hopefully in a way that further multiplies differenFes between and within bodies f this is so then the

8 that tattoos are now equivalent to clothes because they can be removed by laser is misguided Economically laser removal is far more expensive than being tattooed and the large expense of tattoos themselves is seen as disproportionate with their cultural value in spite of their being akin to art over clothes Laser removal is intensely painful and frequently leaves severe raised scars in the form of keloids Tattooed skin belongs to a more surgical more visceral and I would argue after Hardt and Negri more contested interface with the world than do clothes Optimistically I would suggest that because traditional forces are reactive to the affect of tattooing tattooing represents a form of active force This activity comes from the bodys reaction to cultural restrictions in reference to what a body can mean before it restricts what a body can do Ones own relationship to ones tattoos is as complex as the relationship of the nontattooed to tattooinJ 7he Podified bod howeYer shouOd not

art come from silences and the tenebrous illumination that discloses the planes which art unfurls to deliver us from our humanness toward pursuits of altered perception Batailles poem We Can Speak of

toward whiFh the transFendentaO huPan asSires in the creation and appreciation of art We can speak of paths takenWhere humanity stubbornly persistsIn pursuit of vanished lightWhich enlightens us

seek to reÀeFt a reaOit in a Pore SreFise or reduced way Art attends to creating from chaos but the result is the opposite of the mapping of this chaos by determined coordinates  Deleuze and Guattari rethink science philosophy and art as always including an I do not know that is positive and creative the condition of creation itself and that consists in determining by what one does not know 1994 128 This chapter will discuss ways in which the artperceiver encounter may be rethought Persistent questions of structuralism and poststructural theory  what are ways of seeing ways of reading ways of listening  in posthuman ethics show there are no ways But poststructuralisms questions do not become defunct Insofar as posthumanism shows the very questions themselves demand answers the polyvocality the questions presume is inherent in posthumans multiplicities and proliferative affects The death of the authorartist and the ensuing death of the reader can lead to a nonnihilistic vitalism that maintains an ethical nonsubject Arts capacity for fabulation and expression impossible in and not identically transferable to the real world is why we love art and why it is and makes inhumanness or what I will in this chapter call ahumanity huPanit differs froP the SosthuPan or is a Pore sSeFifiF forP of SosthuPan relation in that it takes as its catalyst the very amorphous obviously problematic but for theorists of both poststructuralism and transcendent attainment of human SerfeFtion a tSe of Patter FonfiJured in a uniTue wa b what is residuaOO FaOOed the human By this I mean and each of the following words could be placed in quote marks to illustrate their tentative use things created by human organisms Posthuman Ethics that are intended to be something formed by and external to the human that then attempt to return to an involution with the human to alter their being with a hope to depending on which theoretical trajectory one follows variously ignite becomings and encounters with the outside or quicken the base human organism toward a more perfected cultural phenomenon to selfrealization to God and so forth The inhuman is the version of the posthuman created by an encounter with a plane of matter formed of human thought converted to a nonliving thing whatever thingness may mean within disparate philosophies Even though nonliving the art has µOife throuJh its eSressiYit uniTue with eaFh affeFtiYe infinitesiPaO PoPent of relation It becomes clear that in the context of certain art theory which aspires to catalyse becominginhuman that the very category and premise of what it means to call something art is dubious All art is viable to the extent that it is more or less affective to each immanent moment of each art acolyte Perhaps inevitably in a posthuman context art will develop a term to refer to its own life very differently I would very much seek and welcome a new kind of terminology to refer to what we think as art but for now because there is no vocabulary of and for arts thingness in a posthuman context and to develop one reducibly would be anathema to the very problem all that can be offered in the context of Posthuman Ethics is that humans can create things through recombining matter that are independent of epistemes which support the valuation of use based on production as reproduction Art is for capitalism useless when it makes us inhuman but useful in posthuman ethical thouJht 7o define what art is is a frustratinJO iPSossibOe task but worth for ethiFaO theory Yet it is something and this chapter by describing these silent invisible encounters will coalesce the I do not know what art is with the not knowing art creates inhuman ecstasies The inhuman is created through arts inhumanity Art is however different to the creativity of events which are constituted through the subsequent posthuman encounters in this book The following chapters on nonhuman animals congenital and other nonself stylized monsters desire as inherent to though not exclusively the human organism and the irrefutability of death are all what could be termed natural combinations of matter with which humans have an ambiguous inevitable relation Arts is less natural in degree in that its inevitability in the world is a diminished one in comparison to others due to it being after the human creator This makes no claims to authorship intent or expected affect Just that art could be described as something that was not there in a particular combination before a human manipulated it but crucially it was a non OiYinJ set of PateriaOs infiniteO different froP nonFonsensuaO orJanisPs suFh as animal intervened with the cured monster or the making dead of lives We do not know what art is but its role within a posthuman ethical relation gives it its thingness without being an external representing object Rancière emphasizes that art is no longer representative in two ways The first is that froP an ethiFaO SersSeFtiYe in FataOinJ our SosthuPan beFoPinJs art should represent what is unrepresentable bearing witness to the unspeakable that is in excess of language and to which conversion to language refuses bearing witness by inserting unspeakable art into a register or lexicon that by virtue of this Art Inhuman Ecstasy inclusion imagines all art represents and all unspeakable acts are representable thereby they cannot be described as inhuman When initially Rancière orients inhuman art around the forsaking of the Other that dehumanizes and therefore demands representation in order to verify the need to bear witness a doubling occurs which shows that inhuman art comes from the dehumanization of subjects and this inhumanity is necessary in order for certain lives to not be excluded The lesson we learn from inhuman art  the art of the unrepresentable and unspeakable  is that maintaining human perception coming from human subjectivity is unethical Those who cannot be converted to description and representation are excluded Rather than selecting equality as a raising up of the Other to representability Rancière after Lyotard claims arts responsibility is to resist the human perception that creates unspeakable acts These are the two heterogeneous logics which overlap An intrinsic logic of the possibilities of the possibilities and iPSossibiOities sSeFifiF to a reJiPe of art and an ethiFaO denunFiation of the Yer ShenoPenon of reSresentation 5anFiqre  11  7he definition of ethiFaO art is the obligation to present the unrepresentable to catalyse thought impossible for the human subject to recognize make sense of and master The onus is neither on the artwork nor the mythologized intent of the artist but the subjects witnesss coming toward or path taken For this reason this chapter will explicitly aYoid referenFinJ sSeFifiF works of art and further what Fonstitute an artistiF Jenre hiOe Post iPPediateO art is assoFiated with fine art Oiterature PusiF and so forth it can also include bodies movements and experiences considered ordinary in ones day Deleuze and Guattari state of two forms of oil painting The distinction clearly does not come down to representational or not since no art and no sensation haYe eYer been reSresentationaO n the first Fase sensation is realized in the material and does not exist outside its realization 1994 193 In this sense each event of art from its genre to material object status is no more than the singular encounter that realizes it Anything which elicits an inevitable rupture of consistencies of perception can in this formulation be referred to as art The rupture is limited only to the extent that it catches us up in a moment which is I will argue not a dialectic but an ecstatic event Desire for art is an ethical tactic of apprehension Ethics demands an address to relations of difference which will necessarily dismantle and reform the subject and thus desire for art is ethical to the extent that the perceiver mobilises subjective transformation In thinking the inhuman encounter with art key topics are challenged the neJotiation of desFriStiYe and reÀeFtiYe sSeeFh whiFh Fonstitutes SossibiOities of ways of

in ethics that we need art The Inner Inhuman This chapter utilizes terms such as catalyst and work to describe the art object which creates the event as the encounter with the outside The outside after Maurice Blanchot and Foucault no longer sees counting as human as crucial or ethical in perceiving art The outside involves the disintegration of the I who speaks in speaking about The I speak belongs to a sovereign language The speaker that dissolves in art in Foucaults description literature proliferates language language getting as far away from itself as possible  leading us by way of other paths to the outside in which the speaking subject disappears 1987 12 13 Art need not resonate with the human world to succeed The ahuman planes into which art launches us are outside we bear

correctly how is it with us How can we think the theatre of the artevent without the signifying structure Serres offers veils as a mode of perceiving relations against empty and emptying structures A veil has qualities which both conceal and reveal It pleats manifests and obscures many folds and folds the participants who themselves pleat with the structure and each other and themselves as othered while in inextricable and univocal emergence with each other Here are at least four preliminary pleats2 which of course are n pleats Even if the veil is one blanket which covers the secret relation between self and workelementother it lacks the hard corners and JeoPetriFaO rationaOiation of the struFture t is defined b Fontours and tetures adjectives not the noun which is populated by other nouns of which the self and other are just two more Crucially the veil is not removable It is also not fused The veil is the condition of possibility of the beneath which is in turn what creates the veils tantalizing offer It must be understood as both separate and incapable of being removed It holds no promise of revelation of the relation While traditional encounters with art offer the theatre of revelation of meaning as a promise for repetition the veiled relation does not offer those beneath perception of sensations and affects The theatre of the art encounters players are binarised The perceiver and its other risk becoming equivalent to any other biunivocal subject dialectic beginning with active interpreter and passive work The compulsion to remove the veil to reveal the relation

this marvelous sounding soul resonate with art encounters Serres explains the soul is knotted like the world and like the world it is unstable  2000 120 He explores the burden of being a subject or

literature cinema dreams and other forms of art all of course liberated from their genre are examples through which we can explore the outside element because they are at once unresponsive and

121 we acknowledge that as unresponsive questions do not cannot demand answers However against privileging new codes of representation new codes of apprehension formulate an ahuman ethics of experiencing art The material external nature of art can be encountered willfully while the molecular and despotic elements of art resonate with the turbulent vibrating of the desire potentialized

from the order of love the ecstasy of existence is a summation made possible by the contingency of the other  in fact it is an art of love 2000 29 Can we conceive love of art as an art of love I describe the relation of perceiver and art to one which elicits ecstasy I do so for two reasons 7he first reason is as unresSonsiYe art is not FonFeiYabOe as oppositionally related human but it is not without life per se and so the art encounter is essentially a solitary event or at least what Bataille calls an inner event When knowledge is diminished lived experience begins and the possible emerges the possible in a realm which appeared foreign to intelligence that of inner experience  1988 8 In inner experience when the self attains in the end the fusion of object and subject being as subject nonknowledge as object the unknown Bataille 1988 9 which no longer recognizes differences between the intellectual aesthetic and moral the inner of the self belongs also to outside Being inner within outside fuses not only subject and object but time and space deliverance toward ecstasy The second reason is ecstasy does not privilege any particular kind of affect It is not pleasurable aesthetic as evaluation of worth We thus come back to a conclusion to which art led us The struggle with chaos is only the instrument of a more profound struggle against opinion for the misfortune of people comes from opinion Deleuze and Guattari 1994 206 Nor is it the aesthetic of violence which theory has sought in art both in representation and perception in order to Posthuman Ethics constitute revolutionary art3 Ecstasy has no describable quality just as we cannot desFribe the finite Fontent of art Fstas found in eSerienFinJ art is a FoPPon documented symptom of the pleasurable pain encountered with works that take us outside seen in the Stendhal Syndrome4 for example In ecstatic art encounters the work is available incidentally accidentally volitionally for all selves as offerinJ affeFtiYe SotentiaOiation to aOO subMeFts  there are no OiPits or sSeFifiF requirements for subjects to open as each opens uniquely as a singularity based on the sSeFifiFit of their TuaOities

absence of light or of sound but absorption into the outside 1988 17 For Bataille ecstasy is found in the leaving behind of objects the lament which is lost when the subject and object are simultaneously dissolved and the self is alienated from self This comes through a giving away of knowledge as anchoring the dialectic of self and nonself presence and revelation so that the others shifts from an other to the outside itseOf µ Fan SroYide it with neither a MustifiFation nor an end I remain in intolerable nonknowledge which has no other way out than ecstasy itself 1988 12 Bataille seems adamant ecstasy comes as agony mourning and painful failure of self It comes as slip seeking experience as an event to be souJht and FontePSOated ut in YoOuPinous eFstas reÀeFtion is iPSossibOe This is the Stendhal moment or Augustines lament that late have I loved thee Lord evincing presence independent from time as the now that cannot be accessed even while it is constitutive of the ecstatic self In address to time this could be called atemporality where the resonances of present past and future which while retaining their own qualities can be tactically perceived as simultaneous This also hurts For the art lover want for a future experience or the work already sees the want FoPe froP a sinJuOar eSerienFe that has inÀaPed the SossibiOit of new desire So the desire toward a future relation comes from something already been but that was not expected The self disappears at this point But of course neither the self nor the works cease to be sensed and sensible FstatiF AfÀiFtiRn The other of the art encounter is an intensityplane not a person or a singularly apprehensible piece of art or predesired scripted act of reading listening touching 3 In his interview with Kristeva Rainer Ganahl critiques the emphasis in art as an act of revolt on destruction as death He points out this tactic employs either a literal or metaphoric strategy both of which relocate themselves in established codes of representation even though content disrupts In Kristeva 2002 4 This syndrome the proper name of which is hyperkulturemia comes from 6tendhaOs eSerienFe of faintinJ

that produces a vague choice for the self to open to an indeterminate revolutionary alterity of selfother element whereby art encountering is an opening up to the outside or to nomenclature and dampen down the inherent subversive experience to reform the self much as discursive regulation and institutions including those which prescribe correct and incorrect readings and interpretations reform the selfconstellation into the human Pain is there the pain is the decisive intensity Forsaking humanity hurts because it both slaughters any sense of hermeneutic subjectivity and the rights counting as human affords The more majoritarian one is the more it hurts The ethics of the artencounter shows becoming ahuman is viable and necessary for new ways of thinking alterity in the realities of life for oppressed sub human subjects Clearly this has always been the case for those unable to control patterns of human signifying systems from sexual racial and diffabled others to other forms of life and the ecological interactions which sustain them beyond human manipulation ffaFePent and etenuation take the seOfwork inÀeFtion outside of diaOeFtiFs and discourse The future of the self needs

recognized lost when it was the work is achingly nonpresent to the self for capture and consumption yet it remains within the self and the self within the work The unique entity created between and as

atroShied reified as eFstatiF or overwhelmed to the point of the breaking of the Body without Organs we may risk if we take our experiment too far and stretch our tensor too tight The ecstatics joy when the state alters its distribution is one that welcomes the new pain In her memoirs perhaps the most famous ecstatic Teresa of Avila tells us when this pain of which I am now speaking begins the Lord seems to transport the soul and throw it into an ecstasy 211 Ecstatic being refuses the folding which Posthuman Ethics constitute subjectivisation Instead it experiences self as wonder inextricable from experience which experiences nothing recognisable or perceptible beyond indescribable state of encounter with the outside The event resonates with our encounter with the event of the

transport of the soul5 which is the state or condition of the being which is Blanchots being without end and being without thought yet it does not mean transportation in space or through time The souls transport is one of various relations with the outside which is always the same relation Just as thought is unthought pain and joy are neither and both The temporalization of pain as experience involves the pain being either on or off waiting for the pain and watching it recede so living in a state of what next or when Where Bataille sees the encounter with non knowledge as death or rather death as the cure for nonknowledge Bataille 1988 111 the ecstatics nonknowledge does not presume that that which will be known or that which is lost as knowable before it arrives  including the selfs

art encounter beyond the evanescent blind silent everything As Marsden points out the fact that the blinding and abasement of self should yield both insight and beatitude is one of the enduring enigmas of mystical experience It is precisely through the abdication of knowledge through the liquidation of its conditions of possibility that divinity is touched Marsden 2002 129 Differentiating ecstasy from a more obvious form of self suffering such as masochism to describe abasement as masochistic emphasizes the value of what is lost Blindness of self through art encounters is not the

1993a 767 While they are a catalyst they are neither extricated nor invasive but irrefutably dissipated within he and the protagonist is dissipated within them The catalyst is the event of encounter  the art event not the witness forming the contractual demand These entities are liberated from this limited option of emergence as dead or alive apart or as coming from within when the protagonist comprehends the option itself demands speech within a frame that gives the dead a before presence and no future hence absented loss of them only for he who sSeaks theP or OanFhot sSeeFh is aOso

Primarily it perhaps perversely gives the others as artworks their own mode of perception where traditional encounters with art denies the art catalyst facilitator all existence beyond a phantasized identity of clear meaning usually via the artist ut the other as unresSonsiYe inorJaniF works SerFeStion is not there to affirP the self so it is not a perceived perception It is imagined as

voluminous familiarcircle And it is ethical because the self that Art Inhuman Ecstasy is lost must trust the other as perceiving in this same aperceptive way I am here but not here because there is no

through surrogates in opposition to Blanchots protagonists encounter The life to come is the life which cannot be unique because it is a repetition of the life gone Temporal extension is inherent but the occupants of each time are the same and demand of their progeny they also be the same Existence is solitary and singular between entities of past and future The protagonists encounter is teeming and allpresent without phantasy or perception Orpheus desires sexual union with the Eurydice he reveals What makes art encounters interesting is that to an extent they premise themselves on solitary experience The reproducer and the act of sexual union need another that is isomorphically made appropriately correspondent to the self Bataille amusingly reminds us however that the solitary little theatre is always in operation like a daydream lived out in intercourse 2001 107 The artist may produce but not progeny reproducing the artist The art witness recognizes nothing in the encounter with and as the everything that art opens being both the opening and the open Unlike the voracious lover who seeks an object upon which to alight the art objects love demands a kind of inattention which also acknowledges the desperate and hurtful truth that the one that is the other in proximity within and extricated froP the subMeFt the work the intensifier is inattentiYe OanFhot deParFates two

Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition This chapter attempts a project which creates an impasse even though it remains antagonistic to sovereign operations of representation or the very thought of the other It is one which posits a somewhat utopian scheme that may verge in its aspirations on unworkable within the frames of knowledge within which we operate It addresses animals or correctly nonhuman animals which will hitherto be referred to as nonhumans This is why it is a posthuman project Human apprehension and comprehension cannot limit nonhumans within an ethical relation What this chapter seeks is an absolute abolitionist stance on all interaction with  conceptually and actually  any nonhuman Radical animal rights is increasingly becoming fed up with thinking the animal even through antispeciesist philosophy as it elucidates the luxuriant arguments in which humans indulge in the name of the rights of them and us based on qualities of each or critiquing the qualities ascribed to each yet remaining within a realm that speaks of thus speaks for and ultimately speaks with human language Maintaining speech within the limits human language compels is the crux of all argument It implies a shared language Further from the repudiation of animal rights based on equivalence which antispeciesism has foregrounded in order to create an ethics of the inevitable shared living with nonhumans only the human can and needs to be deconstructed and the humans trajectories toward posthumanism have nothing to do with other life If this were the technique of posthumanism it would simply constitute a reverse of dragging nonhumans up to human level to be viable Any thinking of nonhuman entities in posthuman theory a clear trend in current posthuman publications fails the very premise of its ambition no matter how amorphous or experimental Thinking the nonhuman in posthuman ethics should indeed can only concern itself with the human and its decentred and delimited futures in order to create hope in reference to inevitable perhaps unfortunate not for humans often for nonhumans encounters with nonhumans This may sound nihilistic and certain responses are presumed  of course animals enjoy interactions with humans or we can help as much as hurt animal systems can teach us how to be posthuman or the most basic question we need to think differently about animals No we need to think about the undoing of us whatever that means From the irrefutably important work done by animal rights philosophers and activists unfortunate in its necessity seeking equality thinking needs to go further enough to accept thought itself as inherently unethical in reference to the nonhuman The simplest Posthuman Ethics premise of my perhaps contentious argument on the humans posthuman future visàvis the nonhuman comes from Serres devastatingly hopeful and demanding concept of grace whoever is nothing whoever has nothing passes and steps aside From a bit of force from any force from anything from any decision from any determination  Grace is nothing it is nothing but stepping aside Not to touch the ground with ones force not to leave any trace of ones weight to leave no mark to leave nothing to yield to step aside  to dance is only to make room to think is only to step aside and make room give up ones place 1995 47 Serres discussing dance as philosophy and philosophy as a dance elaborates that dance negotiates nakedness the unwritten tablet the absent man We can then speak of philosophys liberation from situatedness no matter how multiple or mobile to dance where seeking nothingness is antithetical to nihilistic nothingness rather a means by which we can become capable of anything and that very capacity results in the freedom of real responsibility far from the freedom to do what we can as dominant humans to allow the nonhuman to be Language is a power shared dissymmetrically with more or less weight between humans There is no shared language between humans and nonhumans Any sympathetic argument about what interactions we may have or share with nonhumans is always limited by our thinking the encounter even via abstracted language thoughts from outside which delimit language Many sympathetic to the wonder of encounters with nonhumans elevate these encounters to some kind of mystical experience because they demand another kind of thinking of the encounter itself But still the experience is human Claiming nonhuman encounters emphasize the animality of the human or the enchantments of incommensurable nonetheless available in relation with something that allows us to access the elements of us that escape the human which society culture language thought deny us are all human claims There is no deliverance from the human found in the nonhuman The division must remain for the very premise to be valid We are in a seeming impossible bind In Death of the Animal Paola Cavalieri incepts the basic premise of posthuman antispeciesism The notion of animality seems to have been created just to serve the metaphysics of the primacy of human beings Cavalieri 3 What Peter Singer calls second wave animal rights continues the same questions which place onus on nonhumans  do they thinksufferhave intelligence and therefore should we test an insipid prettied vernacular for torture eat essentially exocannibalism slaughter correctly murder and use for products such as milk and eggs enslave In Defense of Animals The Second Wave includes chapters on vivisection and speciesism in the laboratory farming reform the science of suffering criticism of zoos and advice for effective activism Noble and necessary though these arguments are they never rise from discursive games between humans about animals Abolitionist Gary Francoine points out Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition the smarts game is one that nonhuman animals can never win  The smarts game is just that  a game It is yet another reason not to accord animals moral siJnifiFanFe toda in faYor of Pore siOO and harPfuO researFh to deterPine whether animals can solve human math puzzles and perform other tasks that have no moral relevance We already know everything we need to know to come to the conclusion that we cannot justify eating wearing or using animals  that like us animals are sentient They are subjectively aware They have interests in not suffering and continuing to live Nothing more is needed 2011 Lyotard states It is in the nature of a victim not to be able to prove one has done a wrong A plaintiff is someone who has incurred damages and who disposes of the means to prove it One becomes a victim if one loses these means One loses them for example if the author of the damages turns out directly or indirectly to be ones judge  the perfect crime does not consist in killing the victim or the witnesses  but rather in obtaining the silences of the witnesses 1988 8 Both the welfarist and the persecutor are judge Nonhumans are not simply siOenFed but in the Post refined of unethiFaO situations inFaSabOe of anthinJ but silence when it is only the action of the human that should be silencedceased Various misguided liberation and welfarist movements perpetuate decreasing animal suffering Very few welfarist arguments see abolition as a clear direct and most enigmatically obvious simple resolution Questions which are persistent from both pro and anti animal rights include of what are they capable what do we owe to them Rather what happens when we ask of what are we capable or what is possible in the absolute cessation of interaction with animals at a conceptual as actual level The issue of rights is a human intervention The issue of moral obligation of should is a human folly Any ascription of any quality to any nonhuman is a human compulsion toward vindication or liberation The animal remains the point of exchange the site of contestation but always the There is nothing to think of the animal Thus Derrida states It would therefore be a reinscribing this difference between reaction ascribed by Lacan to the human and response ascribed to the animal and hence this historicity of ethical juridical or political responsibility within another thinking of life of the living within a different relation of the living to their selfness to their autos to their own autokinesis and reactional automaticity to death to techniques or to the machine Derrida 2003 129 2f his readinJ of errida oOfe states µburied under the definite artiFOe here µthe aniPaO is aOO the heteroJeneit that Pakes the

observe differences within species  or within small groups of one kind of species  or even within one example of a species These are still nomenclature of life In a seeming paradox a certain kind of recycling of the word animal may simply refer to each every this one incarnation of life Unethical Equivalence Much has been written on the rights of nondominant others and their equivalencies While clearly antagonistic to my criticism of any equivalencies much of Posthuman Ethics deals with the inhuman other that is the other who is biologically but not culturally or socially viable as a certain kind of human As Adams points out the current ontological condition of animals has less to do with their being than with our consciousness 194 The animal conception of women racial others the diffabled the generally maligned interrogates the heart of the power of language in constituting the broad species of non countingashumans In what could be seen as a brave claim Derrida to an extent Lyotard and Nobel Prize Laureates Isaac Bashevis Singer and JM Coetzee see the operation of factory farming testing and other uses of animals as equivalent to the operations of Auschwitz a comparison which is beautifully and painfully explored in Charles Pattersons Eternal Treblinka Marjorie Spiegels The Dreaded Comparison Human and Animal Slavery has a similar historical project Where current traditional ideology often posits the humannonhuman animal as the great divide intrahuman divides from the very beginnings of philosophy have seen minoritarians as organisms related more intimately with animals than dominant humans The continuation of the suggestion that what we used to do to huPans was unthinkabO horrifiF and thus Fan be PaSSed on our current treatment of nonhumans is a seductive form of rhetorical pathos It is certainly needed in its capacity for diminishing the effect of the perpetuation of torture and murder fetishization and forced assimilation But this does not eradiFate the issue n faFt in refininJ the SroMeFt of aniPaO Oiberation throuJh humananimal connections it may even exacerbate speciesism Certain species seem more clearly appropriate in their

when the ruPSs OeJs and thiJhs of FhiFkens are reÀeFted in the ruPSs and thighs of woman what happens to other animals Does the great ape project Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition verify the value of the human because of closely shared DNA Will we understand that the Oedipalization of the pet is not a better way of treating animals It is certainly consumption of a different kind but discourse continues to envelop and slaughter all animals in unique subtle and devastating ways Flawed or human arguments which seek to liberate animals are irrefutably necessary in the incremental saving of life from the oppressions of the human and these arguments all in their own way seek to cease certain human behaviours albeit pleading via human logic The persistence of the human turn will never attain a philosophy of grace nor will any philosophy of the nonhuman Where one stream of theory has sought to create historical rather than contemporary equivalencies to elucidate the extremity of the current treatment of nonhumans others think that by using animality we can be liberated toward posthuman becomings Animals like women cannot become majoritarian Adams association of animal rights with womens rights is persuasive in pointing out what both want is freedom not to but from and not from situations or acts of cruelty or oppression or death but from majoritarian or any attendant regime of general equivalence between systems of value  necessarily accompanied b an utterO hoSeOess fetishiation of Srofit1 Guattari 1996a 122 The rights of an aniPaO to be free froP

sex Importantly for threshold and hybrid becomings while many advocates and rights philosophers address issues directly related to their own identity animal rights activists inherently speak as the irreducibly other because the other cannot speak the language which destroys it This is increasingly evident in recent US legal arguments which repudiate the rights of animals evaluated simply on the extent of their experiencing cruelty as wrong when it is for fun rather than cause to elevating animals to the status of entities with rights Property law and death as either one of autonomy or domination the question of whose property would give animals that very whoness that they are denied  who ness without equivalency based on similarity However the US supreme courts problem is that animals do not have standing to seek redress or assistance SlocumSchaffer 78 SlocumSchaffer points out that in various US legal cases violation of the rights of genetically engineered animals was ruled violation of patent that the refusal of students to dissect was acceptable based on the rights of students not animals The laws problem with animals is not that they may own their bodies but that they cannot recognize rules the very human paradigms which allow them to exist and which make them inferior as they apparently cannot make their own rules Serres states taxonomies to emphasize his point that the rational man and the foolish man differ in their affections and their affects but both strive to persevere in existing according to these affections and affects From this standpoint their only difference is one of power 1988b 102 Posthuman Ethics The declaration of the rights of man had the merit of saying every man and the weakness of thinking only men or men alone  objects

other is a seductive stepping stone not to how we should perceive nonhumans differently nor why maligned humans should be treated better than animals but explicitly why human discourse itself creates

for Srofit where SeoSOe dont care Unethical treatment of animals and women and unsympathetically Deleuze and Guattaris becoming animal terms and the posthuman fashion for demarcating fallacious patterns between technologies and insect and other nonhuman mapping theories involve legal contracts for which the other party has no agency or is acknowledged for its independent alterity really contracts between majoritarians for the use value of the object Animals are in the way or used for the way Joy Dunayer emphasizes human chauvinism is one type of speciesism 4 This is mirrored by Braidottis 2006 1059 however her claim that animal rights activism shifts the moral and legal balance in favour of animals 107 creates an unnecessary bifurcation Lyotard 1988 28 points out that such arguments involve placing the defender before the victim because the shift is created by someone the defender The animal cannot bear witness according to Lyotard and for this reason the animal is particularly in need as they neither create nor affect the paradigm directly Lyotard criticizes the belief in a universe prior to phrases but animals are prior to phrases and yet we implement them and only allow the possibility of their being or nonbeing as the speciesist would claim in this discursive world Thus the animal it could be argued is not one in a series of valued victims but its oppressed beingness makes its rights equivalent to other victimized beingnesses for no other reason than it is regardless of what it is Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition Whose Companionship Sympathetic explorations of animality coming from poststructural and posthuman theory seek to evocatively offer alternate potentializations of sense and perception based on fiJurations of the aOtered territories of ForSoreaO eSerienFe whiFh beOonJ to other species The most persistent question which prevails in much academic animal rights writing is perhaps ironically the same question that has allowed the oppression and slaughter of nonhuman bodies the question of who The tradition of observing the animal and denying it any rights because it is seen as a machine or a brute or an idea over which God gives the human dominion asks the same question but the response which vindicates speciesism is usually who it is not Utilitarianism comparative questions of personhood based on suffering and sense of a nonhumans own awareness of its existence and issues of welfare laid the groud for animal rights and from these posthuman trajectories have emerged Theorists who focus on the humananimal collapse and the question of Identity as a human investment when considering the liberation of the troubling concept nonconcept of animals such as Haraway Wolfe and Derrida to lesser or greater degrees ask the question in order to show three particular tendencies not simply in the humans formulation of relations between humannonhuman entities but the humans very capacity to ask itself the qualities which allow the question to emerge the paradigms which close off other questions and ultimately who has the riJht to sSeak where the wiOO be heard 7he first is the Tuestion of who whiFh critiques the whoness of the human Derridas persistent question is who am I even at the very point of its unanswerability The second is interrogating the humananimal species divide as fuzzy as

deeply troubling predispositions My and dog are both antagonistic to a posthuman ethics of nonhumanity Her dog is by being her dog the Oedipal dog In spite of her second question which is how is becoming with a practice of becoming worldly 2007 3 Haraway has missed the territory which diverges human Oedipal families to which the dog belongs from the abstract animal machines of becomings There is a becoming animal which is not content to proceed by resemblance and for which resemblance on the contrary would represent an obstacle or stoppage  an irresistible deterritorializations that forestalls attempts at professional Posthuman Ethics conjugal or Oedipal reterritorializations Are there Oedipal animals with which one can play Oedipus play family my little dog Deleuze and Guattari

ordinary and the profound absence of curiosity about and respect for and with actual animals 2007 27 Haraway performs a particular antagonistic and not entirely attentive reading of Deleuze and Guattari in two ways one of which is a reading I also contend The misreading Haraway and I would share is that for which Deleuze and Guattari have been critiqued by feminists such as Braidotti Irigaray Jardine and Massumi in reference to becoming woman Deleuze and Guattari use the minoritarian in order to facilitate a somewhat fetishistic adventure in what they are not insinuating cooption

becomings there are no more things into which to enter alliances or unnatural participations as Deleuze and Guattari call them only imperceptibility Haraway seeks to naturalize the unnatural participation of dog and human FonYenientO OookinJ for sPSathetiF reFonfiJurations of doPestiFation and that she calls the use of laboratory animals and animals murdered for food domestication is offensive while companionship is how she elegantly ablates the fact of dogs being enslaved through domestication No matter how deculturalized she sees the human companion while seeing the relation as natural it will always seem right Deleuze and Guattari show a belief in unnatural participations being here and now the notright as in not logical or based on commensurability within taxonomies that is all around us and that by seeing the unnatural as the only ethical direction shows both our responsibility and urgency in refusing the politics of comfort and resolution of humannonhuman relations which can be seen to be no better than the division of humannonhuman through disgust and subjugation Inevitably however Haraways main misreading comes from the fault of Deleuze and Guattaris concept of woman and animal in that they are not talking about women or animals They are talking about the abstract fabulations which deliver Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition siJnifiFation itseOf

those animal lives for which we are still responsible through depriving pets of their independence from humans over millennia of domestic enslavement Posthuman Ethics seemingly compulsory whether pragmatically or empirically concepts such as species is entirely resolvable within a posthuman ethic3 Further categorization is antagonistic to a posthuman ethic in that one must give way from category to singularity The question which dog in reality which life may sound absurdly simple but the persistence of the mentioning of species in antispeciesism is treacherous to the shift from

nonspeciesists often feel if they continue to be nonvegan and the point is akin to my use of Serres and grace that leaving animals and their eggs alone is the nonspeciesist option  not what the humans

collides with logocentrism Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition possible based on how to observe and classify5 Dialectic observation is part of the collapsed structure of metaphysics and humanism in philosophy science and the consideration of life The observer is perhaps the inobservable He must at least be last on the chain of observables If he is supplanted he becomes observed Thus he is in a position of a parasite Not only because he takes the observation that he doesnt return but also because he plays the last position Serres 2007 237 No matter how hard Derrida admonishes that observation by his cat makes him naked coupled with his criticism of Levinas by pointing out that in Levinasian ethics there is to my knowledge no attention ever given to the animal gaze 2008 107 the gaze is a human conceit and affording the animal a gaze continues to hold equality albeit sensitive to alterity as the mark of ethical attention toward animals Putting the human second to last is an act catalysed by the human in order to show responsibility toward the animal the human observing himself being observed by the animal creating an eternal return to the huPan in whiFh the aniPaO

SaradiJPs of SerFeStion  not within species but within each animal life  and that this can never be subsumed or incorporated into any mode of thought the human can formulate even if the human seeks to open the world to animal liberty By giving the animal the gaze the human takes the position he doesnt return by returning it to a human conceit Many of the arguments made for animal rights are constituted by the complexity of a species social group or with the feelings and responses a species shows when engaged with human interactions The deduction tells the human we should not treat an animal cruelly because they6 can feel we should not denigrate their complexity because they show a diversity of behaviours within their soFiaO struFture Jain we find ourseOYes within sstePs of eTuiYaOenFe in quality if not in kind and speciesism where certain species seem to exhibit more or less intricate interactions and responses None of these claims allow the animal to be without evaluating the reasons and validity of its beingness Lyotard 5 Brown sees Darwins relation to logic as one of secular capitalism and thoroughly humanist and metaphysical which makes it part of the human terrain posthumanism challenges 2009 13 6 I use the awkward and not entirely grammatically correct third person plural here This is not to homogenize animals as collectives but to avoid imposing human gender dimorphism on other life forms Posthuman Ethics states two points which resonate here In speaking of the Holocaust Lyotard states The plaintiffs conclusion should have been that since the only witnesses are the victims and since there are no victims but dead ones no place can be identified as a Jas FhaPber 1988   7he aSSOiFation of otards differend to the murdered animal is clear but the animal as differend is also the dead victim in that the living animal is dead to the capacity to negotiate its existence using the appropriate kind of phrase not to bear witness to its suffering but to bear witness to its ability to describe suffering within human paradigms Because this is impossible these descriptions come from human interpreters yet the inevitable problem of all animal speech being speaking for and speaking about animals emphasizes that all speech is human and all phrases are between humans The animal does not exist except as a human communication The animal does not exist as an animal or a life While we are human there are no animals only human ideas of animality The media wonders at and lauds the signing ape the speaking parrot the obedient dog who understands These individual animals speak human They are seen as clever and worthy because of their uncanny capacity to be human The protected species which dazzles through its aesthetic beauty  the big cat for example  speaks to our aesthetic language and must be saved But it is a species constituted by numbers not this cat or one cat but how many cats are left and how can more people see more cats for our pleasure One cow cannot speak human nor in its plentiful occurrences can it appeal with its scarcity Welfarists speak for the cow but someone somehow asks why the cow but rarely this or one cow or no use of species deserves its life The question should be not why we should question the treatment of certain animals homogenized as species and expect a reply nor why any animal should want to reply even though we think it would be in that animals best interest but what gives us the audacity to ask a nonhuman life any question The animal cannot be thought Therefore ethically the animal should not be thought If animal life and human life could be superimposed perfectly then neither man nor animal  and perhaps not even the divine  would any longer be thinkable Agamben 21 Agamben is critical of this turn seeing it as increasingly dehumanizing for human subjects Agamben however sees thought as necessary for human rights In the context of this chapter human thought more correctly operational tactical knowledge is the impasse that precludes any capacity for nonspeciesist ethiFs nowOedJe itseOf  defined as a FonsteOOation of noPenFOature totaOiinJ machine isomorphic dominance the repetitive and reifying patterns which continue the human logos  is what props discourse and discourse allows for thought Thought in a posthuman sense is thought from outside thinking the unthinkable but nonetheless necessary the incompossible incommensurable but possible the unanswerable question which answers in silent activism encounter without condition and most importantly if we are to encounter the nonhuman without being parasites the grace which can only come from leaving alone Traditional arguments would see more and more detail about the wonders of the animal as the most logical directive toward liberation Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition Posthuman ethics of grace requires nothing more than leaving all animals alone in interacting with them in thinking them in involving them at all with a human world Our becomingsinhuman do not devolve us toward more interaction with the natural world humanism and metaphysics cleave from us It delivers us from the inevitable destruction we wreak on that world The more we think that world the further it is irretrievably part of it Animals do not offer posthuman deliverance neither does rethinking the animal deliver nonhuman life As Serres says grace is a stepping aside and when the posthuman steps aside from discourse it steps aside from other life The logic of rights is a contract between species which was a result of humans acknowledging the damage we do No animals were involved in this contract just as no animals were involved in the contracts which tortured and murdered them The social contract was thereby completed but closed upon itself leaving the world on the sidelines an enormous collection of things reduced to passive objects to be appropriated Serres 2002 36 Rights are human laws Animal rights are human laws concerning contracts of liberty without the oppressed or liberated Immediate activism based on these rights is needed and do lead to certain individual lives being better But any intervention from human discourse will never break this perpetual contract against nature Animals do not need us except as a direct result of what we have done to them through domestication or destruction of habitat We use them the parasitic relation is never reciprocal we are never host Our discourse and communication about animals is a result of the ways we have exploited and ab used them parasite off them needed them and wanted them Arguments that aniPaOs need us are Àawed in their Fonstitution throuJh huPan FonFeSts 7he are often pragmatically and rightly based on the need for care borne of reliance on what our enslavement has made them depend Long term through preventing reproduction animals with close human dependent interaction this will be less relevant The natural contract outside of the capacity for human thought is the contract we make without knowing the tenets of the agreement because we do not know how to know them The contract is one of leaving alone and will as I will contentiously argue in the Epilogue ultimately demand of us the question of whether the only valid extinction is that of the human Abolitionists seek to abolish human intervention so abolish humans This makes the abolitionist approach to antispeciesism ethically posthuman Serres states War is characterized not by the brute explosion of violence but by its organization and its legal status  violence plus some contract  we must make a new pact a new preliminary agreement with the objective enemy of the human world the world as such  we must envisage along the other diagonal a new pact to sign with the world the natural contract 2002 1315 Posthuman Ethics To see the natural world the extrahuman world which we colonize with human siJnifiFation and oFFuS with deYastatinJ effeFts as antaJonistiF to the huPan world performs a beautiful dance just as Serres sees the philosophy of grace a dance Posthumanism directs a challenge to tenets of deconstructive elements of poststructuralism the zenith of which is Derridas maxim There is nothing outside the text As either the reading from the translation which suggests there is nothing outside of discourse or the French reading of textuality as a series of eternaO eOOiSses sOidinJ siJnifiers siJnifiers in debt to differenFe this Shrase has come to stand as both the cause and fate of human access or prevention of that access to the world The world can be understood as phenomena exterior to OanJuaJe reSresentation siJnifiFation but it is nonetheOess eYident within huPan experience what Derrida calls the prelinguistic mark and what elsewhere in Kristeva for example is known as the semiotic or Guattari the asemiotic Whatever vocabulary we use to attempt to encounter this experience we are struck with the realization there is no vocabulary for it Very simply if there is nothing outside the text is taken as an attentive description of human experience then a posthuman philosophy attests to the world being everything When nothing is overcome everything arrives as part of posthuman experience a connective traversive ecosophical ethics Nonhumans are both posthuman as extradiscursive but they are also part of their own textual worlds to which we are irreducibly alienated Tempting though it may be to from a welfarist and ethological desire explore map or only acknowledge social communicative methods in other species or relinquishing species in individual lives who experience think express and are affected we can never ask because we can never know Thinking we can whether to empathize or denigrate is a humanist metaphysical ambition This terminal etriFation between indiYiduaO OiYinJ entities both reÀeFts the PuOtiSOe subMeFt in its teeming internal schizoaffects intrahuman relations insofar as two human lives are always in an impasse within communication and constitutes a relation that is ethically connective because it requires creativity and grace Gracious communications are natural contracts and binding ties which Serres describes as that liasing element between two entities that can stretch taut and atrophy or become loose and supple The elements themselves are created by the cord much as Spinozan ethics sees the expressive and affective appetite and will of the organism as constituted through its capacity to express and be affected that is through its relation with another element The bond between two elements is the natural contract It only becomes law when it is overstretched or is used to yoke dyssymetrically Law marks limits The bond makes it possible to feel these borders but only when it beFoPes taut straiJht that is when it beFoPes Oaw 3rior to that it defines a space plane or volume free and unbound Or a zone of nonlaw within law Thus the variation before the frontier is reached is just as important as the border itself If the cord gets hard and stiff then it imitates solids at rest soft coiled folded Animalities Ethics and Absolute

unheard of matter in a singular emergence and connecting in ways for which human vocabulary has no verbs or nouns The nonhuman only remains such tactically the posthuman experimentally While interactions with nonhumans must be creative pleasurably or confoundingly so the contract precedes and constitutes the elements making the categories of nonhuman and posthuman tactical The object here is a quasi object insofar as it remains a quasius It is more a contract than a thing not a quasisubject but a bond Serres 1995 88 The nonhuman animal subject is still a different kind of quasiobject

animal rights is unethical because it uses the animal as currency within human rhetoric accountability and bearing witness is after aOO for and between huPans 1onhuPan aniPaOs are not benefitted b such human discourse even though it is apologetic and seeks to make amends Amending the history of the excesses of indescribable violence perpetrated on nonhumans comes as a step toward posthuman becomings elucidating the detrimental effects of human discourse and thus the urgent need to forsake it and the powers which it affords It is perhaps the why that catalyses posthumanism without FonFretiinJ JeneaOoJ or oriJin that SrediFts future or finitude oth the nonhuman animal and the posthuman through the ethical bond become nothing but nothings of different orders The nonhuman animal is nothing as it is unthinkable and nothing because it should be avoided in order to prevent human intervention in nonhuman worlds even if they overlap It is however everything and suffiFient to itseOf and Pust be treated thus 7he SosthuPan is nothinJ as it is also unthinkable but involves thinking multiply and otherwise Against all claims we need to rethink animals the only gracious ethics of nonhuman relation is to absolutely cease all thought which includes animals The teaching corps like the dancing corps and the thinking subject is forever evoking forever invoking calling another focus than itself So naked so blank so empty so absent that it brings forth a presence Serres 1995 45 Where Levinas claims we need an Other not necessarily perceived but encountered toward which we turn in order to form an ethical relation using Serres I argue that leaving the other alone is ethical invocation responsibility for our actions not their lives or existences Posthuman Ethics and calling forth independent of result perceived emergent entity The thinking posthuman subject perceiving without knowledge thinking without perceiving brings forth the other as its own coming Serres grace as stepping aside allows without Fondition SrediFtion or affirPation 7he ePerJent other owes nothinJ to the posthuman The posthuman is created when the focus is away from the human and away from the nonhuman animal it discusses to vindicate its unethical use and abuse of each nonhuman animal entity 7 Activist Absence We do not owe an obligation to those lives we have enslaved awaiting their natural extinguishment We do not need to bear witness for them as differends who can no longer bear witness to their own tragedy We can and must bear witness to what we have done and attempt to make lives of enslaved nonhumans as without intervention as possible In reference to so called domesticated animals this may involve intervention but not mastery intervention as passive nonhumans allowing the enslaved nonhuman to be without conditions of their being This will be an ethics based entirely on singular interactions and without prescription or species conditioned strategy The obligation

remembering the welfarist argument is only relevant in an unethical nonposthuman world Examples would be the need to look after enslaved animals who have become dependent on humans To this I would agree but add all these lives should be prevented from reproducing and continuing the enslaved dependence A more radical criticism and one about which I am still uncertain is that if a truly ethical posthuman cared for the abolition of animal suffering then predators would be neutered fed on synthetic food which would stop all unnatural animal death and further as much animal iOOness wouOd be treated as was SossibOe 7his wouOd Pean huPan interYention not for benefit of humans but nonhuman life Cessation of predation may mean exhaustion of food resources for nonpredators This could lead to the suggestion that the only way to prevent all suffering of nonhuman life would be to prevent any further reproduction of any life I am not yet convinced this is a nonviable idea The human element of this suggestion will be explored in the Epilogue Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition has a nonhuman conceit much in the same way as atheism claims there is no god while needing to engage the concept of god to give this claim veracity Agamben and Heidegger utilize this denial of the animals openness which I neither deny or affirP but FonfirP as beOonJinJ onO and whoOO to the huPan in order to Yerif the residual nonhuman in the human but on its own terms as beingness of a uniquely human kind that grapples with the human being that opens in order to perceive apprehend and qualify Agamben quotes Jakob von Uexkull claiming the animal has no object 2004 39 This is due to the object and object relations belonging only to the human Just as nothing is outside discourse evokes everything so falling away from being open immerses us in the everything While man always has the world before him  always only stands facing opposite  and never enters the pure space of the outside  the animal instead moves into the open in a nowhere without the no  Agamben 2004 57 Obligation the bestowing of rights welfarism and sympathy are according to an abolitionism view the civilized versions of totemism fetishism and metaphor They retain the object and to what and how the human will be open They retain the address The radical inversion of abolition is that the address will always be detrimental because humanism cannot address without the object to which it feels obliged but which in actuality it makes oblige themselves to the human Thinking the animal thinks the object and opens to the object in the turn that constitutes the human Veganism can be used here as an example Veganism is frequently constituted in three ways8  as denial or avoidance of certain foods as giving up of these foods and as exemplifying life without these foods primarily through life without intervention into animal life The third is the most gracious way Denying and avoiding foods retains openness to them as foods Giving them up reorients a focus on a somewhat Sious subMeFtiYit 9eJanisP as eYinFed b we who OiYe without whiOe defininJ without as no possibility of inclusion so the with does not insinuate their could be a with and the out is not a departure or prevented intervening shows the very basic bare reality of humans not needing and never having need for the products of slavery torture and murder This phrasing is used with the focus away from the potentially more emotive and humanist description of acts of violence and toward the not We do not Not the welfarist rights or moral philosophers we should not although that is the case except the we are those who decided what should and should not be We do not need to address encounter or maintain the parasitic relation with the nonhuman Any and all studies claiming what humans need are human studies and are belied by the simple reality of living vegan life Similarly if the example of vivisection is used the lives now living have lived hitherto until now Anything to FoPe Pa etend the FoPSuOsiYe infinit Shantasies of huPan Oife but beond the arguments for this form of science being either repugnantly capitalist for

or sFientifiFaOO sSeFious to the detriPent of the human organism we are in a position to step aside and leave be Veganism here is only one example and as it also belongs to the human taxonomy of subjects it is used tactically as a contemporary example of grace as the stepping aside The relationship between the vegan and the animal is ended From the practical to the paradigmatic veganism can be changed to thought itself as the unthought encounter with the outside ithin infinite reOations and thinkinJs of their own whiFh are absolutely inaccessible to human apprehension the nonhuman animal belongs to the outside they cannot enter into human discourse and discourses of nonhumans are inaccessible to humans Our entrance with within and as the outside creates an inÀeFtion a new

derealized What we are and have is already phenomenally too much as I will discuss in chapters 7 and 8 but from an abolitionist gracious paradigm the posthuman refuses parasitic needs Gracious posthuman attestation to the nonhuman animal delivers the animal and the human from law to freedom Law as prescriptive according to Lyotards reading of Kant deduces its conclusion Incrementally

This ensures obligation remains with the I You is diminished as a comprehensible addressee to a life with will and appetite unknown but to which we are obliged without demanding obligation or

Kant dependence constraint or coercion The addressee is not the one who is able to The addressor is the one who is able to who is the power Lyotard 1988 121 If the addressor makes ability a compulsory

Lyotard 1988 121 Our obligation to leave the nonhuman life alone from an activism perspective still obliges us to turn toward the other human to make demands not of you ought but you are able to because speciesist humans think they are either unable to live without animal slavery torture and murder which is fallacious or in the overwhelming face of animal abuse in all facets of human life they think they are unable to do anything because they really seek to tell the other human you ought to Command and response evince a lack of freedom of will of appetite But the submission most humans give to the you ought to shows that ability takes efforts of corporeality and imagination while succumbing to command fosters the luxuries of apathy many of which masquerade as a demand of the I for the right to abuse The right to dominance claimed by humans is the individuals exploitation of the perception of the you ought to as being you must but is actually you are able to but choose not to

green issues over animal life is speciesist and somewhat politically fashionable Nonetheless issues such as natural environment damage causing suffering to life are crucial to attending to the effects

Teras Teratology has referred to the study of monsters and monstrosity in all epistemic incarnations though most often in medicine Two inclinations resonate with two effects encountered in relations with monsters Irrefutable and irresistible wonder and terror have led in the life sciences to a compulsion to cure or redeem through making sacred or sympathy The effect monstrosity has upon the

icon of what is normal and thus the monster as what is not human For this reason the monster has an ideal and intimate relationship with the concept of the posthuman Posthuman teratology interrogates the conditions of possibility of being and knowing the human while offering examples from all discourses of how there is always something more in the human that delimits its parameters and

perturbation by which monstrosity is expressed Arguably Ponstrosit is Post often understood as a sSeFtaFOe of Àesh in µdeforPit or of capability in diffability for example But it also includes patterns of nonspecular expressivity such as behavioural or communicative diversions from what is Posthuman Ethics considered within the spectrum of unremarkable behaviour Each mode has its own unique

of monsters that becoming monster is fraught with the threat of being named monster by someone else in the wrong terms as the wrong kind of monster within the wrong discursive episteme But what becoming monster does successfully achieve is the emphatic refusal of categories and boundaries that have been set up for monsters semimonsters and the rare normal subject Braidotti emphasizes We need to learn to think of the anomalous the monstrously different not as a sign of pejoration but as the unfolding of virtual possibilities that point to positive alternatives for us all  1  7he YirtuaO

Monsters challenge all of these categories by being both resistant to and ambiguous within them Whatever the joys of love for and as monster the risks are great both towards our expectations of what posthuman teratology will mean in a real socioactivist context and also the risks we take by appropriating a concept that is dangerously linked with degrading and powerembedded practices Monsters in themselves are created through a bordering and create bordering encounters Within monstrous identity therefore there is already morethanone and relating with the monster mirrors this multiplicity within the singular There is no evidence of discrete identity not even bad identity Resonating with the turn to animality in posthuman theory the monster is a hybrid of animal and human But another way to utilize animality in posthuman teratology without assimilation or fetishization comes from fabulations of impossible combinations created not throuJh sutured forPs but interPinJOinJ intensities

where the only demarcation of objects comes through proximity and vibration or turbulence Why in this argument I maintain the monster as monstrous object is twofold First the monster is frequently that which is most likely to be demarcated as object for the other due to its particularly emphatic modes of collision affected by its extreme difference Constituted as aberration this collision makes OikeO the Ponster as reFeiYer Pore OikeO to reFeiYe in 6erres warninJ wa  beaten struck and so forth The ethical turn of the perceiving other will be a part of this sensation of diminishing affect toward the other But from a posthuman teratological creative perspective the emphasis on turbulence of familiar and stabilizing Yibrations waYed and Àows whiFh the Ponster FataOses Peans SerFeStion is Post likely to form new unthought of relations which encounter the monster as molecular synthesis rather than obstructive traumatic collision Love for Monsters onstituted b the order of siJnifiFation the subMeFt in SroiPit with the Ponster cannot sense because sense is blocked by knowledge just as harmony is destroyed by collision Errors are of sensation as perception so an object cannot be an erroneous subject the monster not an erroneous human Monstrosity is experienced as a viscous seduction of perturbation We can only name monstrosity under these conditions as mucosal inextricable molecular alteration of both objects as they are SerFeiYed b their Fonditions of sinJuOarO eSressed FoOOusion 6erres FaOO to sense is both a sensuousness and sensation as asePiotiF reOation 6ensuous

the I that it is always and already part of this collapse Discourse is both a description and an activity of separation Two elements in space standing against each other are also a continuing practice in time of maintenance and assurance through repetition The beings those who are the to be  to be the Ponster and to be the notPonstrous are aOwas a FonsistenF of beinJ as durational separative

OoYe in seeking sensation and grace in forsaking the human inclination to exert and maintain power through taxonomical ordering At this stage of thinking monstrosity comes a perplexing question What in this new desire does it mean to be a monster The troubling but somewhat necessary persistence of syntaxes of we and they have become confounded We speak of those who name while speaking of those who are named I have deliberately used this oscillating and sometimes frustrating pronoun use for two reasons 7he first aFknowOedJes µwe as in aOO subMeFts are FoPSOiFit in naming and exerting power through practices of knowledge This is most evident in historical genealogies of monstrosity taxonomy and teratology But it continues in any space where extrication from another is activated for purposes of preserving dominance or simply demarcation The second conversely welcomes and addresses the monstrosity that all subjects contain and the risks certain subjects take through political activities which enhance monstrosity through occupying spaces and performing actions that resist disrupt and make the concept of the normal transparent We are all monsters and all not monsters depending on our relation with signifying systems Power is its own act of desire Imagination through encounters with alterity that catalyse loss of self is a form of desire that is like the spectacle or encounter with the monster itself both frightening and FoPSeOOinJ seduFtiYe and danJerous 7hus Ponstrosit in its finaO definition as the siPSOe turbuOenFe that FoOOides or harPonies with the Àuidit of our own seOYes is nothing more than a wondrousness possible in all things which requires not the monster as entity but monstrous encounter The monster in this destructure is independent of all objects as it is a state of relation It is the in between the threshold and we are left with our selves as constituted as part of and through this The Wonder of Teras relation Without a relation of

to homogenize and regulate all life through limiting the system of operation as well as life itself Posthuman ethics create other ways for that which cannot be assimilated instead of the majoritarian options of being forced to be or slaughtered Yet while critiquing any attempt to exemplify I have nonetheless selected examples The diffiFuOt FonundruP of ethiFaO address to aOterities whiOe resistinJ

entirely ahuman inhuman posthuman becomings When the human becomingimperceptible politic dissipates the human into collective molecular assemblages with environment and cosmos when I becomes we is it
