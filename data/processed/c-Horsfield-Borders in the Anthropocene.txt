Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Address University of Warwick UK Correspondence rfhhorsfieldgmailcom This article performs a close reading of the Philip K Dick novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep While developing the argument for an ironic usage of the concept of the Anthropocene This ironised conception is one that intends to countenance both the Anthropocenes strength as a designation of human impact on the nonhuman and the important valid critiques responding to the Anthropocene Philip K Dicks work in particular Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is a superb illustration of such an ironic dynamic because of the dual narrative structure present For example Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep raises questions about human identity that while metaphysical have great significance materially for the characters in the novel and can be understood as a form of structural discrimination To demonstrate this ironic duality that should be brought to the Anthropocene the article draws on Nick Lands essay Kant Capital and the Prohibition of Incest A Polemical Introduction

Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 Man is the pie that bakes and eats itself and the recipe is separation Alasdair Gray Lanark Introduction Why Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep When thinking of Philip K Dick in relation to climate change the obvious place to start is his novel The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch Temperatures of 180C in formerly temperate zones such as New York make emigration from Earth necessary while the high capitalist society ever present in Dicks works seeks to profit from the immiserating circumstances in which the colonists find themselves via the Perky P Layouts miniature recreations of 20th century life and the communal hallucinogenic CAND The anguish of living apart from a dying Earth is a central component of the narrative in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch However while global warming underpins the novel and although one can discover motifs of ecological disaster in almost any major Dick story eg Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 An Ironic Anthropocene The epigraph chosen for this article reflects the multifaceted nature of the diagnosis implied in the Anthropocene of division A powerful criticism of the employment of the term Anthropocene is that it is far too broad and allencompassing in its implications to properly delineate a historical period in which humans have played a significant role in shaping the earths geological structure It is also potentially problematic in that it arguably obscures the specific historical political social and economic forces behind the actual changes In their persuasive chapter titled Who is the Anthropos from their book The Shock of the Anthropocene Bonneuil and Fressoz cite the example of the Yanomami Indians who hunt fish and garden in the Amazonian forest working three hours a day with no fossil fuel to ask the question should they feel responsible for the climate change of the Anthropocene Bonneuil  Fressoz 2014 70 In On the poverty of our nomenclature Eileen Crist argues that As a cohesive discourse the Anthropocene blocks alternative forms of human life on Earth from vying for attention By upholding historys forward thrust it also submits to its totalizing and in that sense spurious ideology of delivering continuous improvement By affirming the centrality of manas both causal force and subject of concernthe Anthropocene shrinks the discursive space for challenging the domination of the biosphere offering instead a technoscientific pitch for its rationalization and a pragmatic plea for resigning ourselves to its actuality Crist E 2016 25 Simultaneously given the scale and complexity of the trends we are confronted with when attempting to comprehend the trends latent in a term such as the Anthropocene and given the problem of determining exactly which force is responsible for the current ecological crisis  in the words of Donna Haraway all the thousand names are too big and too small all the stories are too big and too small Haraway 2015 160  this article will employ an ironic use of the term Anthropocene as unstable as it is in its unfolding This is also intended to reflect the unstable categories in DADES and what Quentin Samuel Miller describes as a complex and porous narrative about shifting environmental paradigms Miller 2017 4 This narrative duality or doubling of the metaphysical and the material is a dynamic I wish to bring to bear on the Anthropocene discourse The very fact that the term or discourse of the Anthropocene is contentious and viewed as an ideological palimpsest by some critics can be employed as a useful shorthand for indicating both the conventional original usage and the significant critical response Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 To help guide me through this doubling I will refer to Nick Land Land drew on Blade Runner the film adaptation of DADES for some of his most notable work in Machinic Desire and Meltdown However I will draw from Lands first short essay Kant Capital and the Prohibition of Incest A Polemical Introduction to the Configuration of Philosophy and Modernity in order to illustrate the doubled ironic Anthropocene in Dicks novel The reason for this decision comes from the startling correspondence between this essays formulation of a metaphysics of capitalist modernity via its reading of racist technologies and the political economy in DADES A further reason is that Kant Capital and the Prohibition of Incest makes its argument on philosophical and political levels a duality appropriate for reading a Philip K Dick novel Inhibited Synthesis of the Anthropocene Lands thesis in Kant Capital and the Prohibition of Incest stems from the premise that the Bantustans of Apartheid South Africa are a microcosm of capitalisms fundamental structure As Bantustans served to keep the black population at arms length from the wealthy white population they established a political distance between both whilst maintaining geographical proximity for black economic exploitation Land argues that the same relationship exists between the global metropolises and the colonial periphery Colonised peoples yield their resources and labour to capital but are excluded from the nations acquiring this wealth Land argues for this relationship by explicating the relationship between Kants conception of synthetic a priori and the theory of trade conceived by Claude LeviStrauss Kants theory of synthetic a priori knowledge is for Land the philosophical reflection of capitals accumulation of wealth the signature of an enlightenment society that wants both to learn and legislate for all time Land 2011 63 This is because synthetic a priori is a form of knowledge that is both given in advance by ourselves a priori and yet adds to what we know synthetic Ibid 64 This conceptual framework is inherently inhibitive for Land because it is a theory of knowledge that attempts to explain difference in advance and therefore to capture that difference through anticipation This reading of Kant is then applied to LeviStrauss account of rich food food given to another to consume and received from another which is food that derives its quality of richness not from its relation to class but upon a differentiation between tribes Ibid 68 The rich food is an external object given to another tribe it comes from outside Ibid 68 The rich food exchanged the primordial element of trade Ibid 69 alongside women for marriage develops a new bond of kinship one of alliance instead of filiation Ibid 68 Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 Land concludes that Kants conception of synthetic a priori knowledge is the philosophical culmination and base for the commodity By producing a synthetic a priori model for experience what is novel in the other finds itself contained Ensconced as such what is exterior to a conceptual system is anticipated processed by that anticipation and thus primed for commodification the rich food can be taken without the risk of marriage This per capitalisms function includes people with their labour and gives formal structure to the conception of a Bantustan relationship between the metropolis and the periphery A persons labour as a commodity is taken in the trade  economic proximity  but the accompanying marriage or cultural exchange is kept at a political distance In this tensile relationship which Land terms inhibited synthesis  which can be awkwardly described as patriarchal neocolonial capital accumulation Land 2011 63 capitalist modernity is caught in an intractable contradiction wherein its need for profit fuels an infinite requirement for the other which it is politically unable to imbibe What generates the contradiction in inhibited synthesis is what Land calls exogamic dissipation  extending Strauss intertribal exchange via marriage to the cultural exchange  or the dissolution of patriarchal cultural and ethnic identities through the continuous engagement people must have with those outside their traditional ties of kinship such as those inculcated by a nationality A limited example of this occurred with the emergence of the urban proletariat in the wake of the industrial revolution when those who were forced into the cities for work encountered each other became conscious of their commonality and began to agitate for their own interests Land proposes something larger and more radical a global explosion in the potentiality of exogamic marriages alongside the trade as conceptualized by LeviStrauss Such a global dissipation of identities and traditional bonds of kinship would also dissolve capitalism This global dissipation of the old patriarchal and provincial structures would generate a universal fraternal and horizontal kinship that could not tolerate exploitation On this basis capitalist modernity exhibits protofascist traits Land argues because it is constantly flirting with its own extinction Capitalist modernity enacts policies and builds infrastructures such as the Bantustan in order to keep kinship and trade systematically isolated from each other Ibid 62 Borders in the Anthropocene Neocolonialist capitalism has consistently employed brutal immigration policies and racist practices both within and outside of western countries in order to perpetuate the synthetic inhibition but it has done so with zones permitting the free movement of labour  the most prominent and formal of these being the European Unions Schengen Area bounded by Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 Fortress Europe a concept used to describe the complex of securitised immigration policies towards those who seek to cross the European Unions external borders especially its southern one Pinos 2009 3 This system has been described as a means to filter out and exclude the discomforting other that is to say the outsiders who challenge the EUs borders of comfort italicised for emphasis Ibid 4 Additionally the nationalist renaissance across Europe and North America especially with its emphasis on border control presents an intensification of the inhibitive process as those countries attempt to reverse the forces that are eroding the privileges of their bourgeois classes at both the geopolitical and socioeconomic levels In his 2016 review of Martin Heideggers black notebooks Malcolm Bull introduces Branko Milanovićs concept of citizenship rentthe increased income you get from doing the same job in one country rather than the otherin order to make the following comments At a time when the longheralded decline of the West is finally becoming an objective reality the lower middle class of the rich world stands in an ambiguous position Geography still counts for almost everything But if these trends continue citizenship rents will decline further and citizenship itself will be devalued as an asset What makes the current moment unique is that the ontological decline of the West has fallen into step with the decline in income differentials and attachment to place isnt just a matter of becoming indigenous and making yourself at home in the world but of stubborn attachment to a particular position in the global economic order Bull 2016 i Bull gives an account for a neocolonial order that is attempting to reassert itself through a reaffirmation of xenophobic identity in order to maintain economic preeminence Without recourse to reorganizing the worlds resources for a more equitable distribution of wealth capitalism and populations turn to a state of vicious retreat behind border walls The forces behind the inhibition of synthesis reassert themselves through strengthened technologies of racism What makes for a bleaker future is that there is every indication that the climatic and ecological deprivations associated with the Anthropocene will exacerbate this fundamental situation As many parts of the world follow a trajectory towards the uninhabitable as farming yields decline and as land and nations shrink or even disappear the far right nationalist rhetoric of blood and soil becomes very literal because climate change isnt just about things getting hotter and wetter under our current economic and political model its about things getting meaner and uglier Klein 2016 At the time of writing this article the UN does not legally recognise climate change as a qualifying criterion for refugee status and there is therefore Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 no formal legal protection for these affected people Beeler 2018 The arguments specifically put forward against offering legal protection include the fears of aggravating preexisting chauvinist sentiments making things worse for the very people the refugee convention aims to protect Ibid This reluctance to afford the climate migrant refugee status contains a tacit acknowledgement by the system of nationstates manifested in the UN of the political potential of mass migration especially when considering the numbers of people who will be dislodged by the climate crisis a billion per degree of temperature increase Seaton 2020 48 The disruption those fleeing pose to the infrastructure of synthetic inhibition  of borders formal nationalities and the accompanying security systems  has the potential to overwhelm it rending apart the international infrastructure of borders capital still depends upon effectively dissolving them by making encounters between peoples and their others unavoidable Fleeing the Bantustan destroys it This synthesis must be resisted at any cost for capitalist modernity to survive Antiimmigrant policies and the refusal to coordinate a comprehensive rescue policy between European countries for example has meant that the chance of death for a person crossing the Mediterranean between January and July 2018 was 1 in 18 Crisp 2018 A list compiled by UNITED recorded the death toll of people trying to cross the Mediterranean and enter Europe between the 1st January 1993 and the 5th May 2018 at 34361 UNITED 2018 Simultaneously such a large and systematic human cost requires a hierarchy of racial worth A hierarchy that I argue inhabits DADES Reading Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep When looking to understand the ideology within DADES the passage most useful to gain an insight into its worlds political economy is the brief explosive portion of an advertisement the character J R Isidore listens to as he shaves The TV set shouted  duplicates the halcyon days of the preCivil War Southern states Either as body servants or tireless field hands the custom tailored humanoid robot  designed specifically for YOUR UNIQUE NEEDS FOR YOU AND YOU ALONE  given to you on your arrival absolutely free equipped fully as specified by you before your departure from Earth this loyal troublefree companion in the greatest boldest adventure contrived by man in history will provide it continued on and on Dick 1997 18 Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 This Isidore informs the reader is part of a propaganda push from the Washingtonrun space colonisation program the chief economic drive in World War Terminus nuclear wake It is the promise of an organic android to fulfil YOUR UNIQUE NEEDS the you being a human a citizen of earth meeting the novels UNs criteria for humanity your unique needs which encompasses not just physical needs but emotional and symbolic A few lines down the government propaganda features an interview with a recent immigrant to Mars and she is asked Mrs Klugman how would you contrast your life back on contaminated earth with your new life here in a world rich with every imaginable possibility Dick 1997 18 Klugman answers I think what I and my family of three noticed most was the dignity The dignity Mrs Klugman the announcer asked Yes Mrs Klugman now of New New York Mars said Its a hard thing to explain Having a servant you can depend on in these troubled times I find it reassuring Dick 1997 1819 Mrs Krugmans soft short sentences Krugman has three sentences compared to the direct advertisements two her hesitation and the vagueness in her answer of reassurance complements the first part of the hysterical shouted propaganda Whereas the official pronouncement is explicit in its hyperbolic description of the androids utility Mrs Krugmans vagueness makes a sentimental appeal and gestures to the fantastical dimension of owning sentient labour The kernel of the propaganda and advertising for the driver of the greatest boldest adventure contrived by manthe androidincludes a selfcomparison to the chattel slavery of nineteenth century America What raises the passage from a crude comparison between sentient mechanical labour and slavery however is Dicks apparently heavy handed allusions to the latter which on first reading can be dismissed as crude commentary The propaganda is at pains to make an explicit comparison between the organic androids and slaves of the Antebellum South Because the comparison is diegetic an extra dimension comes into play The androids physical labour is not the sole source of the androids appeal as a commodity The experience of slaveowning itself is commoditised and standardised sold as an essential aspect of human individuality The white supremacist pastoral of the Antebellum prewar cathects the memory of a prewar earth The individual is recentered YOU as the focal point of economic expansion and activity in the wake of the destruction caused by the capitalist civilization that generated the same project of hyperindividuality This recentering is a buttressing of a specific identity of an anthropocentric identity that merges totally with a bourgeois identity Dicks material grounding of DADES in relation to a Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 specific period of American history enables an interpretation of the novel in the context of the Anthropocene and a distinctly selfconscious Eurocentric anthropocentrism This anthropocentrism derives from a desire to preserve and strictly regulate a human identity in order to maintain social cohesion for a new economic project that intends to recapture that Eurocentrism There are two discrete geographical zones in Do Androids Dream Earth and the colonies each of distinct significance Despite Earths devastation and despite the economic momentum being with the colonies organic androids are restricted by law from leaving the colonies Because androids are built exclusively for their labour powereven Rachael Rosen is a salesperson for her uncle Eldon Rosenany extrainstrumentality can pose a risk to the anthropocentric economic order For this reason illegal immigrationboth geographical and ontologicalrequires lethal policing Bounty hunters are disavowed agents of Earthbased law enforcement employed on a low salary and a commissionbased retirement bonus Earths remaining civilian population is unaware of the extent to which androids are pursued and murdered on earth because says Pris Stratton you people arent supposed to know Dick 1997 113 I think Isidore said youre mistaken Never in his life had he heard of such a thing Buster Friendly for instance had never mentioned it ts not in accord with presentday Mercerian ethics he pointed out Dick 1997 113 Isidore lives in a civilization formally recognising after World War Terminus all conventional terrestrial life as sacred However this does not constitute a bulwark against destructive economic or capitalist tendencies As he does with the Anthropocene avant la letter Philip K Dick depicts an Eremocene the age of human loneliness in a time of mass extinction coined by EO Wilson Wilson E O 2013 in DADES It does not present the spectre of ecological loneliness as a catalyst for the discontinuation of capitalism or domination but as a vehicle for a penetrating fetishising commodification Its apogee is the monthly Sidneys Catalogue pricing every animal according to its scarcity and the integration of this pricing into social relations Deckard is motivated in his work by the hope of owning a living organic animal like his peers In the Freudian sense of the word fetish animal life becomes a substitute mediating the affirmation of anthropocentrism and bourgeois patriarchal values Abortion is an offence punishable by death and there exists a class of people officially known as special within which there are subcategories of intellectual disability pejoratively referred to as chickenheads and antheads Isidore himself is a chickenhead Those who are special are the most affected by the environmental effects of radiation and forbidden to leave Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 much like those who are most affected by the policies of capitalist imperialist countries are those who face the largest obstacles to their escape Subjected to the hierarchy of human identity they are unsuitable for the novels UN colonization project While the crumbs of surviving nature are transformed into fetishised objects Dick imagines the remains of abandoned human habitations assuming natures role as the source of the negative and uncanny Isidore senses this energy named Kipple keenly throughout the novel From the useless pole lamp in the living room it oozed out meshing with the empty and wordless descent of itself from the flyspecked ceiling It managed in fact to emerge from every object within his range of vision as if it  the silence  meant to supplant all things tangible Dick 1997 20 Kipple is the name for the cumulative entropic presence of consumer goods abandoned after the mass migration from Earth presenting an oppressive weight and stripped of their utility unmoored by human depopulation It complements the destabilization of anthropocentrism brought about by the increasingly sophisticated androids in a manner eluding the techniques of android policing It is telling that this most acute description of Kipples effect comes from Isidore immediately after he turns off the TV screaming the advertisement for androids Kipple is in fact the reason Isidore turns on the TV in the first place The collective experience of Mercerism seems to have come from a move to counter that destabilization although the Mercerian hoax is of unknown origin Ibid 158 I didnt think it was true he said full of relief Why didnt you She swivelled to stare intently at him Bbbecause things like that dont happen The gggovernment never kills anyone for any crime And Mercerism  But you see Pris said if youre not human then its all different Dick 1997 122 Mercerian ethics by which empathy becomes an official institution and bulwark of the human species correspond with corporate and UN intentions to perpetuate the political economy of slavery by operating across both sociopolitical and metaphysicalontological narratives Mercers appearance outside of the empathy boxes to Deckard late in the novel do seem to contradict Buster Friendlys debunking However the appearance presents itself as an ideological validation of his bounty hunting job and social role Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 Am I outside Mercerism now Rick said As the chickenhead said Because of what Im going to do in the next few minutes Mercer said Mr Isidore spoke for himself not for me What you are doing has to be done Dick 1997 166 Mercer offers no explanation for why the retirements must take place beyond tautology but if Mercers conversation with Isidore is any indication Mercers position is fatalistic and permissive The only positive action Mercer takes in his appearance to Deckard is to warn him of Pris Dick 1997 166 It is here that Mercerian ethics and the accompanying empathy industry aligns most explicitly with their counterpart the Voigt Kampff test as technologies of racism Further Mercers empathy box experience is not only the prime example of doubling in the novel but also comes closest to the double rendition of Kantian subjectivity Land describes The Mercerian phenomenon as illustrated above allows for an experience of alterity that is circumscribed through ritual and its predetermined end However when Deckard and Isidore encounter the androids personally they must confront the ambiguity of the other themselves Deckard as Race Scientist Regardless of his personal doubts as to the business of retiring androids Deckard in his professional capacity is only troubled not compromised when it concerns his sexual interest Rachael Rosen and his aesthetic tastes Luba Lufts singing not because he considers androids beings who warrant care Like bourgeois ideation concerning immigrants Deckards valuation of androids is predicated on their usevalue or their capacity to disrupt Nevertheless Deckard is disturbed by his encounters with the other His relationships with the androids especially with Rachael chime with Lands assessment of modernitys appropriative movements a profound but uneasy relation to an outside that both attracts and repels it Land 2011 64 Consider Deckards perspective on android retirement As violent and graphic as the following passages are and despite the deliberately inconsistent deployment of pronouns they contain no details about each androids viscera or tissue the 38 magnum slug struck the android in the head and its brain box burst The Nexus6 unit which operated it blew into pieces a raging mad wind which carried throughout the car Dick 1997 73 The laser beam aimed with skill bifurcated Inspector Garlands head He slumped forward the corpse teetered on its chair and then like a sack of eggs it slid to one side and crashed to the floor Ibid 96 Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 The beam missed its mark but as Resch lowered it burrowed a narrow hole silently into her stomach She began to scream Like the picture Rick thought to himself and with his own laser tube killed her Luba Lufts body fell forward face down in a heap It did not even tremble Ibid 103 He fired at her as imploringly she dashed toward him The android burst and parts of it flewIm sorry Mrs Baty Rick said and shot her Ibid 168 He shot Roy Baty the big mans corpse lashed about toppled like an overstacked collection of separate brittle entities Ibid 168 Aside from the mentions of reflex circuits and brain boxes Deckard fails to describe the entrails and the reader only receives Isidores perspective of the corpses secondhand through Deckard This is strange although the androids physiognomy differs from a humans it is not simply the case that androids are composed of materials corresponding to reallife robotics The alternative to the VoigtKampf test is the Boneli test consisting of a bone marrow analysis by which a persons humanity can be organically determined Ibid 43 suggesting that the androids tissue is near identical to a humans This is before the other utility of an android  sex  is considered Phil Resch and Deckard both have sex with androids and Resch reports the commonplace practice of illegal android mistresses on the colonies telling Deckard sure its illegal but people do it anyhow Ibid 110 Androids are for the most part physiologically human Deckards perception and selfnarrativising of his social function as a bounty hunter reflects his troubled disavowal Nevertheless the androids do differ from humans For Isidore the androids Pris Irmgard and Roy seem strange As if a peculiar and malign abstractness pervaded their mental processes Ibid 119 However the novel leaves open the question of whether this malignity is innate to the androids or relational The VoigtKampf test demonstrates uncanny accuracy in distinguishing androids from humans by measuring empathy By measuring physical responses to questions othering becomes a technological practice even when the questions themselves are explicitly absurd and steeped in the civilizations social mores Humans are sufficiently standardized in their fetishization of preandroid life that the VoigtKampf test can be applied to anyone with the same decisive result Garlands observation to Rick that Its a chance anyway breaking free and coming here to Earth where were not even considered animals Where every worm and wood louse is considered more desirable than us put together Dick 1997 94 Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 does not go far enough animal life as a commodity literally constitutes the metric that determines whether extrainstrumental androids are executed Empathy is just a way of proving something that humans can do based on the humans word Ibid 158 Fetishised as such empathy becomes a form of scientific racism repurposed to deny the androids sovereignty as citizens and denies their right to free movement The androids have no option but violence to escape their slavery He doesnt understand yet Pris said in a sharp brittle stentorian voice how we got off Mars What we did there What we couldnt help doing Roy Baty grunted Ibid 124 The political economy of Dicks world bears striking similarities to the current climateaccelerated political economy of ours In addition to the simple fact that the androids like migrants are valued significantly less than charismatic megafauna the android when escaping their enslavement and entering Earth much like a person escaping to a country of the global North dissolves their clear identity as an unperson They are visible as a sapient feeling being They enter the liminal space on the lip of Lands synthesis Insofar as they impersonate a recognizable role Garland or Luft for example the android assumes citizenship of Earth plausible to their fellow person This to recapitulate is why I argue that people migrating to the global North are resisted most violently at the point of crossing the border Equally Land himself argued in his conclusion to Kant Capital and the Prohibition of Incest that a revolutionary war can only be fought in hell as the state apparatus of an advanced industrial society can certainly not be defeated without a willingness to escalate the cycle of violence without limit Land 2011 79 for this very reason Land envisages the ascension of feminine ie nonpatriarchal amazons to overthrow the capitalist reality and destroy the inhibition The android neatly assumes this role as its figure presents the uncontrollable eruption of feminine ie migrant alterity into the fathers heartland Ibid 62 Conclusion As is true in many of Philip K Dicks stories what happens to how the characters think about the world in DADES as opposed to the changes in the world itself assumes more importance to the narrative Despite the arrival of android amazons no revolution arrives at the end of the novel an exhausted Deckard returns to his wife after a long day of work Isidore shrinks miserably away under the shadow of Kipple Isidores lack of understanding and his distress as he watches the androids torture the spider spring from his strict adherence to Mercerian and UN orthodoxy Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 allows him to appreciate the androids as people a priori Because he honestly believes the anthropocentric dogma he can move beyond its ideological entrapment into a new modernity The androids would kill the spider and Deckard would disdain it because of its low status in the animal hierarchy Isidore wishes to care for it and keep it The Anthropocene as a term and discursive project instead of being discarded should be retained also with the intention that its universalizing project develops a new ecological and human kinship a new synthesis The nurturing societies are tasked with ensuring the Anthropocenes continuation whether they move to a postcapitalist future or not Robert is a graduate of the University of Warwick the
