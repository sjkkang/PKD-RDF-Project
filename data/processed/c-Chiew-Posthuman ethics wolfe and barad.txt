and unchallenged itys responsibility for and within the ecological order Since the late 20th century some of the most prominent works interrogating anthropocen tric worldviews have placed the ethics and politics of humannonhuman relations under much scrutiny Fundamentally the critical leverage in the use of the preﬁx post rests on the belief that the discrimination between Corresponding author Florence Chiew University of New South Wales Email florencechiewunsweduau httpwwwtheoryculturesocietyorg the human and the nonhuman is more given than interrogated In other words posthumanism calls into question the apparently obvious coher ence of human nature and aims to destabilize the basic premises of human exceptionalism ie the position that human beings are the most important species on the planet According to this line of critique human ways of knowing and being in the world do not have privilege or priority over the myriad variety of ways that nonhuman entities  eg computers animals plants microorganisms minerals and fossils  encounter and apprehend the world Signiﬁcantly the corollary of pur suing this perspective is to show that the identity of the human species is not uniﬁed or selfpresent but thoroughly implicated in the phenomen ology and ontology of other nonhuman entities Nevertheless the complexity of maintaining such a position is demon strated by the diversity of perspectives denoting where the exact locus of intervention lies posthumanism for some is about troubling the distinc tion between humans and nonhuman animals Wolfe 2010 Pettman 2011 Haraway 2008 for others posthumanism is about seeing the technological as an extension of human subjectivity Hayles 1999 2006 Thacker 2003 Miah 2008 for still others posthumanism is about interrogating humanitys role in environmental ethics Morton 2010 Pickering 2005 More recently the nonhuman turn epitomized by the intellectual movements of objectoriented ontology Harman 2002 and speculative realism Meillassoux 2008 rejects anthropocen trism by arguing that objects can exist independently of human thought and perception This shift in emphasis is also accompanied by a growing body of literature on anthropomorphic interpretations of animal sen tience Daston and Mitman 2006 Buller 2013 and morethan human environments Whatmore 2013 Jensen and Blok 2013 As Nikolas Rose puts it many things have led to this reframing of the human Some have to do with the cycles of theoretical fashion in the human sciences Some stem from a new sense of our precariousness as a species in the face of ecological threats and climate change 2013 4 Notwithstanding the diversity of possible reasons the stakes in managing and accounting for these conceptual conﬁgurations are signiﬁcant for how the fault line of discrimination between the human and the nonhu mananimalenvironment is drawn also motivates the reasoning behind claims for which life forms deserve more equitable kinds of moral treatment Yet interestingly although posthumanism as an intellectual move ment is marked by rather diverse lineages the competing moralities and seemingly opposed positions that shape its history share more in common than they may realize or like to admit In Scandalous Knowledge Science Truth and the Human 2006 Barbara Herrnstein Smith deftly captures the challenge posed by these varying intellectual commitments She points out for instance that the myriad factors Theory Culture  Society 314 motivating someone to appeal for responsibility toward one group and not another is as much a question about socialization political leanings and individual temperament as it is about being persuaded by an ethical cause Why we are drawn to a particular moral conviction or how we name and direct speciﬁc justiﬁcations for empathy or accountability raises emotionally demanding questions Smith oﬀers a compelling meditation on this issue The problem of our kinship to other animals mirrors that of our relation to other problematic beings for example the unborn the mentally disabled the drunk or the terminally comatose  beings that is who are recognizably our own kind but not yet not quite not just now or no longer what we readily think of as what we ourselves are 2006 153 emphasis in original Smiths poignant description here sums up the conﬂicting moralities that inform many a debate on what constitutes ethical culpability especially human responsibility toward the welfare of nonhuman others As Smith further elaborates matters become all the more contentious when the notion of responsibility is circumscribed by rather slippery identity mar kers that are used to stake a claim on which entity or group one is obligated to have regard for Should we she queries have care for dogs cats cows and horses but not birds snakes or butterﬂies For leopards and walruses but not lobsters or oysters For all these but not wasps ticks or lice Or for these too but not microbes or viruses 2006 154 In short Smiths searching questions illuminate the diﬃculty of determining what a proper aﬃnity between humans and nonhumans may look like or how the appropriate recipient of ethical consideration may be located Crucially the ambivalent meanings attributed to the status of the nonhuman often return us to a pervasive assumption namely that the originating source of responsibility is a human duty of care that is or ought to be extended toward other entities who will receive rather than enable it It is the underpinnings of this assumption that will concern us here As a prominent ﬁgure in posthumanist theory and the emergent ﬁeld of interdisciplinary animal studies Cary Wolfes work serves as an exemplary version of arguments that are persuaded by the prospect of a posthumanist ethics one which will cut across species barriers and in that respect mobilize a fundamental shift in our understanding of dis criminatory practices and moral responsibility This paper interrogates Wolfes posthumanist framework as he approaches the questions of activism and agency visa vis animal ethics and disability politics As will become clear although I share Wolfes aim in reworking traditional humanist tenets our arguments diﬀer on the problem of redeﬁning moral culpability as something that is peculiarly human By drawing Chiew attention to the contradictions in his own commitments to rethinking human exceptionalism this paper examines how Wolfes reading of abil ity and agency in animal rights and autism advocate Temple Grandin ironically reinstalls an understanding of moral agency that is grounded in the deﬁciency of another whose lack the human must supplement Nevertheless even though a critical tone will be apparent in my read ing of Wolfes posthumanist approach speciﬁcally of his conception of ethical responsibility the convictions that drive the following analysis bear considerable aﬃnity with his work In short the value of Wolfes theoretical rigour in rethinking humanist conceptions of ethics and sub jectivity is not repudiated Indeed in an eventual discussion of feminist and physicist Karen Barads work I suggest that the implications of Wolfes thesis of transspecies aﬃnity can be extended still further Wolfes brand of posthumanism is both ambitious and unusual as it brings together very disparate areas of thought Throughout his writings Wolfe makes sustained attempts to open up the question of subjectivity beyond species identities highlighting in many places that by identifying the presence of language conscious awareness and complex social behav iour in animals studies in areas as diverse as neuroscience cognitive ethology and ﬁeld ecology have troubled any neat distinctions separating the human from the nonhuman animal eg 2003a 2003b 2010 In What is Posthumanism 2010 a text now considered to be an important forerunner of the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of posthumanities Wolfe argues that one of his fundamental aims is to rework the ontologically closed domain of attributes thought to be uniquely human 2010 xxv He champions the cause for a transspecies empathy that will recognize the human as a human animal whose deﬁning characteristics are not so much exceptional as they are of a generalized animal sensorium Wolfe 2010 134 The notion of a transspecies aﬃnity is essential to the out comes Wolfe wishes to pursue However Wolfe reasons that this form of aﬃnity is at odds with the current debates around speciesism  attribut ing rights and values to beings based on their species membership Wolfe makes his stance expressly clear when he stresses that speciesism merits the same attention paid to the more familiar kinds of identity politics discourse against racism and sexism because the very rationale behind liberation and rights theories has in the past been used to determine and discriminate normal from less desirable kinds of human subjectivity The violence of humanism as Wolfe has reiterated forcefully is spe ciesspeciﬁc in its logic which rigorously separates human from nonhu man but not in its eﬀects it has historically been used to oppress both human and nonhuman others 1998 43 Within the contemporary context of animal ethics debates Wolfe points out that attempts to rethink the ethical status of animal subject ivity under the aegis of a more inclusive framework often rehearse an insidious form of humanism because they operate within the vernacular Theory Culture  Society 314 of rights and ability based discourse locked in a model of justice in which a being does or does not have rights on the basis of its possession or lack of morally signiﬁcant characteristics that can be empirically derived Wolfe 1998 13 On this topic Wolfe looks to renowned post colonial scholar Gayatri Spivaks deliberations on the anthropocentrism implicit in the history of liberationist political projects Many of these projects Spivak reasons circumscribe identity and ethics in terms of whether a being has made the qualifying cut for possessing properties that are deemed human enough The great doctrines of identity of the ethical universal in terms of which liberalism thought out its ethical programmes played history false because the identity was disengaged in terms of who was and who was not human Thats why all these projects the justiﬁcation of slavery as well as the justiﬁcation of Christianization seemed to be alright because after all these people had not graduated into humanhood as it were Spivak in Wolfe 1998 434 For Wolfe the gravity of Spivaks point has profound implications not just for thinking about humanitys moral obligations to nonhuman enti ties it is also a reminder of the atrocities that have occurred and continue to be exchanged within the human social community in the name of liberation and rights Explicitly drawing on this point in Animal Rites Wolfe asserts that the humanist concept of subjectivity is inseparable from the discourse and institution of speciesism    not only of animals but other humans as well by marking them as animal 2003a 43 empha sis in original Fundamentally Wolfe is guided by the conviction that what we have come to call ethics has from the outset been based on prejudicial practices That is received notions of ethics foreclose more inclusive frameworks because they are grounded in views that privilege the human as a species more deserving of moral attention For Wolfe a posthumanist ethics means broadening out the identiﬁcatory processes that deﬁne ethicality and subjectivity beyond species diﬀerences Given this what is curious about Wolfes more recent pursuit of a new conceptual conﬁguration of subjectivity  one that will unsettle the foun dation of human identity  is his concomitant resolve to hold forth on the particularities of the human In the opening pages of What is Posthumanism Wolfe writes The perspective I attempt to formulate here  far from surpassing or rejecting the human  actually enables us to describe the human and its characteristic modes of communication interaction mean ing social signiﬁcations and aﬀective investments with greater spe ciﬁcity once we have removed meaning from the ontologically Chiew closed domain of consciousness reason reﬂection and so on It forces us to rethink our takenforgranted modes of human experi ence including the normal perceptual modes and aﬀective states of Homo sapiens itself by recontextualizing them in terms of the entire sensorium of other living beings and their own autopoietic ways of bringing forth a world  ways that are since we ourselves are human animals part of the evolutionary history and behavioral and psychological repertoire of the human itself 2010 xxv empha sis in original This promise to deliver a greater speciﬁcity in deﬁning the human is one of the most exciting yet also challenging aspects of Wolfes posthuma nist appraisal how to secure the distinctiveness of the qualities that have deﬁned a speciﬁc humanism meaning consciousness reason reﬂection yet simultaneously situate them beyond their conventional human identiﬁcations To pursue this paradox Wolfe brings into conversation the theoretical trajectories of animal ethics and disability studies He ﬁnds common ground in these areas insofar as both challenge a model of subjectivity and experience drawn from the liberal justice tradition and its central concept of rights in which ethical standing and civic inclusion are pre dicated on rationality autonomy and agency 2010 127 The oppor tune example of this union Wolfe locates in the story of animal rights activist and autism advocate Temple Grandin As this move to amalgam ate the aims of animal ethics and disability politics forms a signiﬁcant aspect of Wolfes posthumanist thesis of transspecies empathy it is worth unpacking this line of reasoning paying particular attention to how Wolfe consolidates the notions of contingency and partial perspec tive in his critique of the humanist trope of visualityasmastery 2010 131 Temple Grandin Visuality TransSpecies Affinity and Suffering as Compassion Temple Grandin is a famous spokesperson for animal welfare particu larly in the area of humane slaughter in the livestock industry of the United States As someone who has lived with autism from a young age she is also widely recognized for her autism advocacy In her auto biographical accounts Grandin 2006 believes that her visual acuity and sensory hypersensitivity as an autistic have enabled her to build a special bond with the livestock she works with and as a result have also led her to design more eﬀective and humane livestock handling facilities Inspired by these selfreports and by the enabling insights of Grandins autism Wolfe surmises that Grandins story opens up new lines of Theory Culture  Society 314 empathy aﬃnity and respect between diﬀerent forms of life both human and nonhuman 2010 127 In What is Posthumanism Wolfe draws our attention to Grandins belief that the visual acuity she developed as an autistic individual has enabled her to communicate without language or words During my thinking process I have no words in my head at all Grandin says When I lecture the language is mostly downloaded out of memory from ﬁles that are like tape recordings    I look at visual images on the computer monitor of my imagination then the language part of me describes those images Grandin in Wolfe 2010 130 emphasis in original Curiously and importantly Wolfe interprets this explanation as evidence that Grandin is able to express herself through a visual rather than a verbal register 2010 129 As we have seen Wolfes entry point for critique is his stance against the humanist assumption that animals and beings deemed less normal or diﬀerent to the autonomous human subject are perceived to be lacking in some element of subjectivity or the capacity to respond and speak for themselves In his succinct expression it would be overly simple but not wrong to say that the basic formula here has been no language no subjectivity Wolfe 2003b xvxvi Thus using Grandins story Wolfe seeks to overturn this longstanding assumption that only through lan guage is one constituted as a subject who has the capacity for experience reﬂection or intellectual acuity To further substantiate his claim of a transspecies connectivity vis a vis Grandin Wolfe suggests that Grandin is implicated in what are for humanism two ontologically opposed registers both of them rad ically inhuman or at least ahuman 2010 130 emphasis added Wolfe problematizes the notion of visuality as it is stereotypically expressive of the humanist ability to survey organize and master space 2010 130 emphasis in original He claims that Grandins visual acuity as an autistic subverts this assumption and argues that Grandins visual prowess which typically would be considered as an indicator of ability is instead oﬀered here as an index of dis ability 2010 130 emphasis in original At the same time Wolfe interprets this enabled disability as a condition that has allowed Grandin to think like a web browser like a recording storage and playback device 2010 131 He reasons that these notions of the technical and the mechanical often deemed inhuman or ahuman are recovered indeed intensiﬁed in Grandins hyperacute perceptual apparatus Taken together Wolfe claims that disability becomes the positive indeed enabling condition for a powerful experience by Grandin that crosses the lines not only of species diﬀerence but also Chiew of the organic and inorganic the biological and mechanical 2010 136 emphasis in original This point needs to be ﬂeshed out as it shapes the way that Wolfe develops his reading of ethical responsibility as transspecies aﬃnity Consider the following example Wolfe believes that Grandins hypersen sitive perceptual apparatus by virtue of her experience as an autistic has helped her design career in the livestock industry This follows from Grandins reasoning that the visual experience of a prey species like cattle is diﬀerent from that of a predator species like humans because cattles eyes are evolutionarily designed to be on the side instead of in front of their heads as we would ﬁnd in humans For Grandin as it is for Wolfe this insight into cattles wideangle vision has inspired her to make some signiﬁcant design changes in existing feedlots so that the cattle could more easily and willingly move through the chute In her recollection of these design projects Grandin insists that until I made this observation nobody in the feedlot industry had been able to explain why one veterinary facility worked better than the other 2006 22 Tellingly Wolfe goes along with this account and surmises that Grandins ability to relate her experience as an autistic with hypersensi tive sensory faculties enables an acute awareness of how diﬀerent a cows visual experience is from our own 2010 129 emphasis added This observation is then used to lend credence to the claim that visuality may be animal it may be technical but it is anything but human 2010 131 emphasis in original There are signiﬁcant contradictions in this line of reasoning that merit attention In Wolfes analysis Grandins visual proﬁciency aﬀords her a better understanding of the visual experience of cattle because this per ceptual acuity is enabled by her disability Here the causal connections that Wolfe makes are glib and much too swift It is one thing to argue for the enabling possibility of disability that we certainly dont have to read disability as lacking and opposite in meaning to ability but quite another to claim that ones disability identiﬁes a unique ability that ordinarily abled individuals are unable to achieve In doing so Wolfe reproduces the identity politics he wants to contest for he has merely tipped the fulcrum over such that Grandins disability is now cast as a special sense of sight an insight that normal or nonautistic individuals cannot access Wolfes objective in using Grandins story is to highlight the con founding of the visible and the invisible to complicate the received tradition of thinking that vision is the mark of discrimination between the allseeing knower and the one deprived of sight or insight Yet in this analysis the humanist assumptions that reinstate the notions of auton omy and mastery underpinning Grandins anecdotes are not called into question This is not to diminish both Grandins design achievements in the livestock industry and her contributions to autism therapy Theory Culture  Society 314 However positing Grandin as someone with special hyperacute sensory capabilities in order to displace the humanist trope of vision paradoxic ally shortchanges what is most profound about the empirical and phe nomenological structures of visuality for all of us What does it mean to extrapolate as Wolfe does in his engagement with Grandin that visuality is anything but human By arriving at such a conclusion that Grandins visual proﬁciency is somehow other or alien to us Wolfes reasoning recovers a rather standard and conservative view of ability that rests on the discrimination between those who have it and those who dont have it More disturbingly Wolfes claim seems to diagnose a moralism that runs counter to his overall commitments vision abled equates with the bad nonvision disabled equates with the good It is worth highlighting that Wolfes inspiration for a posthumanist conception of ethics comes from German sociologist and systems theorist Niklas Luhmann In Luhmanns systems theory communication and observation are cast as secondorder phenomena in that they rest on the impossibility of seeing ones own blind spot eg 1995a 1995b Thus for Luhmann as for Wolfe sociality is enabled by a certain per spectivalism in which seeing can only proceed by way of the partial or restricted nature of ones worldview To this end Wolfe suggests that one of the most valuable insights in Luhmanns emphasis on selfreferential blind spots is that it oﬀers a way to reconﬁgure the tension between claims for the contingency of observationknowledge and a correspond ing criticism of the inability of such claims to found their argument on convincing grounds Although he highlights this tension in a number of diﬀerent contexts there is one particular description Wolfe oﬀers that captures the conundrum at stake On the one hand the critiques of the traditional philosophical para digms of positivism empiricism and the like which stress instead the contingency and social construction of knowledge pragmatism poststructuralism materialist feminism would seem politically promising because they hold out hope that a world contingently constructed might also be diﬀerently ie more justly constructed But on the other hand that very constructivist account has left intellectuals seeking grounds for their own political practice without a foundation from which to assert the privilege of their own positions 1998 xii emphasis in original Here the challenge that Luhmanns systems theory poses is that assum ing any moral political or social position inevitably rests on an inter diction of selfexemption Luhmann in Moeller 2006 112 Stated diﬀerently a position cannot be posited outside the very problem it deems unethical Importantly for Wolfe what constitutes an ethical pos ition understood in terms of Luhmanns systems theory acknowledges Chiew that that position can only point selfreﬂexively to its guiding principles because its perspective is partial to itself It cannot step outside itself to gain a moral high ground over other positions We may recall that one of the most compelling insights that Wolfe oﬀers in his posthumanist theory is his critical acknowledgement that reworking humanist ethics and politics cannot simply mean extending the boundary conditions of acceptable or normal entry points to include the previously underrepresented or persecuted Indeed Wolfe is emphatic about this when he clariﬁes that his aim in using the story of Grandin is not to play the oldest and most predictable trump card in the identity politics deck  my constituents are more marginalized than yours 2010 140 However Wolfes critical acuity here appears to be at odds with his ethics of compassion Ultimately Wolfe appeals to the possibility of a posthumanist ethics in which subjectivity in his rendering is neither disabled nor normal but something else altogether a shared transspecies beingintheworld constituted by complex relations of trust respect dependence and com munication 2010 141 Accordingly for Wolfe this leads to a recon ceptualization of how ethically bound the human is to other forms of life bound in our shared vulnerability to other living beings who think and feel live and die have needs and desires and require care just as we do 2010 140 This undertaking points us toward the necessity of an ethics based not on ability activity agency and empowerment but on a com passion that is rooted in our vulnerability and passivity Wolfe 2010 141 emphasis in original To this end Grandin provides the context for Wolfe to marry the cen tral problematic of ethics or what constitutes moral standing with that of an identity politics that asks who is the subject of ethical consideration In this amalgamation of concerns Wolfe insists that it is only by recogniz ing a transspecies aﬃnity that the question of posthumanist ethics can be brought into a sharper focus However his overriding emphasis on the exceptional aspects of Grandins disability amounts to the claim that as a result of Grandins autism her visual acuity as a mark of her disability surpasses that of an ordinarily sighted individual In other words for Wolfes thesis to cohere his argument has to be staked on a logic of reasoning that is similar to the identity politics claims in question Grandin as disabled and because this disability provides her with an aﬃn ity with the cattle she works with is an identiﬁcatory process that singles out an ethical intervention But in doing so Wolfe glosses over the irony that by concurring with Grandin that her experience with autism has given her special visual abilities that otherwise normal individuals lack the very contention that Wolfe sets out to refute is unquestioningly rein stalled the humanist assumption of visuality as mastery as well as the sorts of abilitybased discourse that are grounded in debates over who has or does not have certain properties to qualify for moral consideration Theory Culture  Society 314 For Wolfe compassion with its literal meaning to suﬀer together is a way to connect with the nonhuman animal by recognizing the shared fact of suﬀering that underpins existence itself In other words acknowl edging an aﬃnity that is anchored in the poignant reminder of mortality and ﬁnitude regardless of species diﬀerence captures the most basic sense of compassion Importantly this reminder that we suﬀer together challenges the ontological containment of the human as a superior spe cies and interestingly returns us to the earlier problematic that began this discussion namely Wolfes intention to displace and sustain the speciﬁ city of the human This tension between repudiating humanism and maintaining the unique capacities of the human results from Wolfes interpretation of what is involved in an ethical relation The quandary is that Wolfes rigorous insistence on the ontological status of the human as always already a human animal is at odds with his investment in the question of ethical culpability as a responsibility that originates in the human and is extended toward the nonhuman animal In this delineation of what grounds an ethical relation prejudice is peculiarly human The diﬀerence between human and nonhuman one that is more assumed than proble matized remains intact Consequently Wolfes approach to the notion of transspecies connectivity remains wedded to a rather linear and derivative sense of human compassion toward nonhuman others who would receive rather than give or indeed enable it It is to this extent that I think Wolfe undercuts what could be a much more illuminating argument namely that to conceive the speci ﬁcity of human identity is to open up the very identity of life as some thing of a general sensorium in his own description a transspecies beingintheworld 2010 141 However if one subscribes to this read ing what needs to be confronted honestly and openly is that the trans species empathy that Wolfe encourages through the concept of compassion may not be selfevidently benign kind or good The cru cial point here is that if we are always already connected  indeed if connectivity is what aﬀords the ontological experience of our individual viability  ethics cant simply oppose the good to the bad one to the other or take the good with the bad one and the other What is needed is a diﬀerent understanding of the production of binarity itself Of course we are at this point faced with a profoundly unsettling suggestion for the radical sense of transspecies connectivity that Wolfe feels so strongly committed to must also imply that the questions of cruelty violence abuse or indiﬀerence do not disappear They endure because ethical responsibility this transspecies experience as a social fact of suﬀering compassion will compromise any pure sense of an opposition between good or evil benign or cruel  indeed not just between human and nonhuman animal but between human beings within the one socius Chiew Intraactive Entanglement Karen Barads Posthumanist Performativity To venture another reading of ethical inquiry I want to turn our atten tion to the work of feminist and particle physicist Karen Barad As one who not only practises science but also writes in the tradition of feminist science studies Barad occupies a unique position in which to reconcile the perceived incompatibility between notions of subjectivity and scien tiﬁc objectivity epistemology and ethics discourse and matter In Meeting the Universe Halfway Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning 2007 she oﬀers a refreshing and certainly coun terintuitive take on ethical responsibility and human agency Using the insights of quantum mechanics Barad proposes a posthumanist per formative approach to reexamine the representationalism and human ism that underpin conventional understandings of scientiﬁc knowledge and what grounds an ethical relation Against representationalist accounts that assume knowledge about nature or reality is mediated by human observation and language Barads thesis questions this long standing partitioning of matter and meaning nature and culture At the forefront of her argument is a profound sense of systemic entanglement that confounds the metaphysics of individualism in Western thought that is the belief that the world is populated with individual things with their own independent sets of determinate proper ties Barad 2007 19 Where traditional representationalism casts the inquiring subject as incontrovertibly human and distinctly individual Barads posthumanist performative approach radically opens up the question of how the human emerges in and even as the worlds self encounter As we will see the implications of this dilated frame of inquiry for thinking about ethics are farreaching According to Barad the physical phenomenon of diﬀraction is integral to the key insight in quantum mechanics that the observer and the observed are fundamentally entangled or indeed ontologically insepar able 2007 73 When two stones are dropped in a body of still water for example the resulting ripple eﬀect caused by disturbances in the water produces an interference or diﬀraction pattern In classical physics dif fraction is generally understood as the process by which waves bend around objects to produce alternating patterns of areas of wave intensi ties Barad 2007 77 Importantly in classical physics as Barad points out diﬀraction patterns can only be produced by waves and not par ticles since as separate portions of matter particles cannot occupy the same position at the same time 2007 81 However and this is what makes diﬀraction crucial to quantum physics under certain experimental circumstances diﬀraction eﬀects have been found for electrons atoms and neutrons  forms of matter routinely considered to be made up of particles ie discrete bits of matter This is the famous puzzle of the Theory Culture  Society 314 waveparticle duality typically associated with English scientist Thomas Youngs twoslit experiment As the twoslit experiment is central to Barads overall argument that epistemology ontology and ethics are inextricably intertwined it is worth mulling over some of its key provocations Originally devised to understand whether light is composed of par ticles or waves the twoslit experiment works by emitting a light source through two parallel openings on a plate and observing what happens on the screen behind when the light source passes through When a beam of light is emitted through the apparatus a diﬀraction pattern ie a wave emerges However when the light source is reduced such that only one photon is released at a time what is observed on the screen is not two scattered patches of light corresponding to where the photons are expected to land Instead what the screen registers is a wave a diﬀrac tion pattern This is a curious ﬁnding as it raises the question of what constitutes the nature of matter If only one photon is sent through the apparatus at a time what interfered with the photon particle to produce a diﬀraction pattern Puzzling over this Barad asks Does an individual electron interfere with itself Does a single electron somehow go through both slits at once How can this be Doesnt each electron go through one slit or the other 2007 102 emphasis in original The broader implication of the ﬁndings from the twoslit experiment is highly signiﬁcant If as classical physics instructs photons and electrons  bits of matter  are discrete particles with determinate properties then how can they also manifest wave behaviour since waves by deﬁnition cannot be localized to a single point How to put it another way is the nature of matter and light local yet general in its materialization Here we might recall a similar theoretical conundrum that Wolfe faced in his posthumanist project that insists on preserving the speciﬁcity of the human species and simultaneously reconﬁguring the human animal as something of a general sensorium While Wolfe does not frame his com mitments in terms of the quantum rendering of partwhole entanglement his acknowledgement that any posthumanist account is necessarily of a paradoxical nature because it comes both before and after humanism 2010 xv approximates the quantum insight that the emergence of one entity is somehow also an expression of its entire frame of reference Indeed one could argue that a convincing and cogent posthumanist pos ition is paradoxical because the production of its diﬀerence from human ism is not one of separation but of diﬀerential becoming This point will become clearer in a moment To get some purchase on the perplexing questions raised by the two slit experiment Barad turns her attention to the work of celebrated physicist Niels Bohr Bohrs interpretation of the waveparticle duality paradox challenges the representationalism and metaphysical individual ism inherent in classical approaches to value and measurement Chiew According to Bohr there is no sense in asking where the electron or photon is prior to the measuring process This is the basis of his indeter minacy principle which states that we cannot concomitantly know both the position and momentum of a particle because particles do not have ﬁxed values of position and momentum Barad 2007 19 In other words the waveparticle duality paradox for Bohr is not an epistemo logical problem about knowledge and uncertainty whether we can or cannot know reality Bohr argues that the waveparticle duality paradox evokes a fundamental question about the ontology of life and the nature of reality itself For Bohr there is no absolute distinction between matter and representation because the capacity of the apparatus that presum ably measures and gives meaning to the value of an object does not exist independently of the measuring process In the case of the twoslit experi ment the value of a particle that is whether matter manifests wavelike or particlelike properties emerges only in and as measurement itself In a series of gedanken or thought experiments  many of which with the beneﬁt of technological advances have actually been performed and conﬁrmed in experimental labs Barad 2007 105  Bohr demonstrates that matter will exhibit wave or particlelike behaviour contingent on the speciﬁc material setup of the apparatus used to measure the experimen tal outcome For instance by modifying the twoslit apparatus so that the upper slit is a movable diaphragm suspended from springs one would be able Bohr says to detect which slit each particles goes through by observing the amount of displacement created by the movable dia phragm Barad 2007 266 Now crucially the ability to determine which slit each particle passes through is not a result of a mixture of particles p 268 some of which enter the top slit while others enter the bottom slit but an experimental arrangement that makes it possible p 268 Bohrs critical insight into the waveparticle duality paradox is that value and measurement are coconstitutive the nature of the observed phenomenon changes with corresponding changes in the appar atus Barad 2007 106 emphasis in original If a particular experimen tal arrangement is designed to respond to the particlelike character of the object of inquiry then that is what is observed One ﬁnds particlelike behaviour and not a diﬀraction pattern Correspondingly if the experi mental setup is introduced to investigate the interference pattern of light or matter the material speciﬁcity of that arrangement conﬁrms it At ﬁrst glance this ﬁnding seems to suggest that the process and out come of the experiment are arbitrary However when read carefully the gravity of the point being made is that value or evaluation does not pre exist the apparatus it is materialized in and as the speciﬁc process of measurement that is carried out including the particular exclusions that are enacted This is an important point that bears reiterating For Bohr as Barad tells us the boundary between the object of observation and the agencies of observation is never ﬁxed as such 2007 114 Theory Culture  Society 314 Instead the very possibility of making this subjectobject cut presents itself as the moment of measurement arises and where certain choices are made to the exclusion of others Here signiﬁcantly any exclusion is constitutive of the apparatus since it enables and provides the condition for establishing boundaries and measurement interactions As Barad emphatically insists we are not entitled to ascribe the value that we obtained for the position to some abstract notion of a measurement independent object 2007 113 Rather what Bohrs analysis shows is that there is no unambiguous or inherent distinction between the human subject with the agency to observe and to measure and the object that is presumably nonhuman and outside the ﬁeld of agency In this confounding scene of agential entanglement even the question of what constitutes the boundaries of an apparatus is radically reconﬁ gured An apparatus for Barad is not a standalone instrument waiting to be applied to a particular experimental setup She says The particular conﬁguration that an apparatus takes is not an arbi trary construction of our choosing nor is it the result of causally deterministic power structures Humans do not simply assemble diﬀerent apparatuses for satisfying particular knowledge projects but are themselves speciﬁc parts of the worlds ongoing reconﬁgur ing To the degree that laboratory manipulations observational interventions concepts and other human practices have a role to play it is as part of the material conﬁguration of the world in its intraactive becoming Humans are part of the worldbody space in its dynamic structuration 2007 1845 This originary intraactive becoming does not imply that there are no diﬀerences between objects or events but that the production of any diﬀerence has no preexisting or independent reality outside the speciﬁc physical arrangement of the system or apparatus  the worlds self encounter and selfmaking The point as Barad states cogently is not simply to put the observer or knower back in the world as if the world were a container and we needed merely to acknowledge our situat edness in it 2007 91 emphasis in original Rather she argues we do not obtain knowledge by standing outside of the world we know because we are of the world 2007 185 emphasis in original Against conven tional understandings of causality time and space and the metaphysical individualism that assumes the world is composed of discrete and autonomous entities Barads notion of intraactivity makes a persuasive and timely argument against human exceptionalism Indeed as a radic ally diﬀerent kind of posthumanist intervention Barads argument reminds us that to destabilize the selfcertainty of humanism is to acknowledge that the human is an expression of the apparatus of life and world constantly taking measurement of itself Chiew An Ethics of Humanism Reworked If we return to Wolfes posthumanist ethical framework through Barads notion of intraaction it becomes clear that advocating for compassion as a form of transspecies aﬃnity is fraught with complication The rub is this a general sensorium as Wolfe proposes cannot exclude the disabled the animal or those who discriminate against them At stake then is not just an impugning of the privileged human subject for what is at issue pertains to the privileging of any identiﬁcatory process that promises to single out one point of diﬀerence as the locus of discrimination deserving of greater moral attention andor indictment Put simply what consti tutes compassion as a corrective for cruelty or injustice is not at all straightforward For if the question of ethics is truly opened up in a general sensorium that is an ethics that implicates all of life as a transspecies entanglement then the rightness or wrongness of an eth ical conundrum are not separate or opposing determinations Put plainly Wolfes notion of transspecies aﬃnity does not preclude compassion or violence The recognition that responsibility is not secured in one individual event or location will recast the very meaning of culpability and how we continue to approach questions of blame accountability and ethical relations To be sure this is not a suggestion that we relinquish our sense of personal agency because after all our intentions and interven tions are determined by the ongoing structuration of the world Rather it is precisely because we are the world we seek to understand that our participation matters Barad 2007 396 In this ethics of mattering how ever what constitutes culpability presents itself with all its inconsistencies and competing justiﬁcations as the quandary that changes and morphs into diﬀerent possibilities diﬀerent contingencies Consequently what determines compassion as an ethical response is invigorated as an involvement of these previous possibilities and not as a moral compass that orients us from a position outside the object of violation While both Wolfe and Barad make the argument that there is no privileged locus of observation outside or above the object of inquiry there is a decisive diﬀerence in the way that the same claim is made in their works Barads appreciation of the constitutive eﬀect of exclusions 2007 59 means that no perspective is simply lacking or partial Recall that for Wolfe via Luhmann it is the partial or restricted nature of ones worldview the impossibility of seeing ones blind spot that allows other secondorder observations to enter as remedial observations This is an important point for Wolfe given his commitment to the partiality and social contingency of the very concept of ethics Yet if we read Wolfes thesis of a general sensorium with Barads notion of intraactive becom ing one is faced with a view of ethicality that has farreaching implica tions even as it also raises discomforting questions about the nature of Theory Culture  Society 314 being Stated diﬀerently if the basic logic of selfreferentiality in systems theory is to suggest a more counterintuitive and implicated sense of what it means to assume an ethical position or perspective as Wolfe wishes to pursue this must also mean that the ethics and politics of discrimination are not outside ontology but are indeed what motivates and animates the system of life This sense of general systematicity can be found in Barads notion of the apparatus where every perceived separation or discrimination is not prescribed by or prior to its material conﬁguration If we heed this reading how we conceptualize the speciﬁcity of an entity or event will embrace a rather diﬀerent sense of what enables it in the ﬁrst place In other words taking Barads argument for the entanglement of know ledge and life seriously  we know because we are of the world  involves an understanding of ethical agency and accountability whose limits may not necessarily be conﬁgured by the human Indeed what constitutes the limits of the human in this confounding origin of intraactivity should be the question posed at the forefront of any inter vention into humannonhuman relations The point is not to deny or collapse the distinctions that are drawn between human and nonhuman animals Rather the more provocative suggestion here is that the perceived errors of humanism are also already facets of Lifes determination to organize itself understand itself to be present to itself  even in its missteps How we make sense of our rela tions in the world  in fact how we are the world making sense of itself  constitutes enduring questions about the nature of sociality that is the ontological inseparability of nature and humanity As Peta Hinton in her sustained engagement with Barad contends this ontological inseparabil ity implies that everything is accountable in the worlds diﬀerential becoming and the terrain of ethical inquiry shifts from how can I pro duce an ethical relation to the broader consideration of how am I produced ethically 2013 183 emphasis in original In this astute reconﬁguration of human exceptionalism Hinton reminds us that what is most instructive about Barads argument lies in its insistence that we participate in bringing forth the world in its speciﬁcity including our selves Barad in Hinton 2013 183 By implication then the very possibility of a posthumanist ethics cannot be located beyond humanism as a corrective for what appears to be lacking in humanist ethics and politics  at least not without being involved selfreferentially or diﬀractively in this general ecology of movement that is life Indeed if what determines an ethical call cannot be deﬁned outside of or prior to the instance of a moral quandary if the ethical does not preexist the scene of violation or error but is constitutive of it then ethical inquiry is an expression of the myriad ways by which Life bears itself It is in this sense that we may challenge and redeﬁne our views of culpability and moral responsibility as exclusively human Chiew Acknowledgements I would like to thank the six anonymous reviewers for the many insightful and generous comments on
