of Electric Sheep Ananyo Bhattacharya toasts Philip K Dicks prescient sciencefiction classic as it turns 50 K Dicks 1968 Sheep a word caught his eye It was friendlily How had Dick got that past an editor As Watts told me I knew at that point that Dick had to be some kind of sick genius Further on in the novel are the boldly redundant disemelevatored and the sublime kipple  a word for junk that encapsulates the stuffs sinister tendency to multiply entropically Only brazenly Yet to debate Dicks strengths as a stylist is to miss the point of Androids For as with much of his oeuvre 44 novels 121 short stories and 14 shortstory collections it is ideas that propel the book into the imagi native stratosphere  and inspired director Ridley Scott to craft the masterly 1982 film adaptation Blade Runner the film But Blade Runner is only nominally based on the original Dicks prescience in Sheep PHILIP K DICK Doubleday 1968 PHILIPPE HUPPGAMMARAPHOGETTY wellwritten and engaging the detail can become ponderous more than 100 pages are devoted to military and civilian facili ties connected to Russian biodefence A more judicious use of examples with the remainder relegated to appendices would have been preferable to repetitive lists The book is also short on synthesis fail to tell a coherent story For example link the Russian establishments apparent growing willingness to research weap ons based on new physical principles  which is likely to include biological agents  to its increasingly vehement accusa tions that the United States is engaging in dubious biological research Instead the authors vague policy prescriptions to the US government seem out of place Outright allegations might have under mined the authors carefully marshalled facts and dispassionate analysis But this indeterminacy is like watching a pros ecutor present a stack of circumstantial evidence then walk out of the courtroom without delivering a closing argument The authors case might be circumstantial but it is a strong one A forceful concluding chapter with appropriate caveats about speculation versus fact  might have done the reader a great service My guess  and it is just a guess because there is no hard evidence  is that Russia is capa ble of working on any pathogen with any technique from CRISPR geneediting to gainoffunction research the world outside Russia The scholarship and cogent analysis in Biosecurity in Putins assessment of the countrys biological warfare capability by the worlds best intelligence agencies The book is overall a fascinating reflection of the complex web of interests and institutions that have con verged to drive Russias current orientation towards biosecurity As tensions between the West and Russia grow questions are bound to arise about Russias

portrayal of a society in which humanlike robots have emerged at the same time as advances that make people more pliable and predictable like machines The film eschews the intricacies of plot that bring this to the fore in the book Dick 192882 was in many ways as paradoxical as his work He read widely and was well versed in the science of his day such as the cybernetics of Norbert Wiener Yet his formal education ended with school Shortly after enrolling at the University of California Berkeley in 1949  to study subjects includ ing philosophy  he dropped out possibly owing to the vertigo and agoraphobia that troubled him throughout his life The pop ular image of him which he encouraged was of a hallucinogenaddled mystic But it was amphetamines that fuelled Dicks most heroic bouts of productivity in 196364 he wrote 6 novels in 12 months His extraordi narily fecund imagination did the rest Dick wrote Androids in 1966 Others of his books such as Ubik 1969 and his great alternative history The Man in the High Castle 1962 were also garlanded with praise Yet none has perhaps so viscerally affected researchers as Androids Set in a postapocalyptic 1992 the book follows bounty hunter Rick Deckard in a risky mission to retire destroy six state oftheart Nexus6 androids who have fled to Earth after killing their human mas ters in a Martian colony Nexus6s can be distinguished from humans through the VoightKampff test This assesses capacity for empathy a human facility that even the most intelligent androids lack Deckard embarks on the hunt amid dreams of buying a pet with the reward Nuclear fallout has extinguished most ani mal life and pets are major status symbols Lifelike robotic animals abound such as the blackfaced sheep that Deckard owns but they are ultimately disappointing Through caring for an authentic beast he and his wife Iran hope to transcend the existential fug of living on a planet abandoned by all but the dregs of humanity Adherents of the religion Mercerism they feel bound to share such transcendental experiences with others by means of an empathy box a machine that meshes human consciousness These days academic discourse around the work dwells on what distinguishes humans from sophisticated robots  driven by the film Dicks approach was more nuanced The name Deckard for instance echoes that of seventeenthcentury French philosopher René Descartes who asked whether it was possible to distinguish with out direct access to their minds a human from an automaton Deckard explores that ambiguity wondering uneasily whether he himself is an android He passes the Voight Kampff test but towards the end of the novel he recognizes a kind of kinship with his quarry The electric things have their lives too he says Paltry as those lives are Whether such machines should also be accorded rights is a question that research ers wrestle with today Artificialintelligence specialist Joanna Bryson among others has argued that granting autonomous robots legal personhood would be a mistake it would render their makers unaccountable Bryson an admirer of the book believes that the mass production of machines with humanlike goals and ambitions should be prohibited But Dicks chief preoccupation in Androids is not the almosthuman robot as moral subject His synthetic beings are inhu man in important ways They are unable to participate in the rituals of Mercerism for instance And their leader Roy is a brute who is summarily dis patched The film endows him with empathy and even liter ary flair saving Deckards life as he delivers an unforgettable swansong about Cbeams that glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate Rather Androids is a meditation on how the fragile unique human experience might be damaged by technology created to serve us The idea that people risk injuring themselves physically or psychically by anthropomorphizing machines is not far fetched We bond easily with machines A study last year showed that many people are embarrassed to ask digital assistants such as Apples Siri questions that betray their own ignorance S Kim et al Psychol Sci 29 171180 2017 As far back as the 1990s electronic pets called Tamagotchis that demanded nearconstant care led some own ers to neglect important duties The builtin compliance of robotic sex dolls currently in development risks eroding relationships Androids explores this blurred human machine boundary through Deckards existential anxiety and through the Penfield mood organ This device allows humans to dial up urges or emotions such as the desire to watch TV no matter whats on it by input ting a number Named after Wilder Penfield the reallife twentiethcentury neurosurgeon who showed that brain stimulation could elicit sensations and visions the organ rei fies Dicks fear that humans could become more robotic In this Dick has been proved spectacularly right As bioethicist Matt Lam kin has observed pharmaceuticals that make people happier or more productive  but less contemplative  approximate the mood organs effect The smartphone may be the ultimate mood organ rather than dialling up their own emotions however users are increasingly manipulated by the algorithms of tech titans To help counter such dehumanizing effects philosopher Evan Selinger and law scholar Brett Frischmann say that it is time to devise a reverse Turing test Rather than identifying machines that are indis tinguishable from humans as the original does the reverse test would determine the extent to which humans remain truly human Dick would not have been surprised by any of it In Androids Iran senses her own blunted emotional response to a life in which caring for machines is the apogee of exist ence for many and Earth has been deserted by the smartest Her answer is to schedule a sixhour bout of selfaccusatory depression twice a month  Ananyo Bhattacharya is a science correspondent at The Economist His short fiction has been published
