Anneke who endured commented and sup ported me throughout the process all my love as ever Introduction Not all of us can say with any degree of certainty that we have always been human or that we are only that Some of us are not even considered fully human now let alone at previous moments of Western social political and scientiﬁ c history Not if by human we mean that creature familiar to us from the Enlightenment and its legacy The Cartesian subject of the cogito the Kantian community of reasonable beings or in more sociological terms the subject as citizen rightsholder propertyowner and so on Wolfe 2010a And yet the term enjoys widespread consensus and it main tains the reassuring familiarity of common sense We assert our attachment to the species as if it were a matter of fact a given So much so that we construct a fundamental notion of Rights around the Human But is it so While conservative religious social forces today often labour to reinscribe the human within a paradigm of natural law the concept of the human has exploded under the double pressure of contemporary scientiﬁ c advances and global eco nomic concerns After the postmodern the postcolonial the postindustrial the postcommunist and even the much con tested postfeminist conditions we seem to have entered the posthuman predicament Far from being the nth variation in a sequence of preﬁ xes that may appear both endless and somehow arbitrary the posthuman condition introduces a unit of common reference for our species our polity and our relationship to the other inhabitants of this planet This issue raises serious questions as to the very structures of our shared identity  as humans  amidst the complexity of contemporary science politics and international relations Discourses and representations of the nonhuman the inhuman the anti human the inhumane and the posthuman proliferate and overlap in our globalized technologically mediated societies The debates in mainstream culture range from hardnosed business discussions of robotics prosthetic technologies neu roscience and biogenetic capital to fuzzier new age visions of transhumanism and technotranscendence Human enhance ment is at the core of these debates In academic culture on the other hand the posthuman is alternatively celebrated as the next frontier in critical and cultural theory or shunned as the latest in a series of annoying post fads The posthuman pro vokes elation but also anxiety Habermas 2003 about the possibility of a serious decentring of Man the former measure of all things There is widespread concern about the loss of relevance and mastery suffered by the dominant vision of the human subject and by the ﬁ eld of scholarship centred on it namely the Humanities In my view the common denominator for the posthuman condition is an assumption about the vital selforganizing and yet nonnaturalistic structure of living matter itself This natureculture continuum is the shared starting point for my take on posthuman theory Whether this postnaturalistic assumption subsequently results in playful experimentations with the boundaries of perfectibility of the body in moral panic about the disruption of centuriesold beliefs about human nature or in exploitative and proﬁ tminded pursuit of genetic and neural capital remains however to be seen In this book I will try to examine these approaches and engage critically with them while arguing my case for posthuman subjectivity What does this natureculture continuum amount to It marks a scientiﬁ c paradigm that takes its distance from the social constructivist approach which has enjoyed widespread consensus This approach posits a categorical distinction between the given nature and the constructed culture The distinction allows for a sharper focus in social analysis and it Introduction mechanisms that support the construction of key identities institutions and practices In progressive politics social con structivist methods sustain the efforts to denaturalize social differences and thus show their manmade and historically contingent structure Just think of the worldchanging effect of Simone de Beauvoirs statement that one is not born one becomes a woman This insight into the socially bound and therefore historically variable nature of social inequalities paves the road to their resolution by human intervention through social policy and activism My point is that this approach which rests on the binary opposition between the given and the constructed is currently being replaced by a nondualistic understanding of nature culture interaction In my view the latter is associated to and supported by a monistic philosophy which rejects dualism especially the opposition natureculture and stresses instead the selforganizing or autopoietic force of living matter The boundaries between the categories of the natural and the cul tural have been displaced and to a large extent blurred by the effects of scientiﬁ c and technological advances This book starts from the assumption that social theory needs to take stock of the transformation of concepts methods and political practices brought about by this change of paradigm Con versely the question of what kind of political analysis and which progressive politics is supported by the approach based on the natureculture continuum is central to the agenda of the posthuman predicament The main questions I want to address in this book are ﬁ rstly what is the posthuman More speciﬁ cally what are the intellectual and historical itineraries that may lead us to the posthuman Secondly where does the posthuman condition leave humanity More speciﬁ cally what new forms of sub jectivity are supported by the posthuman Thirdly how does the posthuman engender its own forms of inhumanity More speciﬁ cally how might we resist the inhumane aspects of our era And last how does the posthuman affect the practice of the Humanities today More speciﬁ cally what is the func tion of theory in posthuman times This book rides the wave of simultaneous fascination for the posthuman condition as a crucial aspect of our historicity but also of concern for its aberrations its abuses of power and the sustainability of some of its basic premises Part of the fascina tion is due to my sense of what the task of critical theorists should be in the world today namely to provide adequate representations of our situated historical location This in itself humble cartographic aim that is connected to the ideal of producing socially relevant knowledge ﬂ ips over into a more ambitious and abstract question namely the status and value of theory itself Several cultural critics have commented on the ambivalent nature of the posttheoretical malaise that has struck the contemporary Human and Social Sciences For instance Tom Cohen Claire Colebrook and J Hillis Miller 2012 emphasize the positive aspect of this posttheory phase namely the fact that it actually registers the new opportunities as well as the threats that emerge from contemporary science The negative aspects however are just as striking notably the lack of suit able critical schemes to scrutinize the present I think that the antitheory shift is linked to the vicissitudes of the ideological context After the ofﬁ cial end of the Cold War the political movements of the second half of the twentieth century have been discarded and their theoretical efforts dis missed as failed historical experiments The new ideology of the free market economy has steamrolled all oppositions in spite of massive protest from many sectors of society imposing antiintellectualism as a salient feature of our times This is especially hard on the Humanities because it penalizes subtlety of analysis by paying undue allegiance to common sense  the tyranny of doxa  and to economic proﬁ t  the banality of selfinterest In this context theory has lost status and is often dismissed as a form of fantasy or narcissistic selfindulgence Consequently a shallow version of neoempiricism  which is often nothing more than datamining  has become the meth odological norm in Humanities research The question of method deserves serious consideration after the ofﬁ cial end of ideologies and in view of the advances in neural evolutionary and biogenetic sciences can we still hold the powers of theoretical interpretation in the same esteem they have enjoyed since the end of the Second World War Is the posthuman predicament not also linked to a posttheory mood For instance Bruno Latour 2004  not exactly a classical Introduction produced by networks of human and nonhuman actors things and objects  recently commented on the tradition of critical theory and its connection to European humanism Critical thought rests on a social constructivist paradigm which intrin sically proclaims faith in theory as a tool to apprehend and represent reality but is such faith still legitimate today Latour raised serious selfquestioning doubts about the function of theory today There is an undeniably gloomy connotation to the posthu man condition especially in relation to genealogies of critical thought It is as if after the great explosion of theoretical cre ativity of the 1970s and 1980s we had entered a zombiﬁ ed landscape of repetition without difference and lingering mel ancholia A spectral dimension has seeped into our patterns of thinking boosted on the right of the political spectrum by ideas about the end of ideological time Fukuyama 1989 and the inevitability of civilizational crusades Huntington 1996 On the political left on the other hand the rejection of theory has resulted in a wave of resentment and negative thought against the previous intellectual generations In this context of theoryfatigue neocommunist intellectuals Badiou and Žižek 2009 have argued for the need to return to concrete political action even violent antagonism if necessary rather than indulge in more theoretical speculations They have contributed to push the philosophical theories of poststructuralism way out of fashion In response to this generally negative social climate I want to approach posthuman theory as both a genealogical and a navigational tool I ﬁ nd it useful as a term to explore ways of engaging afﬁ rmatively with the present accounting for some of its features in a manner that is empirically grounded without being reductive and remains critical while avoiding negativity I want to map out some of the ways in which the posthuman is circulating as a dominant term in our globally linked and technologically mediated societies More speciﬁ cally posthu man theory is a generative tool to help us rethink the basic unit of reference for the human in the biogenetic age known as anthropocene the historical moment when the Human has become a geological force capable of affecting all life on this planet By extension it can also help us rethink the basic tenets of our interaction with both human and nonhuman agents on a planetary scale Let me give some examples of the contradictions offered by our posthuman historical condition Vignette 1 In November 2007 PekkaEric Auvinen an eighteenyearold Finnish boy opened ﬁ re on his classmates in a high school near Helsinki killing eight people before shooting himself Prior to the carnage the young killer posted a video on YouTube in which he showed himself wearing a tshirt with the caption Humanity is overrated That humanity be in a critical condition  some may even say approaching extinction  has been a leitmotif in European philosophy ever since Friedrich Nietzsche proclaimed the death of God and of the idea of Man that was built upon it This bombastic assertion was meant to drive home a more modest point What Nietzsche asserted was the end of the selfevident status attributed to human nature as the common sense belief in the metaphysically stable and universal validity of the European humanistic subject Nietzschean genealogy stresses the importance of interpretation over dogmatic implementation of natural laws and values Ever since then the main items on the philosophical agenda have been ﬁ rstly how to develop critical thought after the shock of recogni tion of a state of ontological uncertainty and secondly how to reconstitute a sense of community held together by afﬁ nity and ethical accountability without falling into the negative passions of doubt and suspicion As the Finnish episode points out however philosophical antihumanism must not be confused with cynical and nihil istic misanthropy Humanity may well be overrated but as the human population on earth reaches its eighth billion mark any talk of extinction seems downright silly And yet the issue of both ecological and social sustainability is at the top of most governmental programmes across the world in view of the environmental crisis and climate change Thus the question Bertrand Russell formulated in 1963 at the height of the Cold War and of nuclear confrontation sounds more relevant than ever has Man a future indeed Does Introduction horizon of our shared future or are there other options The issue of the limits of both humanism and of its anti humanist critics is therefore central to the debate on the posthuman predicament and I will accordingly devote the ﬁ rst chapter to it Vignette 2 The Guardian reported that people in wartorn lands like Afghanistan were reduced to eating grass in order to survive1 At the same point in history cows in the United Kingdom and parts of the European Union were fed meatbased fodder The agricultural biotechnological sector of the overdevel oped world had taken an unexpected cannibalistic turn by fattening cows sheep and chickens on animal feed This action was later diagnosed as the source for the lethal disease Bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE vulgarly called mad cow disease which caused the brain structure of the animals to corrode and turn to pulp The madness here however is decidedly on the side of the humans and their biotechnological industries Advanced capitalism and its biogenetic technologies engender a perverse form of the posthuman At its core there is a radical disruption of the humananimal interaction but all living species are caught in the spinning machine of the global economy The genetic code of living matter  Life itself Rose 2007  is the main capital Globalization means the commercialization of planet Earth in all its forms through a series of interrelated modes of appropriation According to Haraway these are the technomilitary proliferation of micro conﬂ icts on a global scale the hypercapitalist accumulation of wealth the turning of the ecosystem into a planetary appa ratus of production and the global infotainment apparatus of the new multimedia environment The phenomenon of Dolly the sheep is emblematic of the complications engendered by the biogenetic structure of con temporary technologies and their stockmarket backers Animals provide living material for scientiﬁ c experiments 1 The Guardian Weekly 35 January 2002 p 2 They are manipulated mistreated tortured and genetically recombined in ways that are productive for our biotechno logical agriculture the cosmetics industry drugs and phar maceutical industries and other sectors of the economy Animals are also sold as exotic commodities and constitute the third largest illegal trade in the world today after drugs and arms but ahead of women Mice sheep goats cattle pigs rabbits birds poultry and cats are bred in industrial farming locked up in batterycage production units As George Orwell prophetically put it however all animals may be equal but some are deﬁ nitely more equal than others Thus because they are an integral part of the biotechnological industrial complex livestock in the European Union receives subsidy to the tune of US803 per cow This is considerably less than the US1057 that is granted to each American cow and US2555 given to each cow in Japan These ﬁ gures look all the more ominous when compared to the gross national income per capita in countries like Ethiopia US120 Bangladesh US360 Angola US660 or Honduras US9202 The counterpart of this global commodiﬁ cation of living organisms is that animals have become partly humanized themselves In the ﬁ eld of bioethics for instance the issue of the human rights of animals has been raised as a way of countering these excesses The defence of animals rights is a hot political issue in most liberal democracies This combina tion of investments and abuse is the paradoxical posthuman condition engendered by advanced capitalism itself which trig gers multiple forms of resistance I will discuss the new post anthropocentric views of animals at length in chapter 2 Vignette 3 On 10 October 2011 Muammar Gaddaﬁ  deposed leader of Libya was captured in his hometown of Sirte beaten and killed by members of the National Transitional Council of Libya NTC Before he was shot by the rebel forces however Colonel Gaddaﬁ s convoy was bombed by French jets and by an American Predator Drone which was ﬂ own out of the 2 The Guardian Weekly 1117 September 2003 p 5 Introduction from a base outside Las Vegas3 Although world media focused on the brutality of the actual shooting and on the indignity of the global visual exposure of Gaddaﬁ s wounded and bleeding body less atten tion was paid to what can only described as the posthuman aspect of contemporary warfare the telethanatological machines created by our own advanced technology The atrocity of Gaddaﬁ s end  his own tyrannical despotism notwithstanding  was enough to make one feel slightly ashamed of being human The denial of the role played by the advanced worlds sophisticated deathtechnology of drones in his demise however added an extra layer of moral and political discomfort The posthuman predicament has more than its fair share of inhumane moments The brutality of the new wars in a globalized world run by the governance of fear refers not only to the government of the living but also to multiple practices of dying especially in countries in transition Bio power and necropolitics are two sides of the same coin as Mbembe 2003 brilliantly argues The postCold War world has seen not only a dramatic increase in warfare but also a profound transformation of the practice of war as such in the direction of a more complex management of survival and of extinction Contemporary deathtechnologies are posthuman because of the intense technological mediation within which they operate Can the digital operator that ﬂ ew the American Predator Drone from a computer room in Las Vegas be con sidered a pilot How does he differ from the Air Force boys who ﬂ ew the Enola Gay plane over Hiroshima and Nagasaki Contemporary wars have heightened our necropolitical power to a new level of administration of the material destruction of human bodies and population Mbembe 2003 19 And not only human The new necrotechnologies operate in a social climate dominated by a political economy of nostalgia and paranoia on the one hand and euphoria or exaltation on the other 3 The Daily Telegraph 21 October 2011 This manicdepressive condition enacts a number of varia tions from the fear of the imminent disaster the catastrophe just waiting to happen to hurricane Katrina or the next environmental accident From a plane ﬂ ying too low to genetic mutations and immunity breakdowns the accident is there just about to unfold and virtually certain it is just a question of time Massumi 1992 As a result of this state of insecurity the socially enforced aim is not change but con servation or survival I shall return to these necropolitical aspects in chapter 3 Vignette 4 At a scientiﬁ c meeting organized by the Dutch Royal Academy of Sciences about the future of the academic ﬁ eld of the Humanities a few years ago a professor in Cognitive Sciences attacked the Humanities headon His attacks rested on what he perceived as the two major shortcomings of the Humani ties their intrinsic anthropocentrism and their methodologi cal nationalism The distinguished researcher found these two ﬂ aws to be fatal for the ﬁ eld which was deemed unsuitable for contemporary science and hence not eligible for ﬁ nancial support by the relevant Ministry and the government The crisis of the human and its posthuman fallout has dire consequences for the academic ﬁ eld most closely associated with it  the Humanities In the neoliberal social climate of most advanced democracies today Humanistic studies have been downgraded beyond the soft sciences level to some thing like a ﬁ nishing school for the leisurely classes Consid ered more of a personal hobby than a professional research ﬁ eld I believe that the Humanities are in serious danger of disappearing from the twentyﬁ rstcentury European univer sity curriculum Another motivation behind my engagement with the topic of the posthuman therefore can be related to a profound sense of civic responsibility for the role of the academic today A thinker from the Humanities a ﬁ gure who used to be known as an intellectual may be at a loss to know what role to play in contemporary social public scenarios One could say that my interest in the posthuman emerges from an all too human concern about the kind of knowledge and intellectual values Introduction we are producing as a society today More speciﬁ cally I worry about the status of university research in what we are still calling for lack of a better word the human sciences or the Humanities I will develop my ideas about the university today in chapter 4 This sense of responsibility also expresses a habit of thought which is dear to my heart and mind as I belong to a generation that had a dream It was and still is the dream of actually constituting communities of learning schools universities books and curricula debating societies theatre radio televi sion and media programmes  and later websites and computer environments  that look like the society they both reﬂ ect serve and help to construct It is the dream of producing socially relevant knowledge that is attuned to basic principles of social justice the respect for human decency and diversity the rejection of false universalisms the afﬁ rmation of the posi tivity of difference the principles of academic freedom anti racism openness to others and conviviality Although I am inclined towards antihumanism I have no difﬁ culty in recog nizing that these ideals are perfectly compatible with the best humanist values This book is not about taking sides in aca demic disputes but rather aims to make sense of the complexi ties we ﬁ nd ourselves in I will propose new ways of combining critique with creativity putting the active back into activism thus moving towards a vision of posthuman humanity for the global era Posthuman knowledge  and the knowing subjects that sustain it  enacts a fundamental aspiration to principles of community bonding while avoiding the twin pitfalls of con servative nostalgia and neoliberal euphoria This book is motivated by my belief in new generations of knowing sub jects who afﬁ rm a constructive type of panhumanity by working hard to free us from the provincialism of the mind the sectarianism of ideologies the dishonesty of grandiose posturing and the grip of fear This aspiration also shapes my vision of what a university should look like  a universum that serves the world of today not only as the epistemological site of scientiﬁ c production but also as the epistemophilic yearning for the empowerment that comes with knowledge and sustains our subjectivity I would deﬁ ne this yearning as a radical aspiration to freedom through the understanding of the speciﬁ c conditions and relations of power that are immi nent to our historical locations These conditions include the power that each and every one of us exercises in the everyday network of social relations at both the micro and macro political levels In some ways my interest in the posthuman is directly proportional to the sense of frustration I feel about the human all too human resources and limitations that frame our collective and personal levels of intensity and creativity This is why the issue of subjectivity is so central to this book we need to devise new social ethical and discursive schemes of subject formation to match the profound transformations we are undergoing That means that we need to learn to think differently about ourselves I take the posthuman predicament as an opportunity to empower the pursuit of alternative schemes of thought knowledge and selfrepresentation The posthuman condition urges us to think critically and creatively about who and what we are actually in the process of becoming Chapter 1 PostHumanism Life beyond the Self At the start of it all there is He the classical ideal of Man formulated ﬁ rst by Protagoras as the measure of all things later renewed in the Italian Renaissance as a universal model and represented in Leonardo da Vincis Vitruvian Man see ﬁ gure 11 An ideal of bodily perfection which in keeping with the classical dictum mens sana in corpore sano doubles up as a set of mental discursive and spiritual values Together they uphold a speciﬁ c view of what is human about human ity Moreover they assert with unshakable certainty the almost boundless capacity of humans to pursue their indi vidual and collective perfectibility That iconic image is the emblem of Humanism as a doctrine that combines the bio logical discursive and moral expansion of human capabilities into an idea of teleologically ordained rational progress Faith in the unique selfregulating and intrinsically moral powers of human reason forms an integral part of this highhumanistic creed which was essentially predicated on eighteenth and nineteenthcentury renditions of classical Antiquity and Italian Renaissance ideals This model sets standards not only for individuals but also for their cultures Humanism historically developed into a civilizational model which shaped a certain idea of Europe as coinciding with the universalizing powers of self reﬂ exive reason The mutation of the Humanistic ideal into PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Figure 11 Vitruvian Man 1492 Leonardo da Vinci Source Wikimedia Commons a hegemonic cultural model was canonized by Hegels phi losophy of history This selfaggrandizing vision assumes that Europe is not just a geopolitical location but rather a uni versal attribute of the human mind that can lend its quality to any suitable object This is the view espoused by Edmund Husserl 1970 is his celebrated essay The crisis of European PostHumanism Life beyond the Self sciences which is a passionate defence of the universal powers of reason against the intellectual and moral decline symbolized by the rising threat of European fascism in the 1930s In Husserls view Europe announces itself as the site of origin of critical reason and selfreﬂ exivity both qualities resting on the Humanistic norm Equal only to itself Europe as universal consciousness transcends its speciﬁ city or rather posits the power of transcendence as its distinctive character istic and humanistic universalism as its particularity This makes Eurocentrism into more than just a contingent matter of attitude it is a structural element of our cultural practice which is also embedded in both theory and institutional and pedagogical practices As a civilizational ideal Humanism fuelled the imperial destinies of nineteenthcentury Germany France and supremely Great Britain Davies 1997 23 This Eurocentric paradigm implies the dialectics of self and other and the binary logic of identity and otherness as respec tively the motor for and the cultural logic of universal Human ism Central to this universalistic posture and its binary logic is the notion of difference as pejoration Subjectivity is equated with consciousness universal rationality and self regulating ethical behaviour whereas Otherness is deﬁ ned as its negative and specular counterpart In so far as difference spells inferiority it acquires both essentialist and lethal con notations for people who get branded as others These are the sexualized racialized and naturalized others who are reduced to the less than human status of disposable bodies We are all humans but some of us are just more mortal than others Because their history in Europe and elsewhere has been one of lethal exclusions and fatal disqualiﬁ cations these others raise issues of power and exclusion We need more ethical accountability in dealing with the legacy of Human ism Tony Davies puts it lucidly All Humanisms until now have been imperial They speak of the human in the accents and the interests of a class a sex a race a genome Their embrace suffocates those whom it does not ignore    It is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been com mitted in the name of humanity Davies 1997 141 Indeed but it is also the case unfortunately that many atrocities have been committed in the name of the hatred for humanity as shown by the case of PekkaEric Auvinen in the ﬁ rst vignette in the introduction PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Humanisms restricted notion of what counts as the human is one of the keys to understand how we got to a posthuman turn at all The itinerary is far from simple or predictable Edward Said for instance complicates the picture by intro ducing a postcolonial angle Humanism as protective or even defensive nationalism is    a mixed blessing for its    ideological ferocity and triumphalism although it is sometimes inevitable In a colonial setting for example a revival of the suppressed languages and cultures the attempts at national assertion through cultural tradition and glorious ancestors    are explainable and understandable Said 2004 37 This qualiﬁ cation is crucial in pointing out the importance of where one is actually speaking from Differ ences of location between centres and margins matter greatly especially in relation to the legacy of something as complex and multifaceted as Humanism Complicitous with geno cides and crimes on the one hand supportive of enormous hopes and aspirations to freedom on the other Humanism somehow defeats linear criticism This protean quality is partly responsible for its longevity AntiHumanism Let me put my cards on the table at this early stage of the argument I am none too fond of Humanism or of the idea of the human which it implicitly upholds Antihumanism is so much part of my intellectual and personal genealogy as well as family background that for me the crisis of Human ism is almost a banality Why Politics and philosophy are the main reasons for the glee with which I have always greeted the notion of the historical decline of Humanism with its Eurocentric core and imperial tendencies Of course the historical context has a lot to do with it I came of age intellectually and politically in the tur bulent years after the Second World War when the Humanist ideal came to be questioned quite radically Throughout the 1960s and 1970s an activist brand of antiHumanism was developed by the new social movements and the youth cul tures of the day feminism decolonization and antiracism antinuclear and paciﬁ st movements Chronologically linked PostHumanism Life beyond the Self the babyboomers these social movements produced radical political social theories and new epistemologies They chal lenged the platitudes of Cold War rhetoric with its emphasis on Western democracy liberal individualism and the freedom they allegedly ensured for all Nothing smacks more like a theoretical midlife crisis than to acknowledge ones afﬁ liation to the babyboomers The public image of this generation is not exactly edifying at this point in time Nonetheless truth be said that generation was marked by the traumatic legacy of the many failed political experiments of the twentieth century Fascism and the Holo caust on the one hand Communism and the Gulag on the other strike a blooddrenched balance on the comparative scale of horrors There is a clear generational link between these historical phenomena and the rejection of Humanism in the 1960s and 1970s Let me explain At the levels of their own ideological content these two historical phenomena Fascism and Communism rejected openly or implicitly the basic tenets of European Humanism and betrayed them violently They remain however quite dif ferent as movements in their structures and aims Whereas fascism preached a ruthless departure from the very roots of Enlightenmentbased respect for the autonomy of reason and the moral good socialism pursued a communitarian notion of humanist solidarity Socialist Humanism had been a feature of the European Left since the utopian socialist movements of the eighteenth century Admittedly MarxistLeninism rejected these softheaded aspects of socialist humanism notably the emphasis on the fulﬁ lment of the human beings potential for authenticity as opposed to alienation It offered as an alter native proletarian Humanism also known as the revolu tionary Humanism of the USSR and its ruthless pursuit of universal rational human freedom through and under Communism Two factors contributed to the relative popularity of com munist Humanism in the postwar era The ﬁ rst is the disas trous effects of Fascism upon European social but also intellectual history The period of Fascism and Nazism enacted a major disruption in the history of critical theory in Continen tal Europe in that it destroyed and banned from Europe the PostHumanism Life beyond the Self very schools of thought  notably Marxism psychoanalysis the Frankfurt School and the disruptive charge of Nietzschean genealogy though the case of Nietzsche is admittedly quite complex  which had been central to philosophy in the earlier part of the twentieth century Moreover the Cold War and the opposition of the two geopolitical blocks which followed the end of the Second World War kept Europe split asunder and dichotomized until 1989 and did not facilitate the reimplan tation of those radical theories back into the Continent which had cast them away with such violence and selfdestruction It is signiﬁ cant for instance that most of the authors which Michel Foucault singled out as heralding the philosophical era of critical postmodernity Marx Freud Darwin are the same authors whom the Nazis condemned and burned at the stake in the 1930s The second reason for the popularity of Marxist Humanism is that Communism under the aegis of the USSR played a pivotal role in defeating Fascism and hence to all ends and purposes came out of the Second World War as the winner It follows therefore that the generation that came of age politi cally in 1968 inherited a positive view of Marxist praxis and ideology as a result of socialists and communists opposition to fascism and to the Soviet Unions war effort against Nazism This clashes with the almost epidermic anticommunism of American culture and remains to date a point of great intel lectual tension between Europe and the USA It is sometimes difﬁ cult at the dawn of the third millennium to remember that Communist parties were the single largest emblem of anti fascist resistance throughout Europe They also played a sig niﬁ cant role in national liberation movements throughout the world notably in Africa and Asia André Malrauxs seminal text Mans Fate La condition humaine 1934 bears testimony to both the moral stature and the tragic dimension of Com munism as does in a different era and geopolitical context Nelson Mandelas 1994 life and work Speaking from his position within the United States of America Edward Said adds another signiﬁ cant insight Antihumanism took hold on the United States intellectual scene partly because of widespread revulsion with the Vietnam War Part of that revulsion was the emergence of a resistance move ment to racism imperialism generally and the dryasdust aca PostHumanism Life beyond the Self demic Humanities that had for years represented an apolitical unworldly and oblivious sometimes even manipulative atti tude to the present all the while adamantly extolling the virtues of the past 2004 13 The new Left in the USA throughout the 1960s and 1970s embodied a militant brand of radical antihumanism which was posited in opposition not only to the Liberal majority but also to the Marxist Humanism of the traditional Left I am fully aware of the fact that the notion that Marxism by now socially coded as an inhumane and violent ideology may actually be a Humanism will shock the younger genera tions and all who are unschooled in Continental philosophy Sufﬁ ce it however to think of the emphasis that philosophers of the calibre of Sartre and de Beauvoir placed on Humanism as a secular tool of critical analysis to see how the argument may have shaped up Existentialism stressed Humanist con science as the source of both moral responsibility and politi cal freedom France occupies a very special position in the genealogy of antihumanist critical theory The prestige of French intellectu als was linked not only to the formidable educational structure of that country but also to contextual considerations Fore most among them is the high moral stature of France at the end of the Second World War thanks to the antiNazi resist ance of Charles de Gaulle French intellectuals continued accordingly to enjoy a very high status especially in compari son with the wasteland that was postwar Germany Hence the huge international reputation of Sartre and de Beauvoir but also Aron Mauriac Camus and Malraux Tony Judt sums it up succinctly 2005 210 Despite Frances shattering defeat in 1940 its humiliating sub jugation under four years of German occupation the moral ambiguity and worse of Marshall Petains Vichy regime and the countrys embarrassing subordination to the US and Britain in the international diplomacy of the postwar years French culture became once again the centre of international attention French intellectuals acquired a special international signiﬁ cance as spokesmen for the age and the tenor of French political arguments epitomised the ideological rent in the world at large Once more  and for the last time  Paris was the capital of Europe PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Throughout the postwar years Paris continued to function as a magnet that attracted and engendered all sorts of critical thinkers For example Alexandr Solzhenitsyns The Gulag Archipelago was ﬁ rst published in France in the 1970s after being smuggled out of the USSR in samizdat form It was out of his Parisian retreat that the Ayatollah Khomeini led the Iranian revolution of 1979 which installed the worlds ﬁ rst Islamist government In some ways the French context of those days was open to all sorts of radical political movements As a matter of fact so many critical schools of thought ﬂ ourished on the Left and Right Bank in that period that French philoso phy became almost synonymous with theory itself with mixed longterm consequences as we shall see in chapter 4 Up until the 1960s philosophical reason had escaped rela tively unscathed from the question of its responsibilities in perpetuating historical models of domination and exclusion Both Sartre and de Beauvoir inﬂ uenced by Marxist theories of alienation and ideology did connect the triumph of reason with the might of dominant powers thus disclosing the complicity between philosophical ratio and reallife social practices of injustice They continued however to defend a universalist idea of reason and to rely on a dialectical model for the resolu tion of these contradictions This methodological approach while being critical of hegemonic models of violent appropria tion and consumption of the others also deﬁ ned the task of philosophy as a privileged and culturally hegemonic tool of political analysis With Sartre and de Beauvoir the image of the philosopherking is built into the general picture albeit in a critical mode As a critic of ideology and the conscience of the oppressed the philosopher is a thinking human being who continues to pursue grand theoretical systems and over arching truths Sartre and de Beauvoir consider humanistic universalism as the distinctive trait of Western culture ie its speciﬁ c form of particularism They use the conceptual tools provided by Humanism to precipitate a confrontation of phi losophy with its own historical responsibilities and conceptual powerbrokering This humanistic universalism coupled with the social con structivist emphasis on the manmade and historically variable nature of social inequalities lays the grounds for a robust political ontology For instance de Beauvoirs emancipatory PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Figure 12 New Vitruvian Woman Source Friedrich SaurerScience Photo Library feminism builds on the Humanist principle that Woman is the measure of all things female see ﬁ gure 12 and that to account for herself the feminist philosopher needs to take into account the situation of all women This creates on the theoretical level a productive synthesis of self and others Politically the Vitruvian female forged a bond of solidarity between one and the many which in the hands of the second feminist wave in the 1960s was to grow into the principle of political sisterhood This posits a common grounding among women taking beingwomenintheworld as the starting PostHumanism Life beyond the Self point for all critical reﬂ ection and jointly articulated political praxis Humanist feminism introduced a new brand of material ism of the embodied and embedded kind Braidotti 1991 The cornerstone of this theoretical innovation is a speciﬁ c brand of situated epistemology Haraway 1988 which evolved from the practice of the politics of locations Rich 1987 and infused standpoint feminist theory and the subsequent debates with postmodernist feminism throughout the 1990s Harding 1991 The theoretical premise of humanist feminism is a mate rialist notion of embodiment that spells the premises of new and more accurate analyses of power These are based on the radical critique of masculinist universalism but are still depend ent on a form of activist and equalityminded Humanism Feminist theory and practice worked faster and more efﬁ  ciently than most social movements of the 1970s It developed original tools and methods of analysis that allowed for more incisive accounts of how power works Feminists also explicitly targeted the masculinism and the sexist habits of the allegedly revolutionary Left and denounced them as contradictory with their ideology as well as intrinsically offensive Within the mainstream Left however a new generation of postwar thinkers had other priorities They rebelled against the high moral status of postwar European Communist parties in Western Europe as well as in the Soviet empire This had resulted in an authoritarian hold over the interpretation of Marxist texts and their key philosophical concepts The new forms of philosophical radicalism developed in France and throughout Europe in the late 1960s expressed a vocal critique of the dogmatic structure of Communist thought and practice They included a critique of the political alliance between phi losophers like Sartre and de Beauvoir and the Communist Left1 which lasted at least until the Hungarian insurrection of 1956 In response to the dogma and the violence of Communism the generation of 1968 appealed directly to the subversive potential of the texts of Marx so as to recover their antiinstitutional roots Their radicalism was expressed in terms of a critique of Communist Party PostHumanism Life beyond the Self the institutions that embodied Marxist dogma Antihumanism emerged as the rallying cry of this genera tion of radical thinkers who later were to became worldfamous as the poststructuralist generation In fact they were post communists avant la lettre They stepped out of the dialectical oppositional thinking and developed a third way to deal with changing understandings of human subjectivity By the time Michel Foucault published his groundbreaking critique of Humanism in The Order of Things 1970 the question of what if anything was the idea of the human was circulating in the radical discourses of the time and had set the anti humanist agenda for an array of political groups The death of Man announced by Foucault formalizes an epistemologi cal and moral crisis that goes beyond binary oppositions and cuts across the different poles of the political spectrum What is targeted is the implicit Humanism of Marxism more spe ciﬁ cally the humanistic arrogance of continuing to place Man at the centre of world history Even Marxism under the cover of a master theory of historical materialism continued to deﬁ ne the subject of European thought as unitary and hege monic and to assign him the gender is no coincidence a royal place as the motor of human history Antihumanism consists in delinking the human agent from this universalistic posture calling him to task so to speak on the concrete actions he is enacting Different and sharper power relations emerge once this formerly dominant subject is freed from his delusions of grandeur and is no longer allegedly in charge of historical progress The radical thinkers of the post1968 generation rejected Humanism both in its classical and its socialist versions The Vitruvian ideal of Man as the standard of both perfection and perfectibility as shown in ﬁ gure 11 was literally pulled down from his pedestal and deconstructed This humanistic ideal constituted in fact the core of a liberal individualistic view of the subject which deﬁ ned perfectibility in terms of autonomy and selfdetermination These are precisely the qualiﬁ cations the poststructuralists objected to It turned out that this Man far from being the canon of perfect proportions spelling out a universalistic ideal that by PostHumanism Life beyond the Self now had reached the status of a natural law was in fact a historical construct and as such contingent as to values and locations Individualism is not an intrinsic part of human nature as liberal thinkers are prone to believe but rather a historically and culturally speciﬁ c discursive formation one which moreover is becoming increasingly problematic The deconstructive brand of social constructivism introduced by poststructuralist thinkers like Jacques Derrida 2001a also contributed to a radical revision of the Humanist tenets An entire philosophical generation called for insubordination from received Humanist ideas of human nature Feminists like Luce Irigaray 1985a 1985b pointed out that the allegedly abstract ideal of Man as a symbol of clas sical Humanity is very much a male of the species it is a he Moreover he is white European handsome and ablebodied of his sexuality nothing much can be guessed though plenty of speculation surrounds that of its painter Leonardo da Vinci What this ideal model may have in common with the statistical average of most members of the species and the civilization he is supposed to represent is a very good question indeed Feminist critiques of patriarchal posturing through abstract masculinity Hartsock 1987 and triumphant white ness hooks 1981 Ware 1992 argued that this Humanist universalism is objectionable not only on epistemological but also on ethical and political grounds Anticolonial thinkers adopted a similar critical stance by questioning the primacy of whiteness in the Vitruvian ideal as the aesthetic canon of beauty see ﬁ gure 12 Re grounding such lofty claims onto the history of colonialism antiracist and postcolonial thinkers explicitly questioned the relevance of the Humanistic ideal in view of the obvious contradictions imposed by its Eurocentric assumptions but at the same time they did not entirely cast it aside They held the Europeans accountable for the uses and abuses of this ideal by looking at colonial history and the violent domina tion of other cultures but still upheld its basic premises Frantz Fanon for instance wanted to rescue Humanism from its European perpetuators arguing that we have betrayed and misused the humanist ideal As Sartre put it in his preface to Fanons The Wretched of the Earth 1963 7 the yellow and black voices still spoke of our Humanism but only to PostHumanism Life beyond the Self reproach us with our inhumanity Postcolonial thought asserts that if Humanism has a future at all it has to come from outside the Western world and bypass the limitations of Eurocentrism By extension the claim to universality by scientiﬁ c rationality is challenged on both epistemological and political grounds Spivak 1999 Said 2004 all knowl edge claims being expressions of Western culture and of its drive to mastery French poststructuralist philosophers pursued the same postcolonial aim through different routes and means2 They argued that in the aftermath of colonialism Auschwitz Hiro shima and the Gulag  to mention but a few of the horrors of modern history  we Europeans need to develop a critique of Europes delusion of grandeur in positing ourselves as the moral guardian of the world and as the motor of human evolution Thus the philosophical generation of the 1970s that proclaimed the death of Man was antifascist post communist postcolonial and posthumanist in a variety of different combinations of the terms They led to the rejection of the classical deﬁ nition of European identity in terms of Humanism rationality and the universal The feminist phi losophies of sexual difference3 through the spectrum of the critique of dominant masculinity also stressed the ethno centric nature of European claims to universalism They advocated the need to open it up to the others within Kristeva 1991 in such a way as to relocate diversity and multiple belongings to a central position as a structural com ponent of European subjectivity Antihumanism is consequently an important source for posthuman thought It is by no means the only one nor is the connection between antihumanism and the posthuman logically necessary or historically inevitable And yet it turned out to be so for my own work although this story is still unﬁ nished and in some ways as I will argue in the next section my relation to Humanism remains unresolved 2 This line is pursued in philosophy by Deleuzes rejection of the transcendental vision of the subject 1994 Irigarays decentring of phallogocentrism 1985a 1985b Foucaults critique of Humanism 1977 and Derridas deconstruction of Eurocentrism 1992 3 See for instance Irigaray 1993 Cixous 1997 and Braidotti 1991 PostHumanism Life beyond the Self The Death of Man the Deconstruction of Woman As indicated in the genealogical itinerary I have just sketched antihumanism is one of the historical and theoretical paths that can lead to the posthuman I owe my antihumanism to my beloved post1968 teachers some of whom were amazing philosophers whose legacy I continue to respect and admire Foucault Irigaray and Deleuze especially The human of Humanism is neither an ideal nor an objective statistical average or middle ground It rather spells out a systematized standard of recognizability  of Sameness  by which all others can be assessed regulated and allotted to a designated social location The human is a normative convention which does not make it inherently negative just highly regulatory and hence instru mental to practices of exclusion and discrimination The human norm stands for normality normalcy and normativity It func tions by transposing a speciﬁ c mode of being human into a generalized standard which acquires transcendent values as the human from male to masculine and onto human as the uni versalized format of humanity This standard is posited as categorically and qualitatively distinct from the sexualized racialized naturalized others and also in opposition to the technological artefact The human is a historical construct that became a social convention about human nature My antihumanism leads me to object to the unitary subject of Humanism including its socialist variables and to replace it with a more complex and relational subject framed by embodiment sexuality affectivity empathy and desire as core qualities Equally central to this approach is the insight I learned from Foucault on power as both a restrictive potes tas and productive potentia force This means that power formations not only function at the material level but are also expressed in systems of theoretical and cultural representa tion political and normative narratives and social modes of identiﬁ cation These are neither coherent nor rational and their makeshift nature is instrumental to their hegemonic force The awareness of the instability and the lack of coher ence of the narratives that compose the social structures and relations far from resulting in a suspension of political and PostHumanism Life beyond the Self moral action become the starting point to elaborate new forms of resistance suited to the polycentric and dynamic structure of contemporary power Patton 2000 This engen ders a pragmatic form of micropolitics that reﬂ ects the complex and nomadic nature of contemporary social systems and of the subjects that inhabit them If power is complex scattered and productive so must be our resistance to it Once this deconstructive move is activated both the standard notion of Man and his second sex Woman are challenged in terms of their internal complexities This clearly affects the task and the methods status of theory Discourse as Michel Foucault argues in Discipline and Punish 1977 is about the political currency that is attributed to certain meanings or systems of meaning in such a way as to invest them with scientiﬁ c legitimacy there is nothing neutral or given about it Thus a critical materialist link is established between scientiﬁ c truth discursive currency and power relations This approach of discourse analysis primarily aims at dislodging the belief in the natural founda tions of socially coded and enforced differences and of the systems of scientiﬁ c validity ethical values and representation which they support Coward and Ellis 19774 Feminist antiHumanism also known as postmodernist feminism rejected the unitary identities indexed on that Eurocentric and normative humanist ideal of Man Braid otti 2002 It went further however and argued that it is impossible to speak in one uniﬁ ed voice about women natives and other marginal subjects The emphasis falls instead on issues of diversity and differences among them and on the internal fractures of each category In this respect anti humanism rejects the dialectical scheme of thought where difference or otherness played a constitutive role marking off the sexualized other woman the racialized other the native and the naturalized other animals the environment or earth These others were constitutive in that they fulﬁ lled a mirror 4 This approach has also been adopted by intersectional analysis which argues for the methodological parallelism of gender race class and sexual factors without ﬂ attening out any differences between them but rather investing politically the question of their complex interaction Crenshaw 1995 PostHumanism Life beyond the Self function that conﬁ rmed the Same in His superior position Braidotti 2006 This political economy of difference resulted in passing off entire categories of human beings as devalued and therefore disposable others to be different from came to mean to be less than The dominant norm of the subject was positioned at the pinnacle of a hierarchical scale that rewarded the ideal of zerodegree of difference5 This is the former Man of classical Humanism The negative dialectical processes of sexualization raciali zation and naturalization of those who are marginalized or excluded have another important implication they result in the active production of halftruths or forms of partial knowledge about these others Dialectical and pejorative oth erness induces structural ignorance about those who by being others are posited as the outside of major categorical divides in the attribution of Humanity Paul Gilroy 2010 refers to this phenomenon as agnatology or enforced and structural ignorance This is one of the paradoxical effects of the alleged universalist reach of humanist knowledge The bellicose dismissiveness of other cultures and civiliza tions is what Edward Said criticizes as selfpuffery not humanism and certainly not enlightened criticism 2004 27 The reduction to subhuman status of nonWestern others is a constitutive source of ignorance falsity and bad conscious ness for the dominant subject who is responsible for their epistemic as well as social dehumanization These radical critiques of humanistic arrogance from femi nist and postcolonial theory are not merely negative because they propose new alternative ways to look at the human from a more inclusive and diverse angle They also offer signiﬁ cant and innovative insights into the image of thought that is implicitly conveyed by the humanistic vision of Man as the measure of all things standardbearer of the human Thus they further the analysis of power by developing the 5 Deleuze calls it the Majority subject or the Molar centre of being Deleuze and Guattari 1987 Irigaray calls it the Same or the hyperinﬂ ated falsely universal He Irigaray 1985b 1993 whereas Hill Collins calls to account the white and Eurocentric bias of this particular subject of humanistic knowledge 1991 PostHumanism Life beyond the Self with masculinism racism white superiority the dogma of scientiﬁ c reason and other socially supported systems of dom inant values Having practically grown up with theories about the death of God Nietzsche the end of Man Foucault and the decline of ideologies Fukuyama it took me a while to realize that actually one touches humanism at ones own risk and peril The antihumanist position is certainly not free of contradic tions As Badmington wisely reminds us Apocalyptic accounts of the end of man    ignore Humanisms capacity for regeneration and quite literally recapitulation 2003 11 The Vitruvian Man rises over and over again from his ashes con tinues to uphold universal standards and to exercise a fatal attraction The thought did occur to me as I was listening to Diamanda Galas Plague Mass 1991 for the victims of AIDS it is one thing to loudly announce an antihumanist stance quite another to act accordingly with a modicum of consistency Anti humanism is a position fraught with such contradictions that the more one tries to overcome them the more slippery it gets Not only do antihumanists often end up espousing humanist ideals  freedom being my favourite one  but also in some ways the work of critical thought is supported by intrinsic humanist discursive values Soper 1986 Somehow neither humanism nor antihumanism is adequate to the task The best example of the intrinsic contradictions generated by the antihumanist stance is emancipation and progressive politics in general which I consider one of the most valuable aspects of the humanistic tradition and its most enduring legacy Across the political spectrum Humanism has supported on the liberal side individualism autonomy responsibility and selfdetermination Todorov 2002 On the more radical front it has promoted solidarity communitybonding social justice and principles of equality Profoundly secular in orientation Humanism promotes respect for science and culture against the authority of holy texts and religious dogma It also con tains an adventurous element a curiositydriven yearning for discovery and a projectoriented approach that is extremely valuable in its pragmatism These principles are so deeply PostHumanism Life beyond the Self entrenched in our habits of thought that it is difﬁ cult to leave them behind altogether And why should we Antihumanism criticizes the implicit assumptions about the human subject that are upheld by the humanist image of Man but this does not amount to a com plete rejection For me it is impossible both intellectually and ethically to disengage the positive elements of Humanism from their problematic counterparts individualism breeds egotism and selfcentredness selfdetermination can turn to arrogance and domination and science is not free from its own dogmatic tendencies The difﬁ culties inherent in trying to overcome Humanism as an intellectual tradition a normative frame and an institutionalized practice lie at the core of the deconstruc tive approach to the posthuman Derrida 2001a opened this discussion by pointing out the violence implicit in the assigna tion of meaning His followers pressed the case further the assertion that Humanism can be decisively left behind ironi cally subscribes to a basic humanist assumption with regard to volition and agency as if the end of Humanism might be subjected to human control as if we bear the capacity to erase the traces of Humanism from either the present or an imagined future Peterson 2011 128 The emphasis falls therefore on the difﬁ culty of erasing the trace of the epistemic violence by which a nonhumanist position might be carved out of the institutions of Humanism The acknowledgment of epistemic violence goes hand in hand with the recognition of the reallife violence which was and still is practised against nonhuman animals and the dehumanized social and political others of the humanist norm In this deconstructive tradi tion Cary Wolfe 2010b is especially interesting as he attempts to strike a new position that combines sensitivity to epistemic and wordhistorical violence with a distinctly trans humanist faith Bostrom 2005 in the potential of the post human condition as conducive to human enhancement I have great respect for deconstruction but also some impatience with the limitations of its linguistic frame of refer ence I prefer to take a more materialist route to deal with the complexities of the posthuman as a key feature of our historicity That road too is fraught with perils as we shall see in the next section PostHumanism Life beyond the Self As a progressive political creed Humanism bears a privileged relation to two other interlocked ideas human emancipation in the pursuit of equality and secularism through rational governance These two premises emerge from the concept of Humanism just like the classical goddess Athena is raised from Zeus head fully clad and armed for battle As John Gray 2002 xiii argued Humanism is the transformation of the Christian doctrine of salvation into a project of uni versal human emancipation The idea of progress is a secular version of the Christian belief in providence That is why among the ancient pagans it was unknown It is not surpris ing therefore that one of the sideeffects of the decline of Humanism is the rise of the postsecular condition Braidotti 2008 Habermas 2008 If the death of Man proved to be a bit of a hasty statement that of God turned out to be positively delusional The ﬁ rst cracks in the ediﬁ ce of selfassured secularity appeared at the end of the 1970s As the revolutionary zeal cooled off and social movements started to dissipate conform or mutate former militant agnostics joined a wave of conversions to a variety of conventional monotheistic or imported Eastern religions This turn of events raised serious doubts as to the future of secularity The doubt crept into the collective and individual mind how secular are we  feminists antiracists postcolonialists environmentalists etc  really The doubt was even sharper for intellectual activists Science is intrinsically secular secularity being a key tenet of Humanism alongside universalism the unitary subject and the primacy of rationality Science itself however in spite of its secular foundations is far from immune from its own forms of dogmatism Freud was one of the ﬁ rst critical think ers to warn us against the fanatical atheism of the supporters of scientiﬁ c reason In The Future of an Illusion 1928 Freud compares different forms of rigid dogmatism classifying rationalist scientism alongside religion as a source of supersti tious belief a position best illustrated today by the extremism with which Richard Dawkins defends his atheist faith Dawkins 1976 Moreover the muchcelebrated objectivity PostHumanism Life beyond the Self of science has also been shown to be quite ﬂ awed The uses and abuses of scientiﬁ c experimentation under Fascism and in the colonial era prove that science is not immunized against nationalist racist and hegemonic discourses and practices Any claim to scientiﬁ c purity objectivity and autonomy needs therefore to be ﬁ rmly resisted Where does that leave Human ism and its antihumanist critics Secularity is one of the pillars of Western Humanism thus an instinctive form of aversion to religion and to the church is historically an integral aspect of emancipatory politics The socialist humanist tradition which was so central to the European Left and the womens movements in Europe since the eighteenth century is justiﬁ ed in claiming to be secular in the narrow sense of the term to be agnostic if not atheist and to descend from the Enlightenment critique of religious dogma and clerical authority Like other emancipatory phi losophies and political practices the feminist struggle for womens rights in Europe has historically built on secular foundations The lasting inﬂ uence exercised by existentialist feminism de Beauvoir 1973 and Marxist or socialist femi nisms6 on the second feminist wave may also account for the perpetuation of this position As the secular and rebellious daughters of the Enlightenment European feminists were raised in rational argumentation and detached selfirony The feminist beliefsystem is accordingly civic not theistic and viscerally opposed to authoritarianism and orthodoxy Femi nist politics is also and at the same time a doubleedged vision Kelly 1979 that combines rational arguments with political passions and creates alternative social blueprints and value systems However proud twentiethcentury feminism may be of its secular roots it is nonetheless the case that it has historically produced various alternative spiritual practices alongside and often in antagonism to the mainstream political secularist line Major writers in the radical feminist tradition of the second American wave notably Audre Lorde 1984 Alice 6 Central ﬁ gures in this tradition are Firestone 1970 Rowbotham 1973 Mitchell 1974 Barrett 1980 Davis 1981 Coward 1983 and Delphy 1984 PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Walker 1984 and Adrienne Rich 1987 acknowledged the importance of the spiritual dimension of womens struggle for equality and symbolic recognition The work of Mary Daly 1973 Schussler Fiorenza 1983 and Luce Irigaray 1993 to name but a few highlights a speciﬁ c feminist tradi tion of nonmalecentred spiritual and religious practices Feminist theology in the Christian Keller 1998 Wadud 1999 Muslim Tayyab 1998 and Judaic Adler 1998 tra ditions produced wellestablished communities of both criti cal resistance and afﬁ rmation of creative alternatives The call for new rituals and ceremonies makes the fortune of the witches movement currently best exempliﬁ ed by Starhawk 1999 and reclaimed among others by the epistemologist Stengers 1997 Neopagan elements have also emerged in technologically mediated cyberculture producing various brands of posthuman technoasceticism Halberstam and Livingston 1995 Braidotti 2002 Black and postcolonial theories have never been loudly secular In the very religious context of the USA African American womens literature is ﬁ lled with PostHumanism Life beyond the Self The notion that ﬂ atly and hastily equates secularity and secularism with womens emancipation emerges therefore as problematic As Joan Scott cogently argues 2007 this notion can be easily challenged by contradictory historical evidence If we take for instance the French Revolution as the histori cal point of origin of European secularism there is no evi dence that a concern for the equal status of women was a priority for those who acted to separate church from state High secularism is essentially a political doctrine of the sepa ration of powers which was even historically consolidated in Europe and is still prominent in political theory today British Humanist Association 2007 This tradition of secularism however introduces a polarization between religion and citi zenship which is socially enacted in a new partition between a private belief system and the public political sphere This publicprivate distinction is thoroughly gendered Histori cally women in Europe have been assigned to both the private domain and to the realm of faith and religion Humanism being white Mans burden This traditional attribution of religious faith to women stands in the way of granting them full political citizenship European women were encouraged to engage in religious activity rather than to participate in public affairs This is not only a source of social marginaliza tion but also a dubious privilege in view of the entrenched sexism of monotheistic religions and their shared conviction of the necessity to exclude women from the ministry and the administration of sacred functions Secularity therefore rein forced the distinction between emotions or unreason includ ing faith and rational judgement In this polarized scheme women were assigned to the pole of unreason passions and emotions including religion and these factors combined to keep them in the private sphere Thus secularism actually reenforces the oppression of women and their exclusion from the public sphere of rational citizenship and politics The fact that idealized secularism in European political history does not guarantee that women were considered the political equals of men opens a series of critical questions according to Joan Scott What are European feminists to make of the fact that both logically and historically equality within the secular state does not guarantee the respect for difference let alone diversity PostHumanism Life beyond the Self the aftermath of decades of antihumanist critical theory which generated innovative feminist postcolonial and envi ronmental insights Complexity becomes the key word as it is clear that one single narrative does not sufﬁ ce to account for secularity as an unﬁ nished project and its relationship to Humanism and emancipatory politics A postsecular approach posited on ﬁ rm antihumanist grounds makes manifest the previously unacceptable notion that rational agency and political subjectivity can actually be conveyed through and supported by religious piety and may even involve signiﬁ cant amounts of spirituality Belief systems and their rituals are perhaps not incompatible with critical thought and practices of citizenship Simone de Beauvoir would be distressed at the very suggestion of such a possibility Let me approach the limits of the feminist secular position from another angle My monistic philosophy of becomings rests on the idea that matter including the speciﬁ c slice of matter that is human embodiment is intelligent and self organizing This means that matter is not dialectically opposed to culture nor to technological mediation but continuous with them This produces a different scheme of emancipation and a nondialectical politics of human liberation This posi tion has another important corollary namely that political agency need not be critical in the negative sense of opposi tional and thus may not be aimed solely or primarily at the production of countersubjectivities Subjectivity is rather a process of autopoiesis or selfstyling which involves complex and continuous negotiations with dominant norms and values and hence also multiple forms of accountability Braidotti 2006 This processoriented political ontology can accom modate a postsecular turn a position that is also defended within feminism by a variety of thinkers such as Harding 2000 and Mahmood 2005 The double challenge of linking political subjectivity to religious agency and of disen gaging both from oppositional consciousness and from cri tique deﬁ ned as negativity is one of the main issues raised by the posthumanist condition Things around Humanism however are always more complex than one expects them to be The return of religion in the public sphere and the strident tone reached by the PostHumanism Life beyond the Self global public debate on the clash of civilizations not to speak of the permanent state of war on terror that ensued from this context took many antihumanists by surprise To speak of a return of religion is inappropriate as it suggests a regressive movement What we are experiencing at present is a more complicated situation The crisis of secularism deﬁ ned as the essentialist belief in the axioms of secularity is a phenomenon that takes place within the social and political horizon of late globalized postmodernity not in premodern times It is of the here and now Moreover it spreads across all religions amidst both second and third generation descend ants of Muslim immigrants and amidst bornagain funda mentalist Christians and by Hindi Hebrew and others This is the paradoxical and violent global context where the posture of Western exceptionalism has taken the form of selfaggrandizing praise of the Enlightenment Humanist legacy This claim to an exceptional cultural status fore grounds the emancipation of women gays and lesbians as the deﬁ ning feature of the West coupled with extensive geo political armed interventions against the rest Humanism has once again become enlisted in a civilizational crusade Simul taneously overestimated in its emancipatory historical role and manipulated for xenophobic purposes by populist politi cians across Europe Humanism may need to be rescued from these oversimpliﬁ cations and violent abuses I wonder there fore whether nowadays one can continue to uphold a simple antihumanist position Is a residual form of Humanism inev itable intellectually politically and methodologically after all If the new belligerent discourses about the alleged supe riority of the West are expressed in terms of the legacy of secular Humanism while the most vehement opposition to them takes the form of postsecular practices of politicized religion where can an antihumanist position rest To be simply secular would be complicitous with neocolonial Western supremacist positions while rejecting the Enlighten ment legacy would be inherently contradictory for any critical project The vicious circle is stiﬂ ing It is out of contradictions of this magnitude that the seem ingly endless polemic between Humanism and antihuman ism reaches a deadend This position is not only unproductive it also actively prevents an adequate reading of our immediate PostHumanism Life beyond the Self context Leaving behind the tensions that surround Human ism and its selfcontradictory refutation is now a priority Another option becomes increasingly desirable and necessary posthumanism as a move beyond these lethal binaries Let us turn to it next The Posthuman Challenge Posthumanism is the historical moment that marks the end of the opposition between Humanism and antihumanism and traces a different discursive framework looking more afﬁ rmatively towards new alternatives The starting point for me is the antihumanist death of WoMan which marks the decline of some of the fundamental premises of the Enlighten ment namely the progress of mankind through a self regulatory and teleological ordained use of reason and of secular scientiﬁ c rationality allegedly aimed at the perfect ibility of Man The posthumanist perspective rests on the assumption of the historical decline of Humanism but goes further in exploring alternatives without sinking into the rhetoric of the crisis of Man It works instead towards elabo rating alternative ways of conceptualizing the human subject I will emphasize the priority of the issue of posthuman sub jectivity throughout this book The crisis of Humanism means that the structural others of the modern humanistic subject reemerge with a vengeance in postmodernity Braidotti 2002 It is a historical fact that the great emancipatory movements of postmodernity are driven and fuelled by the resurgent others the womens rights movement the antiracism and decolonization move ments the antinuclear and proenvironment movements are the voices of the structural Others of modernity They inevi tably mark the crisis of the former humanist centre or domi nant subjectposition and are not merely antihumanist but move beyond it to an altogether novel posthuman project These social and political movements are simultaneously the symptom of the crisis of the subject and for conservatives even its cause and also the expression of positive proactive alternatives In the language of my nomadic theory Braidotti 2011a 2011b they express both the crisis of the majority PostHumanism Life beyond the Self and the patterns of becoming of the minorities The challenge for critical theory consists in being able to tell the difference between these different ﬂ ows of mutation In other words the posthumanist position I am defending builds on the antihumanist legacy more speciﬁ cally on the epistemological and political foundations of the post structuralist generation and moves further The alternative views about the human and the new formations of subjectiv ity that have emerged from the radical epistemologies of Continental philosophy in the last thirty years do not merely oppose Humanism but create other visions of the self Sexual ized racialized and naturalized differences far from being the categorical boundarykeepers of the subject of Humanism have evolved into fully ﬂ edged alternative models of the human subject The extent to which they bring about the displacement of the human will become even clearer in the next chapter which analyses the postanthropocentric turn For now I want to emphasize this shift away from anti Humanism towards an afﬁ rmative posthuman position and examine critically some of its components I see three major strands in contemporary posthuman thought the ﬁ rst comes from moral philosophy and develops a reactive form of the posthuman the second from science and technology studies enforces an analytic form of the posthu man and the third from my own tradition of antihumanist philosophies of subjectivity proposes a critical posthumanism Let us look at each of these in turn The reactive approach to the posthuman is defended both conceptually and politically by contemporary liberal thinkers like Martha Nussbaum 1999 2010 She develops a thorough contemporary defence of Humanism as the guarantee of democracy freedom and the respect for human dignity and rejects the very idea of a crisis of European Humanism let alone the possibility of its historical decline Nussbaum does acknowledge the challenges presented by contemporary tech nologydriven global economies but responds to them by re asserting classical humanist ideals and progressive liberal politics She defends the need for universal humanistic values as a remedy for the fragmentation and the relativistic drift of our times which is the result of globalization itself Human istic cosmopolitan universalism is also presented as an anti PostHumanism Life beyond the Self dote against nationalism and ethnocentrism which plague the contemporary world and to the prevailing American attitude of ignorance of the rest of the world Central to the reactive or negative posthumanism of Nuss baum is the idea that one of the effects of globalization is a sort of recontextualization induced by the market economy This produces a new sense of interconnection which in turn calls for a neohumanist ethics For Nussbaum abstract uni versalism is the only stance that is capable of providing solid foundations for moral values such as compassion and respect for others which she ﬁ rmly attaches to the tradition of Amer ican liberal individualism I am very happy that Nussbaum stresses the importance of subjectivity but less happy about the fact that she reattaches it to a universalistic belief in individualism ﬁ xed identities steady locations and moral ties that bind In other words Nussbaum rejects the insights of the radical antihumanist philosophies of the last thirty years Notably she embraces universalism over and against the feminist and postcolonial insights about the importance of the politics of location and careful grounding in geopolitical terms By embracing disembedded universalism Nussbaum ends up being paradoxically parochial in her vision of what counts as the human Bhabha 1996a There is no room for experimenting with new models of the self for Nussbaum the posthuman condition can be solved by restoring a humanist vision of the subject As we shall see in the next section whereas Nussbaum ﬁ lls the ethical vacuum of the globalized world with classical Humanistic norms critical posthumanists take the experimental path They attempt to devise renewed claims to community and belonging by sin gular subjects who have taken critical distance from humanist individualism A second signiﬁ cant posthuman development comes from science and technology studies This contemporary interdisciplinary ﬁ eld raises crucial ethical and conceptual questions about the status of the human but is generally reluctant to undertake a full study of their implications for a theory of subjectivity The inﬂ uence of Bruno Latours anti epistemology and antisubjectivity position accounts partly for this reluctance Concretely it results in parallel and non PostHumanism Life beyond the Self communicating lines of posthuman enquiry A new segrega tion of knowledge is produced along the dividing lines of the two cultures the Humanities and the Sciences which I will discuss in depth in chapter 4 For now let me stress that there is a posthuman agreement that contemporary science and biotechnologies affect the very ﬁ bre and structure of the living and have altered dramatically our understanding of what counts as the basic frame of refer ence for the human today Technological intervention upon all living matter creates a negative unity and mutual depend ence among humans and other species The Human Genome Project for instance uniﬁ es all the human species on the basis of a thorough grasp of our genetic structure This point of consensus however generates diverging paths of enquiry The Humanities continue to ask the question of the episte mological and political implications of the posthuman predicament for our understanding of the human subject They also raise deep anxieties both about the moral status of the human and express the political desire to resist commer cially owned and proﬁ tminded abuses of the new genetic knowhow Contemporary science and technology studies on the other hand adopt a different agenda They have developed an analytic form of posthuman theory For instance Franklin Lury and Stacey working within a sociocultural frame of reference refer to the technologically mediated world of today as panhumanity 2000 26 This indicates a global sense of interconnection among all humans but also between the human and the nonhuman environment including the urban social and political which creates a web of intricate interdependences This new panhumanity is paradoxical in two ways ﬁ rstly because a great deal of its interconnections are negative and based on a shared sense of vulnerability and fear of imminent catastrophes and secondly because this new global proximity does not always breed tolerance and peaceful coexistence on the contrary forms of xenophobic rejection of otherness and increasing armed violence are key features of our times as I will argue in chapter 3 Another relevant example of the same analytic posthuman thought within the disciplinary ﬁ eld of science studies is the work of sociologist Nicholas Rose 2007 He has written PostHumanism Life beyond the Self eloquently about the new forms of biosociality and bio citizenship that are emerging from the shared recognition of the biopolitical nature of contemporary subjectivity Resting on a Foucauldian understanding of how biopolitical man agement of Life deﬁ nes advanced capitalist economies today Rose has developed an effective empirically grounded analy sis of the dilemmas of the posthuman condition This posthu man analytic frame advocates a Foucauldian brand of neoKantian normativity I ﬁ nd this position quite helpful also because it defends a vision of the subject as a relational process with reference to the last phase of Foucaults work Foucault 1978 1985 1986 As I will argue in detail in the next chapter however the return to a notion of Kantian moral responsibility reinstates the individual at the core of the debate This is not compatible with the Foucauldian process ontology and creates both theoretical and practical contradictions that defeat the stated purpose of developing a posthuman approach Another signiﬁ cant case for analytic posthumanism is advocated by PeterPaul Verbeek 2011 Starting from the recognition of the intimate and productive association between human subjects and technological artefacts as well as the theoretical impossibility of keeping them apart Verbeek hints at the need for a postanthropological turn that links humans to nonhumans but he is also very careful not to trespass certain limits His analytic form of posthumanism is immediately qualiﬁ ed by a profoundly humanist and thus normative approach to technology itself Verbeeks main argument is that technologies contribute actively to how humans do ethics 2011 5 a revised and updated form of humanist ethics gets superimposed on posthumanist technologies In order to defend the humanist principle at the heart of contemporary technologies Verbeek emphasizes the moral nature of technological tools as agents that can guide human decision making on normative issues He also introduces multiple forms of machinic intentionality all of them indexed on nonhuman forms of moral consciousness Only by taking seriously the morality of things argues Verbeek can we hope to integrate our technology into the wider social community and bring a posthuman brand of Humanism into the twenty PostHumanism Life beyond the Self ﬁ rst century This results in shifting the location of traditional moral intentionality from autonomous transcendental con sciousness to the technological artefacts themselves The analytic posthumanism of science and technology studies is one of the most important elements of the contem porary posthuman landscape In terms of critical theories of the subject which is the focus of my position however this position falls wide of the mark because it introduces selected segments of humanistic values without addressing the contra dictions engendered by such a grafting exercise The pride in technological achievements and in the wealth that comes with them must not prevent us from seeing the great contradictions and the forms of social and moral inequality engendered by our advanced technologies Not addressing them in the name of either scientiﬁ c neutrality or of a hastily reconstructed sense of the panhuman bond induced by globalization simply begs the question In my eyes what is striking about the science and technol ogy studies approach whether it relies theoretically on moral philosophy or on sociocultural theory is the high degree of political neutrality it expresses about the posthuman predica ment Both Rose and Franklin et al for instance make it clear that the focus of their research is analytic and aims to achieve a better more thorough and in some ways intimate ethnographic understanding of how these new technologies actually function Science and technology studies tend to dismiss the implications of their positions for a revised vision of the subject Subjectivity is out of the picture and with it a sustained political analysis of the posthuman condition In my view a focus on subjectivity is necessary because this notion enables us to string together issues that are currently scattered across a number of domains For instance issues such as norms and values forms of community bonding and social belonging as well as questions of political governance both assume and require a notion of the subject Critical posthuman thought wants to reassemble a discursive com munity out of the different fragmented contemporary strands of posthumanism I cannot help noticing moreover a rather bizarre and highly problematic division of labour on the question of subjectivity between science and technology studies on the PostHumanism Life beyond the Self one hand and political analyses of advanced capitalism on the other For instance Hardt and Negri 2000 2004 or the Italian school of Lazzarato 2004 and Virno 2004 tend to avoid science and technology and not to treat it with anything like the depth and sophistication that they devote to the analysis of subjectivity I think we may need to review this segregation of discursive ﬁ elds and work towards a re integrated posthuman theory that includes both scientiﬁ c and technological complexity and its implications for political subjectivity political economy and forms of governance I will develop this project gradually in the chapters that follow There is another fundamental problem with the residual humanism of the analytically posthuman attempts to moral ize technology and sideline experiments with new forms of subjectivity namely their overconﬁ dence about the moral intentionality of the technology itself More speciﬁ cally they neglect the current state of autonomy reached by the machines The complexity of our smart technologies lies at the core of the postanthropocentric turn that will be the theme of the next chapter For now let us consider just one aspect of our technological smartness A recent issue of the weekly magazine The Economist 2 June 2012 on Morals and the machine raises some perti nent issues about the degree of autonomy reached by robots and calls for society to develop new rules to manage them The analysis is signiﬁ cant in contrast to the modernist idea of the robot as subservient to the human as exempliﬁ ed by Isaac Asimovs three laws of robotics formulated in 19427 we are now confronted by a new situation which makes 7 These three laws are 1 A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm 2 A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conﬂ ict with the First Law 3 A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conﬂ ict with the First or Second Laws These rules were set up by Isaac Asimov in a short story in 1942 and then reprinted in the world bestseller I Robot in 1950 They became foundational notions in cyberstudies Later Asimov added a fourth law which precedes all others 0 A robot may not harm humanity or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm PostHumanism Life beyond the Self human intervention rather peripheral if not completely irrel evant The Economist argues 2012 11 As robots become more autonomous the notion of computer controlled machines facing ethical decisions is moving out of the realm of science ﬁ ction and into the real world Most of these new robots are military in purpose and I will return to them in chapter 3 but many others are used for perfectly reasonable civilian purposes All of them share a crucial feature they have made it technologically feasible to bypass human decision making at both the operational and the moral levels According to this report humans will increasingly operate not in the loop but on the loop monitoring armed and working robots rather than fully controlling them Only ethical and legal issues remain to be solved to grant responsibility to autonomous machines deci sion making while the cognitive capacities are already in place As they become smarter and more widespread autono mous machines are bound to make lifeordeath decisions and thus assume agency Whether this high degree of autonomy however results in moral decision making is at best an open question Against claims to the inbuilt moral intentionality of the technology I would claim that it is normatively neutral Take some burning issues such as should an unmanned ﬂ ying vehicle also known as a drone ﬁ re on a house where a target is known to be hiding which also shelters civilians Should robots involved in disaster relief tell people the truth about their conditions thus causing panic and pain Such questions lead to the ﬁ eld of machine ethics which aims to give machines the ability to make such choices appropri ately in other words to tell right from wrong And who is to decide According to The Economist 2012 a new ethical approach needs to be developed by active experiments They should focus on three areas especially ﬁ rstly the rule of Laws to determine whether the designer the programmer the man ufacturer or the operator is at fault if a machine goes wrong To allocate responsibility a detailed logs system is needed so that it can explain the reasoning behind the decisionmaking process This has implications for design with a preference PostHumanism Life beyond the Self for systems that obey predeﬁ ned rules rather than decision making systems Secondly when ethical systems are embed ded in robots the judgements they make need to be ones that seem right to most people The techniques of experimental philosophy which studies how people respond to ethical dilemmas should be able to help Thirdly new interdiscipli nary collaboration is required between engineers ethicists lawyers and policymakers all of whom would draw up very different rules if left to their own devices They all stand to gain by working with each other What is posthuman about the situation outlined in The Economist is that it does not assume a human individualized self as the deciding factor of main subject It rather envisages what I would call a transversal interconnection or an assem blage of human and nonhuman actors not unlike Latours Actor Network Theory Law and Hassard 1999 It is sig niﬁ cant that a rather cautious and conservative journal like The Economist faced with the challenge of the posthuman powers of the technologies we have developed does not call for a return to humanist values but for pragmatic experimen tation This prompts three comments on my part ﬁ rstly that I could not agree more that this is no time for nostalgic long ings for the humanist past but for forwardlooking experi ments with new forms of subjectivity Secondly I want to emphasize the normatively neutral structure of contemporary technologies they are not endowed with intrinsic humanistic agency Thirdly I note that the advocates of advanced capital ism seem to be faster in grasping the creative potential of the posthuman than some of the wellmeaning and progressive neohumanist opponents of this system I will return in the next chapter to the opportunist brand of the posthuman developed in the contemporary market economy Critical Posthumanism The third strand of posthuman thought my own variation shows no conceptual or normative ambivalence towards posthumanism I want to move beyond analytic posthuman ism and develop afﬁ rmative perspectives on the posthuman subject My inspiration for taking the jump into critical post PostHumanism Life beyond the Self humanism comes from my antihumanist roots of course More speciﬁ cally the current of thought that has gone further in unfolding the productive potential of the posthuman predicament can be genealogically traced back to the post structuralists the antiuniversalism of feminism and the anti colonial phenomenology of Frantz Fanon 1967 and of his teacher Aimé Césaire 1955 What they have in common in a sustained commitment to work out the implications of posthumanism for our shared understandings of the human subject and of humanity as a whole The work of postcolonial and race theorists displays a situated cosmopolitan posthumanism that is supported as much by the European tradition as by nonWestern PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Humanism and that schooled in its abuses by the experience of Eurocentrism and empire one could fashion a different kind of Humanism that was cosmopolitan and textand language bound in ways that absorbed the great lessons of the past    and still remain attuned to the emergent voices and currents of the present many of them exilic extraterritorial and unhoused 2004 11 Fighting for such subaltern secular spaces is a priority for a posthuman quest for what is known in some quarters as a global ethic for global politics and economics Kung 1998 Paul Gilroys planetary cosmopolitanism 2000 also pro poses a productive form of contemporary critical posthuman ism Gilroy holds Europe and the Europeans accountable for our collective failure in implementing the ideals of the human ist Enlightenment Like the feminists race theorists are suspi cious of deconstructing a subjectposition which historically they never gained the right to Gilroy considers colonialism and fascism as a betrayal of the European ideal of the Enlight enment which he is determined to defend holding Europeans accountable for their ethical and political failings Racism splits common humanity and disengages whites from any ethical sensibility reducing them to an infrahuman moral status It also reduces nonwhites to a subhuman ontological status that exposes them to murderous violence Taking a strong stand against the return of fundamentalist appeals to ethnic differences by a variety of white black Serbian Rwandan Texan and other nationalists Gilroy denounces what Deleuze calls microfascisms Deleuze and Guattari 1987 as the epidemics of our globalized times He locates the site of the ethical transformation in the critique of each nationalistic category not in the assertion of a new dominant one He sets diasporic mobility and the transcultural inter connections up against the forces of nationalism This is a theory of mixture hybridity and cosmopolitanism that is resolutely nonracial Against the enduring power of nation states Gilroy posits instead the afﬁ rmative politics of trans versal movements such as antislavery feminism Médécins sans frontières and the like An altogether different and powerful source of inspiration for contemporary reconﬁ gurations of critical posthumanism PostHumanism Life beyond the Self is ecology and environmentalism They rest on an enlarged sense of interconnection between self and others including the nonhuman or earth others This practice of relating to others requires and is enhanced by the rejection of selfcen tred individualism It produces a new way of combining self interests with the wellbeing of an enlarged community based on environmental interconnections Environmental theory stresses the link between the human istic emphasis on Man as the measure of all things and the domination and exploitation of nature and condemns the abuses of science and technology Both of them involve epis temic and physical violence over the structural others and are related to the European Enlightenment ideal of reason The worldview which equated Mastery with rational scien tiﬁ c control over others also militated against the respect for the diversity of living matters and of human cultures Mies and Shiva 1993 The environmental alternative is a new holistic approach that combines cosmology with anthropol ogy and postsecular mostly feminist spirituality to assert the need for loving respect for diversity in both its human and nonhuman forms Signiﬁ cantly Shiva and Mies stress the importance of lifesustaining spirituality in this struggle for new concrete forms of universality a reverence for the sacred ness of life of deeply seated respect for all that lives This attitude is opposed to Western Humanism and to the Wests investment in rationality and secularity as the precondition for development through science and technology In a holistic perspective they call for the reenchantment of the world 1993 18 or for healing the Earth and that which has been so cruelly disconnected Instead of the emphasis on emancipa tion from the realm of natural necessity Shiva pleads for a form of emancipation that occurs within that realm and in harmony with it From this shift of perspective there follows a critique of the ideal of equality as the emulation of mascu line modes of behaviour and also the rejection of the model of development that is built upon this ideal and is compatible with worldwide forms of market domination Although ecological posthumanists like Shiva take great care to distance themselves from anything that is even remotely related to postmodernism postcolonialism or postfeminism paradoxically they share in the epistemic PostHumanism Life beyond the Self premises of posthuman critiques For instance they agree with the poststructuralist generation on the critique of the homogenization of cultures under the effects of globalized advanced capitalism They propose as an alternative a robust type of environmentalism based on nonWestern neohuman ism What matters for Mies and Shiva is the reassertion of the need for new universal values in the sense of intercon nectedness among humans on a worldwide scale Thus uni versal needs are amalgamated to universal rights and they cover as much basic and concrete necessities such as food shelter health safety as higher cultural needs like education identity dignity knowledge affection joy and care These constitute the material grounding of the situated claims to new ethical values A new ecological posthumanism thus raises issues of power and entitlement in the age of globalization and calls for self reﬂ exivity on the part of the subjects who occupy the former humanist centre but also those who dwell in one of the many scattered centres of power of advanced post modernity Grewal and Kaplan 1994 In my own work I deﬁ ne the critical posthuman subject within an ecophilosophy of multiple belongings as a rela tional subject constituted in and by multiplicity that is to say a subject that works across differences and is also internally differentiated but still grounded and accountable Posthu man subjectivity expresses an embodied and embedded and hence partial form of accountability based on a strong sense of collectivity relationality and hence community building My position is in favour of complexity and promotes radical posthuman subjectivity resting on the ethics of becom ing as we shall see in the next chapter The focus is shifted accordingly from unitary to nomadic subjectivity thus running against the grain of high humanism and its contem porary variations This view rejects individualism but also asserts an equally strong distance from relativism or nihilistic defeatism It promotes an ethical bond of an altogether dif ferent sort from the selfinterests of an individual subject as deﬁ ned along the canonical lines of classical Humanism A posthuman ethics for a nonunitary subject proposes an enlarged sense of interconnection between self and others including the nonhuman or earth others by removing the PostHumanism Life beyond the Self obstacle of selfcentred individualism As we saw earlier con temporary biogenetic capitalism generates a global form of reactive mutual interdependence of all living organisms including nonhumans This sort of unity tends to be of the negative kind as a shared form of vulnerability that is to say a global sense of interconnection between the human and the nonhuman environment in the face of common threats The posthuman recomposition of human interaction that I propose is not the same as the reactive bond of vulnerability but is an afﬁ rmative bond that locates the subject in the ﬂ ow of relations with multiple others As we shall see in the next chapter for me there is a neces sary link between critical posthumanism and the move beyond anthropocentrism I refer to this move as expanding the notion of Life towards the nonhuman or zoe This results in radical posthumanism as a position that transposes hybridity nomadism diasporas and creolization processes into means of regrounding claims to subjectivity connections and com munity among subjects of the human and the nonhuman kind This is the next step of the argument which I will outline in chapter 2 Conclusion This chapter has traced my own itinerary out of the multiple possible genealogies of the posthuman including the rise of alternative forms of critical posthumanism These new forma tions are postulated on the demise of that Man  the former measure of all things Eurocentrism masculinism and anthro pocentrism are exposed accordingly as complex and inter nally differentiated phenomena This alone is in keeping with the highly complex character of the concept of Humanism itself There are in fact many Humanisms and my own itiner ary generationally and geopolitically struggles essentially with one speciﬁ c genealogical line The romantic and positivistic Humanisms through which the European bourgeoisies established their hegemonies over modernity the revolutionary Humanism that shook the world and the liberal Humanism that sought to tame it the PostHumanism Life beyond the Self and opponents the antihumanist Humanism of Heidegger and the humanist antihumanism of Foucault and Althusser the secularist Humanism of Huxley and Dawkins or the post humanism of Gibson and Haraway Davies 1997 141 The fact that these different humanisms cannot be reduced to one linear narrative is part of the problem and the para doxes involved in attempting to overcome Humanism What seems absolutely clear to me is the historical ethical and political necessity to overcome this notion in the light of its history of unfulﬁ lled promises and unacknowledged brutality A key methodological and tactical measure to support this process is to practise the politics of location or situated and accountable knowledge practices Let me conclude with three crucial remarks ﬁ rstly that we do need a new theory of the subject that takes stock of the posthuman turn and hence acknowledges the decline of Humanism Secondly as shown by the proliferation of critical posthuman positions both within and outside the Western philosophical tradition the end of classical Humanism is not a crisis but entails positive consequences Thirdly advanced capitalism has been quick in sensing and exploiting the opportunities opened by the decline of western Humanism and the processes of cultural hybridization induced by glo balization I will address the latter in the next chapter so let me say something brieﬂ y about the other two points Firstly we need to work out the implications of the posthu man predicament in the sense of the decline of European Humanism in order to develop a robust foundation for ethical and political subjectivity The posthuman era is ripe with contradictions as we shall see in the next two chapters These call for ethical evaluation political intervention and norma tive action It follows therefore that the posthuman subject is not postmodern that is to say it is not antifoundationalist Nor is it deconstructivist because it is not linguistically framed The posthuman subjectivity I advocate is rather materialist and vitalist embodied and embedded ﬁ rmly located somewhere according to the feminist politics of loca tion which I have stressed throughout this chapter Why do I stress so much the issue of the subject Because a theory PostHumanism Life beyond the Self of subjectivity as both materialist and relational nature cultural and selforganizing is crucial in order to elaborate critical tools suited to the complexity and contradictions of our times A merely analytical form of posthuman thought does not go far enough More especially a serious concern for the subject allows us to take into account the elements of creativity and imagination desire hopes and aspirations Moore 2011 without which we simply cannot make sense of contemporary global culture and its posthuman overtones We need a vision of the subject that is worthy of the present This brings us to my second concluding remark the issue of Eurocentrism in terms of methodological nationalism Beck 2007 and its longstanding bond to Humanism Con temporary European subjects of knowledge must meet the ethical obligation to be accountable for their past history and the long shadow it casts on their presentday politics9 The new mission that Europe has to embrace entails the criticism of narrowminded selfinterests intolerance and xenophobic rejection of otherness Symbolic of the closure of the European mind is the fate of migrants refugees and asylumseekers who bear the brunt of racism in contempo rary Europe A new agenda needs to be set which is no longer that of European or Eurocentric universal rational subjectivity but rather a radical transformation of it in a break from Europes imperial fascistic and undemocratic tendencies As I stated earlier on in this chapter since the second half of the twen tieth century the crisis of philosophical Humanism  also known as the death of Man  both reﬂ ected and ampliﬁ ed larger concerns about the decline of the geopolitical status of Europe as an imperial worldpower Theory and world historical phenomena work in tandem when it comes to the question of European Humanism Because of this resonance between the two dimensions critical theory has a unique contribution to make to the debate on Europe I believe that the posthuman condition can facilitate the task of redeﬁ ning a new role for Europe in an age where global capitalism is both triumphant and clearly deﬁ cient in 9 As Morin 1987 Passerini 1998 Balibar 2004 and Bauman 2004 have also argued PostHumanism Life beyond the Self terms of sustainability and social justice Holland 2011 This hopeful belief rests on the postnationalist approach Habermas 2001 Braidotti 2006 which expresses the decline of Eurocentrism as a historical event and calls for a qualitative shift of perspective in our collective sense of iden tity Seyla Benhabib in her brilliant work on alternative cos mopolitanism 2007 addresses the question of Europe as a site of transformation Her emphasis on a pluralist cosmo politan practice and her commitment to the rights of refugees and stateless people as well as migrants innovates on clas sical universalist notions of cosmopolitanism and calls for situated and contextspeciﬁ c practices This resonates posi tively with my situated posthuman ethics A primary task for posthuman critical theory therefore is to draw accurate and precise cartographies for these different subject positions as springboards towards posthuman recompositions of a pan human cosmopolitan bond More speciﬁ cally I would like to push the case further than Habermas social democratic aspiration and argue for a post human project of becomingminoritarian or becoming nomad of Europe Deleuze and Guattari 1987 Braidotti 2008 This is a way of bypassing a number of binary pitfalls for instance between a globalized and culturally diverse Europe on the one hand and the narrow and xenophobic deﬁ nitions of European identity on the other The becoming nomad of Europe entails resistance against nationalism xen ophobia and racism bad habits of the old imperial Europe As such it is the opposite of the grandiose and aggressive universalism of the past which is replaced by a situated and accountable perspective It embraces a new political and ethical project by taking a ﬁ rm stand also against the For tress Europe syndrome and reviving tolerance as a tool of social justice Brown 2006 The posthuman turn can support and enhance this project in so far as it displaces the exclusive focus on the idea of Europe as the cradle of Humanism driven by a form of uni versalism that endows it with a unique sense of historical purpose The process of becomingminoritarian or becoming nomad of Europe involves the rejection of the selfappointed missionary role of Europe as the alleged centre of the world If it is the case that a sociocultural mutation is taking place PostHumanism Life beyond the Self in the direction of a multiethnic multimedia society then the transformation cannot affect only the pole of the others It must equally dislocate the position and the prerogative of the same the former centre The project of developing a new kind of postnationalist nomadic European identity is certainly challenging in that it requires disidentiﬁ cation from established nationbound identities This project is political at heart but it has a strong affective core made of convic tions vision and active desire for change We can collectively empower these alternative becomings My posthuman sensibility may come across as visionary and even impatient but it is very proactive or to use my favourite term afﬁ rmative Afﬁ rmative politics combines cri tique with creativity in the pursuit of alternative visions and projects As far as I am concerned the challenge of the post human condition consists in grabbing the opportunities offered by the decline of the unitary subject position upheld by Humanism which has mutated in a number of complex directions For instance the cultural intermixity already available within our postindustrial ethnoscapes and the re compositions of genders and sexualities sizzling under the apparently sedate image of equal opportunities far from being indicators of a crisis are productive events They are the new starting points that bring into play untapped possi bilities for bonding community building and empowerment Similarly the current scientiﬁ c revolution led by contempo rary biogenetic environmental neural and other sciences creates powerful alternatives to established practices and deﬁ nitions of subjectivity Instead of falling back on the sedimented habits of thought that the humanist past has institutionalized the posthuman predicament encourages us to undertake a leap forward into the complexities and para doxes of our times To meet this task new conceptual creativ ity is needed Chapter 2 PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species I loved George Eliots prose well before I even knew that she actually translated Spinoza my favourite philosopher into English Mary Evans was a woman of many talents and anyone who ever identiﬁ ed with Dorothea in Middlemarch 1973 or Maggie in The Mill on the Floss 2003 may not be cognitively aware of the fact that she stepped  surrepti tiously and fatally  into a monistic universe of intersecting affective relations that simply make the world go round George Eliot has authored my favourite sentence in the English language If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrels heart beat and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence As it is the quickest of us walk around well wadded with stupidity Eliot 1973 226 The roar which lies on the other side of the urbane civilized veneer that allows for bound identities and efﬁ cient social interaction is the Spinozist indicator of the raw cosmic energy that underscores the making of civilizations societies and their subjects Vitalist materialism is a concept that helps us make sense of that external dimension which in fact enfolds within the subject as the internalized score of cosmic vibra PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species tions Deleuze 1992 Deleuze and Guattari 1994 It also constitutes the core of a posthuman sensibility that aims at overcoming anthropocentrism Let me spell out some of these rather dense ideas A monis tic universe refers to Spinozas central concept that matter the world and humans are not dualistic entities structured according to principles of internal or external opposition The obvious target of criticism here is Descartes famous mind body distinction but for Spinoza the concept goes even further matter is one driven by the desire for selfexpression and ontologically free The absence of any reference to nega tivity and to violent dialectical oppositions caused intense criticism of Spinoza on the part of Hegel and the Marxist Hegelians Spinozas monistic worldview was seen as politi cally ineffective and holistic at heart This situation changed dramatically in the 1970s in France when a new wave of scholars rehabilitated Spinozist monism precisely as an antidote to some of the contradictions of Marxism and as a way of clarifying Hegels relationship to Marx1 The main idea is to overcome dialectical oppositions engendering non dialectical understandings of materialism itself Braidotti 1991 Cheah 2008 as an alternative to the Hegelian scheme The Spinozist legacy therefore consists in a very active concept of monism which allowed these modern French phi losophers to deﬁ ne matter as vital and selforganizing thereby producing the staggering combination of vitalist material ism Because this approach rejects all forms of transcenden talism it is also known as radical immanence Monism results in relocating difference outside the dialectical scheme as a complex process of differing which is framed by both internal and external forces and is based on the centrality of the relation to multiple others These monistic premises are for me the building blocks for a posthuman theory of subjectivity that does not rely on clas sical Humanism and carefully avoids anthropocentrism The 1 The group around Althusser started the debate in the mid1960s Deleuzes pathbreaking study of Spinoza dates from 1968 in English in 1990 Machereys HegelSpinoza analysis came out in 1979 in English in 2011 Negris work on the imagination in Spinoza in 1981 in English in 1991 PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species classical emphasis on the unity of all matter which is central to Spinoza is reinforced by an updated scientiﬁ c understand ing of the selforganizing or smart structure of living matter These ideas are supported by new advances in contemporary biosciences neural and cognitive sciences and by the infor matics sector Posthuman subjects are technologically medi ated to an unprecedented degree For instance a neoSpinozist approach is supported and expanded today by new develop ments in the mindbody interrelation within the neural sci ences Damasio 2003 In my view there is a direct connection between monism the unity of all living matter and post anthropocentrism as a general frame of reference for contem porary subjectivity Global Warning George Eliots work is a good lead into at least some aspects of this materialist or as I will argue later in the chapter matterrealist worldview The support is welcome as many of the assumptions and premises of the postanthropocentric universe are somewhat counter intuitive although the term has acquired widespread currency nowadays In mainstream public debates for instance the posthuman is usually coated in anxiety about the excesses of technological intervention and the threat of climate change or by elation about the potential for human enhancement In academic culture on the other hand the critique of anthropocentrism has even more shattering implications than the transformative agenda of posthumanism which I analysed in the previous chapter The postanthropocentric turn linked to the compounded impacts of globalization and of technologydriven forms of mediation strikes the human at hisher heart and shifts the parameters that used to deﬁ ne anthropos In this chapter I want to argue that the issue of the posthu man in relation to postanthropocentrism is of an altogether different order than in posthumanism For one thing whereas the latter mobilized primarily the disciplinary ﬁ eld of philoso phy history cultural studies and the classical Humanities in general the issue of postanthropocentrism enlists also science and technology studies new media and digital culture envi PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species ronmentalism and earthsciences biogenetics neuroscience and robotics evolutionary theory critical legal theory prima tology animal rights and science ﬁ ction This high degree of transdisciplinarity alone adds an extra layer of complexity to the issue The key question for me is what understandings of contemporary subjectivity and subjectformation are enabled by a postanthropocentric approach What comes after the anthropocentric subject How one reacts to this change of perspective depends to a large extent on ones relationship to technology Being rather technophilic myself I am quite upbeat I will always side ﬁ rmly with the liberatory and even transgressive poten tial of these technologies against those who attempt to index them to either a predictable conservative proﬁ le or to a proﬁ toriented system that fosters and inﬂ ates individualism I do think that one of the most pointed paradoxes of our era is precisely the tension between the urgency of ﬁ nding new and alternative modes of political and ethical agency for our technologically mediated world and the inertia of established mental habits on the other Donna Haraway put it with cus tomary wit the machines are so alive whereas the humans are so inert Haraway 1985 As if to mirror this science and technology studies nowadays is a thriving area in aca demic institutions whereas the Humanities are in serious trouble It may be useful to start by clarifying some aspects of the globalized context in which the decentring of anthropocen trism is taking place As I argued elsewhere Braidotti 2002 2006 advanced capitalism is a spinning machine that actively produces differences for the sake of commodiﬁ cation It is a multiplier of deterritorialized differences which are packaged and marketed under the labels of new dynamic and nego tiable identities and an endless choice of consumer goods This logic triggers a proliferation and a vampiric consump tion of quantitative options Many of them have to do with cultural others from fusion cooking to world music Jackie Stacey in her analysis of the new organic food industry Franklin et al 2000 argues that we literally eat the global economy Paul Gilroy 2000 and Celia Lury 1998 remind us that we also wear it listen to it and watch it on our many screens on a daily basis PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species The global circulation of goods data capital bits and bytes of information frames the interaction of contemporary subjects on a daily basis Multiple choices confront consum ers at every step but with varying degrees of actual freedom of choice Take for instance the transformations incurred by the formerly elementary task of making a call to the local bank What we have grown to expect nowadays is either an automated posthuman system of replies offering subsets of numbers that connect us to a further web of prerecorded messages Or else we welcome the relief of hearing a reallife human voice knowing all along that it is emanating from some call centre miles away in one of the emerging econo mies of the world The end result is that phone calls are cheaper than ever but the actual length of the calls is deﬁ nitely getting longer as the caller wades through multiple new hurdles Of course Internet communication is replacing all this but my point is that the spinning differential force of our economic system is such that we have to run twice as fast across automated replies or transcontinental phone lines just to stay in the same place The most salient trait of the contemporary global economy is therefore its technoscientiﬁ c structure It is built on the convergence between different and previously differentiated branches of technology notably the four horsemen of the posthuman apocalypse nanotechnology biotechnology information technology and cognitive science The biogenetic structure of contemporary capitalism is especially important and central to the discussion on the posthuman This aspect involves the Human Genome project stem cell research and biotechnological intervention upon animals seeds cells and plants In substance advanced capitalism both invests and proﬁ ts from the scientiﬁ c and economic control and the commodiﬁ cation of all that lives This context produces a paradoxical and rather opportunistic form of postanthropo centrism on the part of market forces which happily trade on Life itself The commodiﬁ cation of Life by biogenetic advanced capi talism however is a complex affair Consider my argument the great scientiﬁ c advances of molecular biology have taught us that matter is selforganized autopoietic whereas monis tic philosophy adds that it is also structurally relational and PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species hence connected to a variety of environments These insights combine in deﬁ ning intelligent vitality or selforganizing capacity as a force that is not conﬁ ned within feedback loops internal to the individual human self but is present in all living matter Why is matter so intelligent though Because it is driven by informational codes which both deploy their own bars of information and interact in multiple ways with the social psychic and ecological environments Guattari 2000 What happens to subjectivity in this complex ﬁ eld of forces and data ﬂ ows My argument is that it becomes an expanded relational self engendered by the cumulative effect of all these factors Braidotti 1991 2011a The relational capacity of the posthuman subject is not conﬁ ned within our species but it includes all nonanthropomorphic elements Living matter  including the ﬂ esh  is intelligent and self organizing but it is so precisely because it is not disconnected from the rest of organic life I therefore do not work com pletely within the social constructivist method but rather emphasize the nonhuman vital force of Life which is what I have coded as zoe Postanthropocentrism is marked by the emergence of the politics of life itself Rose 2007 Life far from being codi ﬁ ed as the exclusive property or the unalienable right of one species the human over all others or of being sacralized as a preestablished given is posited as process interactive and openended This vitalist approach to living matter displaces the boundary between the portion of life  both organic and discursive  that has traditionally been reserved for anthro pos that is to say bios and the wider scope of animal and nonhuman life also known as zoe Zoe as the dynamic self organizing structure of life itself Braidotti 2006 2011b stands for generative vitality It is the transversal force that cuts across and reconnects previously segregated species cat egories and domains Zoecentred egalitarianism is for me the core of the postanthropocentric turn it is a materialist secular grounded and unsentimental response to the oppor tunistic transspecies commodiﬁ cation of Life that is the logic of advanced capitalism It is also an afﬁ rmative reaction of social and cultural theory to the great advances made by the other culture that of the sciences The relationship between the two will be addressed in chapter 4 PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species A posthuman theory of the subject emerges therefore as an empirical project that aims at experimenting with what contemporary biotechnologically mediated bodies are capable of doing These nonproﬁ t experiments with contem porary subjectivity actualize the virtual possibilities of an expanded relational self that functions in a natureculture continuum and is technologically mediated Not surprisingly this nonproﬁ t experimental approach to different practices of subjectivity is not exactly the spirit of contemporary capitalism Under the cover of individualism fuelled by a quantitative range of consumer choices that system effectively promotes uniformity and conformism to the dominant ideology The perversity of advanced capital ism and its undeniable success consists in reattaching the potential for experimentation with new subject formations back to an overinﬂ ated notion of possessive individualism MacPherson 1962 tied to the proﬁ t principle This is pre cisely the opposite direction from the nonproﬁ t experimenta tions with intensity which I defend in my theory of posthuman subjectivity The opportunistic political economy of bio genetic capitalism turns Lifezoe  that is to say human and nonhuman intelligent matter  into a commodity for trade and proﬁ t What the neoliberal market forces are after and what they ﬁ nancially invest in is the informational power of living matter itself The capitalization of living matter produces a new political economy which Melinda Cooper 2008 calls Life as surplus It introduces discursive and material politi cal techniques of population control of a very different order from the administration of demographics which preoccu pied Foucaults work on biopolitical governmentality The warnings are now global Today we are undertaking risk analyses not only of entire social and national systems but also of whole sections of the population in the world risk society Beck 1999 Data banks of biogenetic neural and mediatic information about individuals are the true capital today as the success of Facebook demonstrates at a more banal level Datamining includes proﬁ ling practices that identify different types or characteristics and highlights them as special strategic targets for capital investments This kind of predictive analytics of the human amounts to Life PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species mining2 with visibility predictability and exportability as the key criteria Cooper sums up lucidly the complications of this political economy 2008 3 Where does reproduction end and technical invention begin when life is out to work at the microbiological or cellular level What is at stake in the extension of property law to cover everything from the molecular elements of life biologi cal patents to the biospheric accident catastrophe bonds What is the relationship between new theories of biological growth complexity and evolution and recent neoliberal theo ries of accumulation And how is it possible to counter these new dogmatisms without falling into the trap of neofunda mentalist politics of life the righttolife movement or ecologi cal survivalism for example It is signiﬁ cant to note the emphasis Cooper places on the risk of neofundamentalist positions like the biological deter minism of natural law advocates or ecological holism This essentialist risk is high in our current sociopolitical context and it requires constant critical scrutiny on the part of schol ars who start instead from the posthuman idea of the nature culture continuum Patricia Clough pursues a similar line in her analysis of the affective turn 2008 Because advanced capitalism reduces bodies to their informational substrate in terms of energy resources it levels out other categorical differences so that equivalencies might be found to value one form of life against another one vital capacity against another Clough 2008 17 What constitutes capital value in our social system is the accumulation of information itself its immanent vital quali ties and selforganizing capacity Clough provides an impres sive list of the concrete techniques employed by cognitive capitalism Moulier Boutang 2012 to test and monitor the capacities of affective or biomediated bodies DNA testing brain ﬁ ngerprinting neural imaging body heat detection and iris or hand recognition All these are also immediately opera tionalized as surveillance techniques both in civil society and in the war against terror This necropolitical governmentality is the topic of the next chapter 2 With thanks to Jose van Dijck for this formulation PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species For now let me stress my main point the opportunistic political economy of biogenetic capitalism induces if not the actual erasure at least the blurring of the distinction between the human and other species when it comes to proﬁ ting from them Seeds plants animals and bacteria ﬁ t into this logic of insatiable consumption alongside various specimens of humanity The image of Da Vincis Vitruvian Man on a Star bucks coffee cup see ﬁ gure 21 captures ironically the mer etricious character of the posthuman connections engendered by global capital I shop therefore I am may well be its motto The global economy is postanthropocentric in that it ulti mately uniﬁ es all species under the imperative of the market and its excesses threaten the sustainability of our planet as a whole A negative sort of cosmopolitan interconnection is therefore established through a panhuman bond of vulner ability The size of recent scholarship on the environmental Figure 21 Vitruvian Man on Starbucks Coffee Cup  Guardian News  Media Ltd 2011 PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species crisis and climate change alone testiﬁ es to this state of emer gency and to the emergence of the earth as a political agent Postanthropocentrism is especially thriving in popular culture and has been criticized Smelik and Lykke 2008 as a negative tendency to represent the transformations of the relations between humans and technological apparatus or machines in the mode of neogothic horror The literature and cinema of extinction of our and other species including disas ter movies is a successful genre of its own enjoying broad popular appeal I have labelled this narrow and negative social imaginary as technoteratological Braidotti 2002 that is to say as the object of cultural admiration and aber ration This dystopian reﬂ ection of the biogenetic structure of contemporary capitalism is crucial to explain the popular ity of this genre The social theory literature on shared anxiety about the future of both our species and of our humanist legacy is also rich and varied Important liberal thinkers like Habermas 2003 and inﬂ uential ones like Fukuyama 2002 are very alert on this issue as are social critics like Sloterdijk 2009 and Borradori 2003 In different ways they express deep concern for the status of the human and seem particularly struck by moral and cognitive panic at the prospect of the posthuman turn blaming our advanced technologies for it I share their concern but as a posthuman thinker with distinct antihumanist feelings I am less prone to panic at the pros pect of a displacement of the centrality of the human and can also see the advantages of such an evolution For instance once these postanthropocentric practices blur the qualitative lines of demarcation not only among categories malefemale blackwhite humananimal dead alive centremargin etc but also within each one of them the human becomes subsumed into global networks of control and commodiﬁ cation which have taken Life as the main target The generic ﬁ gure of the human is consequently in trouble Donna Haraway puts is as follows our authenticity is warranted by a database for the human genome The molecular database is held in an informational database as legally branded intellectual property in a national laboratory with the mandate to make the text publicly avail PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species able for the progress of science and the advancement of indus try This is Man the taxonomic type become Man the brand 1997 74 We know by now that the standard which was posited in the universal mode of Man has been widely criticized Lloyd 1984 precisely because of its partiality Universal Man in fact is implicitly assumed to be masculine white urbanized speaking a standard language heterosexually inscribed in a reproductive unit and a full citizen of a recognized polity Irigaray 1985b Deleuze and Guattari 1987 How non representative can you get As if this line of criticism were not enough this Man is also called to task and brought back to its species speciﬁ city as anthropos Rabinow 2003 Esposito 2008 that is to say as the representative of a hier archical hegemonic and generally violent species whose cen trality is now challenged by a combination of scientiﬁ c advances and global economic concerns Massumi refers to this phenomenon as ExMan a genetic matrix embedded in the materiality of the human 1998 60 and as such undergoing signiﬁ cant mutations species integrity is lost in a biochemical mode expressing the mutability of human matter 1998 60 These analyses indicate in my view that the political economy of biogenetic capitalism is postanthropocentric in its very structures but not necessarily or automatically post humanistic It also tends to be deeply inhumane as we shall see in the next chapter The posthuman dimension of post anthropocentrism can consequently be seen as a deconstruc tive move What it deconstructs is species supremacy but it also inﬂ icts a blow to any lingering notion of human nature anthropos and bios as categorically distinct from the life of animals and nonhumans or zoe What comes to the fore instead is a natureculture continuum in the very embodied structure of the extended self as I argued earlier This shift can be seen as a sort of anthropological exodus from the dominant conﬁ gurations of the human as the king of creation Hardt and Negri 2000 215  a colossal hybridization of the species Once the centrality of anthropos is challenged a number of boundaries between Man and his others go tumbling PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species down in a cascade effect that opens up unexpected perspec tives Thus if the crisis of Humanism inaugurates the posthu man by empowering the sexualized and racialized human others to emancipate themselves from the dialectics of masterslave relations the crisis of anthropos relinquishes the demonic forces of the naturalized others Animals insects plants and the environment in fact the planet and the cosmos as a whole are called into play This places a different burden of responsibility on our species which is the primary cause for the mess The fact that our geological era is known as the anthropocene3 stresses both the technologically mediated power acquired by anthropos and its potentially lethal con sequences for everyone else Furthermore the transposition of naturalized others poses a number of conceptual and methodological complications linked to the critique of anthropocentrism This is due to the pragmatic fact that as embodied and embedded entities we are all part of nature even though academic philosophy con tinues to claim transcendental grounds for human conscious ness How to reconcile this materialist awareness with the task of critical thought As a brand of vital materialism posthuman theory contests the arrogance of anthropocen trism and the exceptionalism of the Human as a transcen dental category It strikes instead an alliance with the productive and immanent force of zoe or life in its non human aspects This requires a mutation of our shared under standing of what it means to think at all let alone think critically In the rest of this chapter I will develop this insight into a number of interrelated ﬁ elds of postanthropocentric enquiry My focus is on the productive aspects of the posthuman predicament and the extent to which it opens up perspectives for afﬁ rmative transformations of both the structures of sub jectivity and the production of theory and knowledge I have labelled these processes as becominganimal becomingearth and becomingmachine with reference to Deleuze and Guat taris philosophy though I am very independent in relation to them Thus the becominganimal axis of transformation in 2002 and has become widely accepted PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species entails the displacement of anthropocentrism and the recogni tion of trans species solidarity on the basis of our being environmentally based that is to say embodied embedded and in symbiosis with other species Margulis and Sagan 1995 The planetary or becomingearth dimension brings issues of environmental and social sustainability to the fore with special emphasis on ecology and the climate change issue The becomingmachine axis cracks open the division between humans and technological circuits introducing bio technologically mediated relations as foundational for the constitution the subject I will conclude by advancing an idea that will be central to chapter 4 namely that we need to apply the vitalist brand of matterrealism as the foundation for a system of ethical values where life stands central not only to the Life Sciences but also to the Humanities in the twenty ﬁ rst century Let us start by looking at each of these cases in turn The Posthuman as Becominganimal Postanthropocentrism displaces the notion of species hierar chy and of a single common standard for Man as the measure of all things In the ontological gap thus opened other species come galloping in This is easier done than said in the language and methodological conventions of critical theory Is language not the anthropological tool par excel lence We saw in the previous chapter that the humanist image of thought also sets the frame for a selfcongratulating relationship of Man to himself which conﬁ rms the dominant subject as much in what he includes as his core characteristics as in what he excludes as other The subject of Humanism makes an internally contradic tory claim in order to support his sovereign position He is simultaneously an abstract universal and very much the spokesman of an elite species both Human and anthropos This logically impossible claim rests on an assumed political anatomy according to which the counterpart of the power of reason is the notion of Man as rational animal As we saw in chapter 1 the latter is expected to inhabit a perfectly functional physical body implicitly modelled upon ideals of PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species white masculinity normality youth and health The dialectics of otherness is the inner engine of humanist Mans power who assigns difference on a hierarchical scale as a tool of governance All other modes of embodiment are cast out of the subject position and they include anthropomorphic others nonwhite nonmasculine nonnormal nonyoung non healthy disabled malformed or enhanced peoples They also cover more ontological categorical divides between Man and zoomorphic organic or earth others All these others are rendered as pejoration pathologized and cast out of normal ity on the side of anomaly deviance monstrosity and bestial ity This process is inherently anthropocentric gendered and racialized in that it upholds aesthetic and moral ideals based on white masculine heterosexual European civilization Let us look more closely at the mechanisms involved in the dialectics of negative difference from the angle of animals The animal is the necessary familiar and much cherished other of anthropos This familiarity however is fraught with perils In a brilliant mock taxonomy Louis Borges classiﬁ ed animals into three groups those we watch television with those we eat and those we are scared of These exceptionally high levels of lived familiarity conﬁ ne the humananimal interaction within classical parameters namely an oedipal ized relationship you and me together on the same sofa an instrumental thou shalt be consumed eventually and a fantasmatic one exotic extinct infotainment objects of titillation Let us now analyse brieﬂ y each of these The oedipal rela tionship between humans and animals is unequal and framed by the dominant human and structurally masculine habit of taking for granted free access to and the consumption of the bodies of others animals included As a mode of relation it is therefore neurotic in that it is saturated with projections taboos and fantasies It is also a token of the human subjects sense of supreme ontological entitlement Derrida referred to the power of the human species over animals in terms of carnophallogocentrism Derrida 2006 and criticized it as an example of epistemic and material violence In their com mentary Berger and Segarra 2011 argue that Derridas work on animality is not peripheral but quite central to his analysis of the limits of the Enlightenment project Derridas PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species necessary correlate of the critique of Humanism The strong logical and historical connection between them frames a political critique of the damage inﬂ icted by Western reason upon its multiple others The recognition of shared ties of vulnerability can generate new forms of posthuman commu nity and compassion Pick 2011 This familiar oedipalized and hence ambivalent and manipulative relationship between humans and animals expressed itself in a variety of ways that have become entrenched in our mental and cultural habits The ﬁ rst is metaphorization Animals have long spelled out the social grammar of virtues and moral distinctions for the beneﬁ t of humans This normative function was canonized in moral glossaries and cognitive bestiaries that turned animals into metaphorical referents for norms and values Just think of the illustrious literary pedigree of the noble eagles the deceitful foxes the humble lambs and the crickets and bees that Livy and Moliere have immortalized These metaphorical habits feed into the fantasmatic dimension of humananimal interaction which in contemporary culture is best expressed by the entertain ment value of nonanthropomorphic characters ranging from King Kong to the hybrid blue creatures of Avatar without forgetting Spielbergs Jurassic Park stardinosaurs At the social level the evidence for new humananimal interaction is strong and often it comes down to questions of representation Companion species as Haraway put it 2003 have been historically conﬁ ned within infantilizing narratives that established affective kinship relations across the species The most dominant spinoff of this narrative is the sentimental discourse about dogs devotion and uncondi tional loyalty which Haraway argues against with all her mighty passion As a nature cultural compound a dog  not unlike other products of techno science  is a radical other albeit a signiﬁ cant other It is as socially constructed as most humans not only through genetic screening but also via health and hygiene regulations and various grooming prac tices Who has not struggled to suppress a giggle of recogni tion at the news of the success of pets diet clinics in the glamorous suburbs of LA Some surprising forms of material equivalence are found among different lifeforms in these PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species posthuman days We need to devise therefore a system of representation that matches the complexity of contemporary nonhuman animals and their proximity to humans The point now is to move towards a new mode of relation animals are no longer the signifying system that props up the humans selfprojections and moral aspirations They need to be approached in a neoliteral mode as a code system or a zoontology of their own Wolfe 2003 The second major manifestation of the problematic and contradictory familiarity between humans and animals is linked to the market economy and labour force Since antiq uity animals have constituted a sort of zooproletariat in a species hierarchy run by the humans They have been exploited for hard labour as natural slaves and logistical supports for humans prior to and throughout the mechanical age They constitute moreover an industrial resource in themselves animal bodies being primary material products starting from milk and their edible meat but think also of the tusks of elephants the hides of most creatures the wool of sheep the oil and fat of whales the silk of caterpillars etc As indicated by the ﬁ gures I presented in the second vignette of the general introduction this political economy of fullscale discursive and material exploitation continues today with animals providing living material for scientiﬁ c experiment for our biotechnological agriculture the cosmet ics industry drugs and pharmaceutical industries and other sectors of the economy Animals like pigs and mice are geneti cally modiﬁ ed to produce organs for humans in xenotrans plantation experiments Using animals as test cases and cloning them is now an established scientiﬁ c practice Onco mouse and Dolly the sheep are already part of history Haraway 1997 Franklin 2007 In advanced capitalism animals of all categories and species have been turned into tradable disposable bodies inscribed in a global market of postanthropocentric exploitation As I said earlier trafﬁ c in animals constitutes the third largest illegal trade in the world today after drugs and arms but ahead of women This creates a new negative bond between humans and animals At the height of the Cold War when dogs and monkeys were being launched into orbit as part of the budding space exploration programmes and escalating competition between PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species the USA and the USSR George Orwell ironically stated that all animals are equal but some are more equal than others Orwell 1946 At the dawn of the third millennium in a world caught in indeﬁ nite and technologically mediated warfare such metaphorical grandeur rings rather hollow Postanthropocentrism rather suggests the opposite no animal is more equal than any other because they are all equally inscribed in a market economy of planetary exchanges that commodiﬁ es them to a comparable degree and therefore makes them equally disposable All other distinctions are blurred At the same time the old mode of relation is currently being restructured A zoeegalitarian turn is taking place that encourages us to engage in a more equitable relationship with animals Contemporary postanthropocentric thought pro duces an antiOedipal animality within a fastchanging technoculture that engenders mutations at all levels In my view the challenge today is how to deterritorialize or noma dize the humananimal interaction so as to bypass the metaphysics of substance and its corollary the dialectics of otherness This also entails secularizing accordingly the concept of human nature and the life which animates it Donna Haraway a pioneer in postanthropocentric thought and shrewd analyst of humananimal interaction captured this fundamental shift in the ironical cartoons that depict companion species in the Vitruvian pose see ﬁ gures 22 and 23 Can a cat or a dog be the measure of at least some if not exactly all things Can it displace the genomic hierarchy that tacitly supported the humanists selfrepresentation Here we see the contradictory effects of the postanthropo centric politics of life itself which I commented on earlier in the chapter The posthuman in the sense of postanthropocentrism dis places the dialectical scheme of opposition replacing well established dualisms with the recognition of deep zoeegalitarianism between humans and animals The vitality of their bond is based on sharing this planet territory or environment on terms that are no longer so clearly hierarchi cal nor selfevident This vital interconnection posits a quali tative shift of the relationship away from speciesism and towards an ethical appreciation of what bodies human PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species Figure 22 S Harris Leonardo Da Vincis Dog Source wwwcartoonstockcom animal others can do An ethology of forces based on Spi nozist ethics emerges as the main point of reference for chang ing humananimal interaction It traces a new political frame which I see as an afﬁ rmative project in response to the com modiﬁ cation of Life in all its forms that is the opportunistic logic of advanced capitalism This postanthropocentric approach requires more efforts of our imagination to ground our representations in reallife PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species conditions and in an afﬁ rmative manner In this respect we need to rethink dogs cats and other sofabased companions today as cutting across species partitions not only affectively but also organically so to speak As naturecultural com pounds these animals qualify as cyborgs that is to say as creatures of mixity or vectors of posthuman relationality In Figure 23 Maggie Stiefvater Vitruvian Cat Source Maggie Stiefvater via Flickr PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species many ways Dolly the sheep is the ideal ﬁ guration for the complex biomediated temporalities and forms of intimacy that represent the new postanthropocentric humananimal interaction Sheit is simultaneously the last specimen of her species  descended from the lineage of sheep that were con ceived and reproduced as such  and the ﬁ rst specimen of a new species the electronic sheep that Philip K Dick dreamed of the forerunner of the androids society of Blade Runner 1982 Cloned not conceived sexually heterogeneous mix of organism and machine Dolly has become delinked from reproduction and hence divorced from descent Dolly is no daughter of any member of herits old species  simultane ously orphan and mother of heritself First of a new gender sheit is also beyond the gender dichotomies of the patriarchal kinship system A copy made in the absence of one single original Dolly pushes the logic of the postmodern simulacrum to its ultimate perversion Sheit spins Immaculate Conception into a bio genetic thirdcentury version The irony reaches a pathetic peak when we remember that Dolly died of a banal and all too familiar disease rheumatism After which to add insult to injury she suffered a last indignity taxidermy and was embalmed and exhibited in a science museum as a scientiﬁ c rarity Sheit simultaneously inhabits the nineteenth century and as a media celebrity also strikes a chord with the twentieth century Both archaic and hypermodern Dolly is a compound of multiple anachronisms situated across different chronological axes Sheit inhabits complex and selfcontradictory time zones Like other contemporary technoteratological animals or entities oncomouse comes to mind Dolly shatters the linearity of time and exists in a continuous present This technoelectronic timeless time is saturated with asynchronicity that is to say it is structurally unhinged Thinking about Dolly blurs the categories of thought we have inherited from the past  sheit stretches the longitude and latitude of thought itself adding depth intensity and con tradiction Because sheit embodies complexity this entity which is no longer an animal but not yet fully a machine is the icon of the posthuman condition Haraway also stresses the need for new images visions and representations of the humananimal continuum She pro PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species poses to start rethinking humananimal interaction from the hybrid ﬁ guration of oncomouse As the ﬁ rst patented animal in the world a transgenic organism created for the purposes of research the oncomouse is posthuman in every possible sense of the term It has been created for the purpose of proﬁ tmaking trafﬁ cking between the laboratories and the marketplace and thus navigates between patenting ofﬁ ces and the research benches Haraway wants to establish a sense of kinship with this transgenic animal Calling her my sibling    male or female she is my sister 1997 79 Haraway stresses the extent to which oncomouse is both a victim and a scapegoat a Christlike ﬁ gure that sacriﬁ ces herself in order to ﬁ nd the cure for breast cancer and thus save the lives of many women a mammal rescuing other mammals Because the oncomouse breaks the purity of lineage she is also a spectral ﬁ gure Not unlike Dolly it is the never dead that pollutes the natural order simply by being manufactured and not born She is a cyberteratological apparatus that scram bles the established codes and thus destabilizes but also reconstructs the posthuman subject Figurations like Dolly and oncomouse are no metaphors but rather vehicles to imaginatively ground our powers of understanding within the shifting landscapes of the present4 I am quite aware that my cheerful endorsement of the postanthropocentric turn may appear as overenthusiastic and even triumphalist to some Moore 2011 As I said in the previous chapter ones relation to the posthuman is affected in the ﬁ rst place by ones critical assessment of the human My deepseated antihumanist leanings show in the glee with which I welcome the displacement of anthropos My posthuman enthusiasm however does not blind me to the cruel contradictions and the power differences at work in contemporary humananimal interaction The old patterns of instrumental behaviour are still operative of course with animals being used for food wool and skin products labour in agriculture industry and science If anything the necro political economy is exacerbated by the global conﬂ icts and 4 In this regard these ﬁ gurations fulﬁ l the same function as Deleuzes conceptual personae Deleuze and Guattari 1994 Braidotti 2011a 2011b PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species by the ﬁ nancial crisis In so far as advanced capitalism markets and proﬁ ts from the biogenetic structures of life itself it contributes to the displacement of anthropocentrism Animals are caught in a double bind on the one hand they are more than ever the object of inhumane exploitation on the other hand they beneﬁ t from residual forms of reparative human ization This conﬂ icting situation leads me to conclude that postanthropocentrism is for both humans and animals a mixed blessing Allow me to explain Compensatory Humanism Throughout the second half of the twentieth century the issue of animal rights has gathered momentum in most advanced liberal democracies Political parties devoted entirely to the wellbeing of nonanthropocentric others  Green or Animal parties  sit in many Northern European parliaments They rest on the critique of speciesism that is to say the anthro pocentric arrogance of Man as the dominant species whose sense of entitlement includes access to the body of all others Animal rights activists defend the end of anthropolatry the assumption of human superiority and call for more respect and priority to be given to the interests of other species and life forms In animal rights theory these postanthropocentric ana lytic premises are combined with neohumanism to reassess the validity of a number of humanist values These concern anthropomorphic selves who are assumed to hold unitary identity selfreﬂ exive consciousness moral rationality and the capacity to share emotions like empathy and solidarity The same virtues and capabilities are also attributed to non anthropomorphic others The epistemological and moral assumptions that underscore this position have been in place since the Enlightenment but were previously reserved for humans only to the detriment of all nonhuman agents such as animals and plants Animal rights people whom I deﬁ ne as postanthropocentric neohumanists converge on the need to uphold and expand on these values across all species The best known champion of animal rights Peter Singer defends a utilitarian position in favour of the moral rational PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species ism of animals A liberal humanist like Nussbaum 2006 agrees to pursue species equity Working within the classical liberal tradition Mary Midgley 1996 does not even trust the term anthropocentrism referring to it as human chau vinism narrowness of sympathy comparable to national or race or genderchauvinism It could also be called exclusive humanism as opposed to the hospitable friendly inclusive kind 1996 105 The alternative Midgley supports is to admit that we are not selfcontained and selfsufﬁ cient either as a species or as individuals but live naturally in deep mutual dependence 1996 910 In her powerful analyses of the environmental crisis of reason Val Plumwood 2003 also calls for a new dialogical interspecies ethics based on decentring human privilege For radical ecofeminists both utilitarianism and liberal ism are found wanting the former for its condescending approach to nonhuman others the latter in view of the hypocritical denial of humans manipulative mastery over animals This critique is expanded to the destructive side of human individualism that entails selﬁ shness and a misplaced sense of superiority which for feminists Donovan and Adams 1996 2007 is connected to male privileges and the oppression of women and supports a general theory of male domination Meateating is targeted as a legalized form of cannibalism by old and new feminist vegetarian and vegan critical theory Adams 1990 MacCormack 2012 Species ism is therefore held accountable as an undue privilege to the same degree as sexism and racism The pervasiveness of a sexspecies hierarchical system tends to remain unacknowl edged and uncriticized even in the framework of animal rights activism The corrective inﬂ uence of feminism is valued because it emphasizes both the political importance of the collectivity and of emotional bonding New analytic data on the status of animals is currently being analysed through the interdisciplinary tools of anthro pology primatology palaeontology science and technology studies One of the most prominent postanthropocentric neohumanists in this ﬁ eld is Frans de Waal 1996 who extends classical humanist values like empathy and moral responsibility to the upper primates On the basis of rigorous empirical observation of the great apes de Waal transformed PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species our thinking about evolution and evolutionary psychology by challenging the emphasis on aggression as the motor of species development De Waals groundbreaking work on our inner ape and the bonobos located communication and sexual exchange at the core of community formation striking also a note in support of the evolutionary role of the females of species In his more recent work de Waal 2009 stresses the importance of empathy as a form of emotional commu nication or emotionally mediated communication among nonhuman primates The emphasis on empathy accomplishes several signiﬁ cant goals in view of a posthuman theory of subjectivity Firstly it reappraises communication as an evolutionary tool Sec ondly it identiﬁ es in emotions rather than in reason the key to consciousness Thirdly it develops what Harry Kunneman has deﬁ ned as a hermeneutical form of naturalism which takes critical distance from the tradition of social constructiv ism and situates moral values as innate qualities This is a signiﬁ cant addition to the theory of the natureculture con tinuum Our species argues de Waal is obligatorily gregari ous 2006 4 Moreover de Waals view of the subject is materialist as opposed to the transcendence of reason and attracted to David Humes approach to the emotions or pas sions as key to identity formation Last but not least I would suggest that Frans de Waal is a postanthropocentric social democrat who is very committed to the creation of social infrastructures of generosity and reciprocal altruism and support His idea that moral goodness is contagious is sup ported by the mirror neurons theory of empathy The emphasis falls on the ethical continuity between humans and upper primates arguing that it is a bit too easy to project our aggressive tendencies onto the animals and reserve the quality of goodness as a prerogative of our species De Waal 1996 argues that evolution has also provided the requisites for morality and attacks the anthropodenial 2006 xvi of human supremacists Empathy as an innate and genetically transmitted moral tendency or the naturalization of morals is in fashion whereas selﬁ sh genes and greed are deﬁ nitely out All these aspects are extremely relevant for a posthuman theory of the subject The reason why I am somewhat sceptical of postanthro pocentric neohumanism however is that it is rather uncriti PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species cal about Humanism itself The compensatory efforts on behalf of animals generate what I consider as a belated kind of solidarity between the human dwellers of this planet cur rently traumatized by globalization technology and the new wars and their animal others It is at best an ambivalent phenomenon in that it combines a negative sense of cross species bonding with classical and rather highminded human ist moral claims In this crossspecies embrace Humanism is actually being reinstated uncritically under the aegis of species egalitarianism In my work on the posthuman subject I choose not to leave aside the critical acknowledgement of the limitations of Humanism as outlined in the previous chapter I am also sharply aware of the fact that we live in the era of the anthro pocene that is to say an age when the earths ecological balance is directly regulated by humanity I think that at such a time of deep epistemological ethical and political crises of values in human societies extending the privileges of human ist values to other categories can hardly be considered as a selﬂ ess and generous or a particularly productive move Asserting a vital bond between the humans and other species is both necessary and ﬁ ne This bond is negative in that it is the effect of shared vulnerability which is itself a consequence of human actions upon the environment Is it not the case then that the humans have spread to nonhumans their fun damental anxiety about the future The humanization of nonhuman animals may therefore come at a price especially at a historical time when the very category of the human has become challenged Anthropomorphizing them so as to extend to animals the principle of moral and legal equality may be a noble gesture but it is inherently ﬂ awed on two scores Firstly it conﬁ rms the binary distinction humananimal by benevolently extend ing the hegemonic category the human towards the others Secondly it denies the speciﬁ city of animals altogether because it uniformly takes them as emblems of the trans species universal ethical value of empathy In my view the point about posthuman relations however is to see the inter relation humananimal as constitutive of the identity of each It is a transformative or symbiotic relation that hybridizes and alters the nature of each one and foregrounds the middle grounds of their interaction This is the milieu of the human PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species nonhuman continuum and it needs to be explored as an open experiment not as a foregone moral conclusion about alleg edly universal values or qualities The middle ground of that particular interaction has to remain normatively neutral in order to allow for new parameters to emerge for the becom inganimal of anthropos a subject that has been encased for much too long in the mould of species supremacy Intensive spaces of becoming have to be opened and more importantly to be kept open In an era when natural offspring are being replaced by corporate brands and manufactured and patented bio products the ethical imperative to bind to them and be accountable for their wellbeing remains as strong as ever We need new genealogies alternative theoretical and legal repre sentations of the new kinship system and adequate narratives to live up to this challenge I hope my vision of posthuman subjectivity can insert more conceptual creativity into critical theory and thus work towards an afﬁ rmative brand of post human thought In the universe that I inhabit as a post industrial subject of socalled advanced capitalism there is a great deal of familiarity and hence much in common in the way of embodied and embedded locations between female humans oncomouse and the cloned sheep Dolly I owe as much to the genetically engineered members of the former animal kingdom as to humanistic ideals of the uniqueness of my species Similarly my situated position as a female of the species makes me structurally serviceable and thus closer to the organisms that are willing or unwilling providers of organs or cells than to any notion of the inviolability and integrity of the human species I know that this may sound impatient and even reckless but I stand by it that in me which no longer identiﬁ es with the dominant categories of subjectivity but which is not yet completely out of the cage of identity that is to say that which goes on differing is at home with zoe the postanthropocen tric subject These rebellious components for me are related to the feminist consciousness of what it means to be embod ied female As such I am a shewolf a breeder that multiplies cells in all directions I am an incubator and a carrier of vital and lethal viruses I am motherearth the generator of the future In the political economy of phallogocentrism and of PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species anthropocentric humanism which predicates the sovereignty of Sameness in a falsely universalistic mode my sex fell on the side of Otherness understood as pejorative difference or as beingworthlessthan The becomingposthuman speaks to my feminist self partly because my sex historically speak ing never quite made it into full humanity so my allegiance to that category is at best negotiable and never to be taken for granted The Posthuman as Becomingearth The displacement of anthropocentrism results in a drastic restructuring of humans relation to animals but critical theory may be able to adjust itself to the challenge mostly by building on the multiple imaginary and affective ties that have consolidated humananimal interaction The post anthropocentric shift towards a planetary geocentred per spective however is a conceptual earthquake of an altogether different scale than the becominganimal of Man This event is sending seismic waves across the ﬁ eld of the Humanities and critical theory Claire Colebrook with her customary wit calls it a critical climate change5 In the age of anthropocene the phenomenon known as geomorphism is usually expressed in negative terms as environmental crisis climate change and ecological sustain ability Yet there is also a more positive dimension to it in the sense of reconﬁ guring the relationship to our complex habitat which we used to call nature The earth or planetary dimension of the environmental issue is indeed not a concern like any other It is rather the issue that is immanent to all others in so far as the earth is our middle and common ground This is the milieu for all of us human and non human inhabitant of this particular planet in this particular era The planetary opens onto the cosmic in an immanent materialist dimension My argument is that again this change of perspective is rich in alternatives for a renewal of subjectiv ity What would a geocentred subject look like 5 This is the title of the online book series that Colebrook edits for the Open Humanities Press PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species The starting point for me remains the natureculture con tinuum but by now we need to insert into this framework the monistic insight that as Lloyd put it we are all part of nature 1994 This statement which she frames in a monis tic ontology based on Spinozas philosophy is sobering as well as inspiring It is further complicated for us citizens of the third millennium by the fact that we actually inhabit a natureculture continuum which is both technologically mediated and globally enforced This means that we cannot assume a theory of subjectivity that takes for granted natu ralistic foundationalism nor can we rely on a social construc tivist and hence dualistic theory of the subject which disavows the ecological dimension Instead critical theory needs to fulﬁ l potentially contradictory requirements The ﬁ rst is to develop a dynamic and sustainable notion of vitalist selforganizing materiality the second is to enlarge the frame and scope of subjectivity along the transversal lines of postanthropocentric relations I outlined in the previous section The idea of subjectivity as an assemblage that includes nonhuman agents has a number of consequences Firstly it implies that subjectivity is not the exclusive prerogative of anthropos secondly that it is not linked to transcendental reason thirdly that it is unhinged from the dialectics of rec ognition and lastly that it is based on the immanence of relations The challenge for critical theory is momentous we need to visualize the subject as a transversal entity encom passing the human our genetic neighbours the animals and the earth as a whole and to do so within an understandable language Let us pause on the latter for a minute as it raises the issue of representation which is crucial for the Humanities and for critical theory Finding an adequate language for postanthropocentrism means that the resources of the imag ination as well as the tools of critical intelligence need to be enlisted for this task The collapse of the natureculture divide requires that we need to devise a new vocabulary with new ﬁ gurations to refer to the elements of our posthuman embodied and embedded subjectivity The limitations of the social constructivist method show up here and need to be compensated by more conceptual creativity Most of us who were trained in social theory however have experienced at PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species elements of our subjectivity may not be totally socially con structed Part of the legacy of the Marxist Left consists in fact in a deeply rooted suspicion towards the natural order and green politics As if this mistrust of the natural were not enough we also need to reconceptualize the relation to the technological arte fact as something as intimate as close as nature used to be The technological apparatus is our new milieu and this intimacy is far more complex and generative than the pros thetic mechanical extension that modernity had made of it Throughout this change of parameters I also want to be ever mindful of the importance of the politics of locations and keep investigating who exactly is the we who is positing all these queries in the ﬁ rst place This new scheme for rethinking posthuman subjectivity is as rich as it is complex but it is grounded in reallife worldhistorical conditions that are confronting us with pressing urgency Dipesh Chakrabarty 2009 addresses some of these con cerns by investigating the consequences of the climate change debate for the practice of history He argues that the scholar ship on climate change causes both spatial and temporal difﬁ culties It brings about a change of scale in our thinking which now needs to encompass a planetary or geocentred dimension acknowledging that humans are larger than a biological entity and now wield a geological force It also shifts the temporal parameters away from the expectation of continuity which sustains the discipline of history to contem plate the idea of extinction that is to say a future without us Furthermore these shifts in the basic parameters also affect the content of historical research by destroying the artiﬁ cial but time honoured distinction between natural and human histories Chakrabarty 2009 206 Although Chakrabarty does not take the postanthropocentric path he comes to the same conclusion as I do the issue of geocentred perspectives and the change of location of humans from mere biological to geological agents calls for recompositions of both subjectivity and community The geocentred turn also has other serious political impli cations The ﬁ rst concerns the limitations of classical Human ism in the Enlightenment model Relying on postcolonial PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species theory Chakrabarty points out that the philosophers of freedom were mainly and understandably concerned with how humans would escape the injustice oppression inequal ity or even uniformity foisted on them by other humans or humanmade systems 2009 208 Their anthropocentrism coupled with a culturespeciﬁ c notion of Humanism limits their relevance today The climate change issue and the spectre of human extinction also affect the analytic strategies that postcolonial and postimperial historians have deployed in the last two decades in response to the postwar scenario of decol onization and globalization Chakrabarty 2009 198 I would add that the social constructivist approach of Marxist feminist and postcolonial analyses does not completely equip them to deal with the change of spatial and temporal scale engendered by the postanthropocentric or geocentred shift This insight is the core of the radical postanthropocentric position I want to defend which I see as a way of updating critical theory for the third millennium Many scholars are coming to the same conclusion through different routes For instance postanthropocentric neo humanist traditions of socialist or of standpoint feminist theories Harding 1986 and of postcolonial theory Shiva 1997 have approached the issues of environmentalism in a postanthropocentric or at least nonandrocentric or non maledominated manner as we saw in the previous chapter This critique of anthropocentrism is expressed in the name of ecological awareness with strong emphasis on the experi ence of social minorities like women and of nonWestern peoples The recognition of multicultural perspectives and the critique of imperialism and ethnocentrism add a crucial aspect to the discussion on the becomingearth but nowadays they also fall in their own internal contradictions Let us take for instance the case of deep ecology Arne Naess 1977a 1977b and James Lovelocks Gaia hypoth esis 1979 are geocentred theories that propose a return to holism and to the notion of the whole earth as a single sacred organism This holistic approach is rich in perspectives but also quite problematic for a vitalist materialist posthuman thinker What is problematic about it is less the holistic part than the fact that it is based on a social constructivist dualistic method This means that it opposes the earth to industrializa PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species tion nature to culture the environment to society and comes down ﬁ rmly on the side of the natural order This results in a relevant political agenda that is critical of consumerism and possessive individualism including a strong indictment of technocratic reason and technological culture But this approach has two drawbacks Firstly its technophobic aspect is not particularly helpful in itself considering the world we are living in Secondly it paradoxically reinstates the very categorical divide between the natural and the manufactured which it is attempting to overcome Why do I not agree with this position Because of two interrelated ideas ﬁ rstly because of the natureculture con tinuum and the subsequent rejection of the dualistic method ology of social constructivism  the postanthropocentric neohumanists end up reinstating this distinction albeit with the best of intentions in relation to the natural order sec ondly because I am suspicious of the negative kind of bonding going on in the age of anthropocene between humans and nonhumans The transspecies embrace is based on the awareness of the impending catastrophe the environmental crisis and the global warmning issue not to speak of the militarization of space reduce all species to a comparable degree of vulnerability The problem with this position is that in ﬂ agrant contradiction with its explicitly stated aims it promotes fullscale humanization of the environment This strikes me as a regressive move reminiscent of the sentimen tality of the Romantic phases of European culture I concur therefore with Val Plumwoods 1993 2003 assessment that deep ecology misreads the earthcosmos nexus and merely expands the structures of possessive egoism and selfinterests to include nonhuman agents Signiﬁ cantly while the holistic approach also makes refer ence to Spinozas monism it steers clear of contemporary rereadings of Spinoza by the likes of Deleuze and Guattari Foucault or other radical branches of Continental philoso phy Spinozas idea of the unity of mind and soul is applied in support of the belief that all that lives is holy and the greatest respect is due to it This idolatry of the natural order is linked to Spinozas vision of God and the unity between man and nature It stresses the harmony between the human and the ecological habitat in order to propose a sort of syn PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species thesis of the two Deep ecology is therefore spiritually charged in an essentialist way Because there are no boundaries and everything is interrelated to hurt nature is ultimately to hurt ourselves Thus the earth environment as a whole deserves the same ethical and political consideration as humans This position is helpful but it strikes me as a way of humanizing the environment that is to say as a wellmeaning form of residual anthropomorphic normativity applied to nonhuman planetary agents Compensatory Humanism is a twofaced position In contrast with this position but also building on some of its premises I would like to propose an updated brand of Spinozism Citton and Lordon 2008 I see Spinozist monism and the radical immanent forms of critique that rest upon it as a democratic move that promotes a kind of ontological paciﬁ sm Species equality in a postanthropocentric world does urge us to question the violence and the hierarchical thinking that result from human arrogance and the assump tion of transcendental human exceptionalism In my view monistic relationality stresses instead the more compassion ate aspect of subjectivity A Spinozist approach reread with Deleuze and Guattari allows us to bypass the pitfalls of binary thinking and to address the environmental question in its full complexity Contemporary monism implies a notion of vital and selforganizing matter as we saw in the previous chapter as well as a nonhuman deﬁ nition of Life as zoe or a dynamic and generative force It is about the embodiment of the mind and the embrainment of the body Marks 1998 Deleuze also refers to this vital energy as the great animal the cosmic machine not in any mechanistic or utilitarian way but in order to avoid any reference to biological deter minism on the one hand and overinﬂ ated psychologized indi vidualism on the other Deleuze and Guattari 1987 also use the term Chaos to refer to that roar of cosmic energy which most of us would rather ignore They are careful to point out however that Chaos is not chaotic but it rather contains the inﬁ nite expanse of all virtual forces These potentialities are real in so far as they call for actualization through pragmatic and sustainable practices To mark this close connection between the virtual and the real they turn to literature and borrow from James Joyce the neologism chaosmos This is PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species a condensation of chaos and cosmos that expresses the source of eternal energy Again the issue of language and representation comes up in this seemingly abstruse choice of terms What I ﬁ nd praise worthy on the part of my critical theory teachers is the extent to which they are willing to take the risk of ridicule by experi menting with language that shocks established habits and deliberately provokes imaginative and emotional reactions The point of critical theory is to upset common opinion doxa not to conﬁ rm it Although this approach has met with hostile reception in academia as we shall see in chapter 4 I see it as a gesture of generous and deliberate risktaking and hence as a statement in favour of academic freedom I consequently experiment with my own alternative ﬁ gura tions ranging from the nomadic subject to other conceptual personae that help me navigate across the stormy waters of the postanthropocentric predicament Rigorously material ist my own nomadic thought defends a postindividualistic notion of the subject which is marked by a monistic rela tional structure Yet it is not undifferentiated in terms of the social coordinates of class gender sexuality ethnicity and race Nomadic subjectivity is the social branch of complexity theory Where does this leave our becomingearth Actually we are in the middle of it Let us resume the argument from the idea of the posthuman subject You may remember that the recomposition of a negatively indexed new idea of the human as an endangered species alongside other nonhuman categories is currently celebrated by postanthropocentric neohumanists of all sorts from animal rights activists to ecofeminists They take the environmental crisis as evidence of the need to reinstate universal humanist values I have no real quarrels with the moral aspiration that drives this process and share the same ethical longing I am however seriously worried about the limitations of an uncritical reassertion of Humanism as the binding factor of this reactively assumed notion of a panhuman bond I want to stress that the aware ness of a new negatively indexed reconstruction of some thing we call humanity must not be allowed to ﬂ atten out or dismiss all the power differentials that are still enacted and operationalized through the axes of sexualizationracializa PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species tionnaturalization just as they are being reshufﬂ ed by the spinning machine of advanced biogenetic capitalism Criti cal theory needs to think simultaneously the blurring of cat egorical differences and their reassertion as new forms of biopolitical biomediated political economy with familiar patterns of exclusion and domination For instance in his analysis of the double limitations of both classical Humanism and Marxist oriented and postcolonial theory Dipesh Chakrabarty raises a very pertinent question if you consider the difference in carbon print between richer and poorer nations is it really fair to speak of the climate change crisis as a common human concern I would push this further and ask is it not risky to accept the construction of a negative formation of humanity as a category that stretches to all human beings all other differences notwithstanding Those differences do exist and continue to matter so what are we to make of them The process of becomingearth points to a qualitatively different planetary relation The question of differences leads us back to power and to the politics of locations and the necessity of an ethicalpolit ical theory of subjectivity namely who exactly is the we of this panhumanity bonded in fear of a common threat Chakrabarty puts it lucidly Species may indeed be the name of a paceholder for an emergent new universal history of humans that ﬂ ashes up the moment of the danger that is climate change 2009 222 As a result I would argue that critical theorists need to strike a rigorous and coherent note of resistance against the neutralization of difference that is induced by the perverse materiality and the tendentious mobility of advanced capitalism A more egalitarian road in a zoecentred way requires a modicum of goodwill on the part of the dominant party in this case anthropos himself towards his nonhuman others I am aware of course that this is asking a lot The post anthropocentric shift away from the hierarchical relations that had privileged Man requires a form of estrangement and a radical repositioning on the part of the subject The best method to accomplish this is through the strategy of de familiarization or critical distance from the dominant vision of the subject Disidentiﬁ cation involves the loss of familiar habits of thought and representation in order to pave the way PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species for creative alternatives Deleuze would call it an active deterritorialization Race and postcolonial theories have also made important contributions to the methodology and the political strategy of defamiliarization Gilroy 2005 I have defended this method as a disidentiﬁ cation from famil iar and hence normative values such as the dominant institu tions and representations of femininity and masculinity so as to move sexual difference towards the process of becoming minoritarian Braidotti 1994 2011a In a similar vein Spi nozist feminist thinkers like Moira Gatens and Genevieve Lloyd 1999 argue that socially embedded and historically grounded changes require a qualitative shift of our collective imaginings or a shared desire for transformations The con ceptual frame of reference I have adopted for the method of defamiliarization is monism It implies the openended inter relational multisexed and transspecies ﬂ ows of becoming through interaction with multiple others A posthuman subject thus constituted exceeds the boundaries of both anthropocentrism and of compensatory humanism to acquire a planetary dimension The Posthuman as Becomingmachine The issue of technology is central to the postanthropocentric predicament and it has already come out several times in the previous sections The relationship between the human and the technological other has shifted in the contemporary context to reach unprecedented degrees of intimacy and intrusion The posthuman predicament is such as to force a displacement of the lines of demarcation between structural differences or ontological categories for instance between the organic and the inorganic the born and the manufac tured ﬂ esh and metal electronic circuits and organic nervous systems As in the case of humananimal relations the move is beyond metaphorization The metaphorical or analogue func tion that machinery fulﬁ lled in modernity as an anthropo centric device that imitated embodied human capacities is replaced today by a more complex political economy that connects bodies to machines more intimately through simu PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species lation and mutual modiﬁ cation As Andreas Huyssen 1986 has argued in the electronic era wires and circuitry exercise another kind of seduction than the pistons and grinding engines of industrial machinery Electronic machines are from this angle quite immaterial plastic boxes and metal wires that convey information They do not represent any thing but rather carry clear instructions and can reproduce clear information patterns The main thrust of microelec tronic seduction is actually neural in that it foregrounds the fusion of human consciousness with the general electronic network Contemporary information and communication technologies exteriorize and duplicate electronically the human nervous system This has prompted a shift in our ﬁ eld of perception the visual modes of representation have been replaced by sensorialneuronal modes of simulation As Patri cia Clough puts it we have become biomediated bodies 2008 3 We can therefore safely start from the assumption that the cyborgs are the dominant social and cultural formations that are active throughout the social fabric with many economic and political implications The Vitruvian Man has gone cybernetic see ﬁ gure 24 Let me qualify this statement by adding that all technologies can be said to have a strong bio political effect upon the embodied subject they intersect with Thus cyborgs include not only the glamorous bodies of high tech jetﬁ ghter pilots athletes or ﬁ lm stars but also the anonymous masses of the underpaid digital proletariat who fuel the technologydriven global economy without ever accessing it themselves Braidotti 2006 I shall return to this cruel political economy in the next chapter What I want to argue next is that technological mediation is central to a new vision of posthuman subjectivity and that it provides the grounding for new ethical claims A posthu man notion of the enﬂ eshed and extended relational self keeps the technohype in check by a sustainable ethics of transformations This sober position pleads for resistance to both the fatal attraction of nostalgia and the fantasy of trans humanist and other technoutopias It also juxtaposes the rhetoric of the desire to be wired to a more radical sense of the materialism of proud to be ﬂ esh Sobchack 2004 The emphasis on immanence allows us to respect the bond of mutual dependence between bodies and technological PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species others while avoiding the contempt for the ﬂ esh and the transhumanist fantasy of escape from the ﬁ nite materiality of the enﬂ eshed self As we shall see in the next chapter the issue of death and mortality will be raised by necessity I want to argue for a vitalist view of the technologically biomediated other This machinic vitality is not so much about determinism inbuilt purpose or ﬁ nality but rather about becoming and transformation This introduces a process that Deleuze and Guattari call becomingmachine inspired by the Surrealists bachelor machines meaning a playful and pleasureprone relationship to technology that is not based on functionalism For Deleuze this is linked to the project of releasing human embodiment from its indexation Figure 24 Victor Habbick Maninblack Robot in the style of Leonardos Vitruvian Man Source Clivia  Pixmac PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species on socialized productivity to become bodies without organs that is to say without organized efﬁ ciency This is no hippy like insurrection of the senses but rather a carefully thought through programme that pursues two aims Firstly it attempts to rethink our bodies as part of a natureculture continuum in their indepth structures Secondly it adds a political dimension by setting the framework of recomposition of bodily materiality in directions diametrically opposed to the spurious efﬁ ciency and ruthless opportunism of advanced capitalism Contemporary machines are no metaphors but they are engines or devices that both capture and process forces and energies facilitating interrelations multiple con nections and assemblages They stand for radical relationality and delight as well as productivity The becomingmachine understood in this speciﬁ c sense indicates and actualizes the relational powers of a subject that is no longer cast in a dualistic frame but bears a privileged bond with multiple others and merges with ones technologi cally mediated planetary environment The merger of the human with the technological results in a new transversal compound a new kind of ecosophical unity not unlike the symbiotic relationship between the animal and its planetary habitat This is not the holistic fusion that Hegel accused Spinoza of but rather radical transversal relations that gener ate new modes of subjectivity held in check by an ethology of forces They sustain a vitalist ethics of mutual transspecies interdependence It is a generalized ecology also known as ecosophy which aims at crossing transversally the multiple layers of the subject from interiority to exteriority and every thing in between This process is what I mean by postanthropocentric posthumanism which I defend throughout this book It involves a radical estrangement from notions like moral ratio nality unitary identity transcendent consciousness or innate and universal moral values The focus is entirely on the nor matively neutral relational structures of both subject forma tion and of possible ethical relations The elaboration of new normative frameworks for the posthuman subject is the focus of collectively enacted nonproﬁ toriented experimentations with intensity that is to say with what we are actually capable of becoming They are a praxis a grounded shared project PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species not a doxa common sense belief My own concept of nomadic subject embodies this approach which combines nonunitary subjectivity with ethical accountability by fore grounding the ontological role played by relationality According to Felix Guattari the posthuman predicament calls for a new virtual social ecology which includes social political ethical and aesthetic dimensions and transversal links between them To clarify this vision Guattari proposes three fundamental ecologies that of the environment of the social nexus and of the psyche More importantly he empha sizes the need to create transversal lines through all three of them This clariﬁ cation is important and I would connect it to the theoretical reminder I issued earlier namely that we need to practise defamiliarization as a crucial method in posthuman critical theory and learn to think differently It is crucial for instance to see the interconnections among the greenhouse effect the status of women racism and xeno phobia and frantic consumerism We must not stop at any fragmented portions of these realities but rather trace trans versal interconnections among them The subject is ontologi cally polyvocal It rests on a plane of consistency including both the real that is already actualized territorialized exis tential territories and the real that is still virtual deterrito rialized incorporeal universes Guattari 1995 26 Guattari calls for a collective reappropriation of the production of subjectivity through chaosmic desegregation of the differ ent categories You may remember that Chaosmos is the universe of reference for becoming in the sense of the unfold ing of virtualities or transformative values A qualitative step forward is necessary if we want subjectivity to escape the regime of commodiﬁ cation that is the trait of our historical era and experiment with virtual possibilities We need to become the sorts of subjects who actively desire to reinvent subjectivity as a set of mutant values and to draw our plea sure from that not from the perpetuation of familiar regimes The work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela 1972 is a great source of inspiration in redesigning this type of environmentally bound postanthropocentric and non Kantian ethics of codetermination between self and other The notion of codependence replaces that of recognition much as the ethics of sustainability replaces the moral phi PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species losophy of rights This reiterates the importance of grounded situated and very speciﬁ c and hence accountable perspectives in a move that I call zoecentred egalitarianism In his analysis of the collective existential mutations 1995 2 currently taking place Felix Guattari refers to Varelas distinction between autopoietic selforganizing and allopoietic systems Guattari moves beyond the distinction proposed by Varela by extending the principle of autopoiesis which for Varela is reserved for the biological organisms to cover also the machines or technological others Another name for subjectivity according to Guattari is autopoietic subjectivation or selfstyling and it accounts both for living organisms humans as selforganizing systems and also for inorganic matter the machines Guattaris machinic autopoiesis establishes a qualitative link between organic matter and technological or machinic artefacts This results in a radical redeﬁ nition of machines as both intelligent and generative They have their own tempo rality and develop through generations they contain their own virtuality and futurity Consequently they entertain their own forms of alterity not only towards humans but also among themselves and aim to create metastability which is the precondition of individuation The emphasis on selforga nization and metastability frames the project of becoming machine of the posthuman subject It helps us rethink transversal technologically mediated subjectivity while avoid ing scientiﬁ c reductionism In his critique of the rhetoric of biotechnological vitalism 1997 Ansell Pearson warns us against the pernicious fantasy of a renaturalized notion of evolution mediated by advanced biotechnological capital ism I think that the point of the posthuman predicament is to rethink evolution in a nondeterministic but also a post anthropocentric manner In opposition to classical linear teleological ideas of evolution Chardin de Teillard 1959 I want to emphasize instead the collective project of seeking a more adequate understanding of the complexity of factors that structure the posthuman subject the new proximity to animals the planetary dimension and the high level of tech nological mediation Machinic autopoiesis means that the technological is a site of postanthropocentric becoming or the threshold to many possible worlds PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species The key notion is the transversality of relations for a postanthropocentric and posthuman subject that traces trans versal connections among material and symbolic concrete and discursive lines of relation or forces Transversality actu alizes zoecentred egalitarianism as an ethics and also as a method to account for forms of alternative posthuman sub jectivity An ethics based on the primacy of the relation of interdependence values zoe in itself I also refer to these practices of becomingmachine as radical neomaterialism Braidotti 1991 or as matter realism Fraser et al 2006 These ideas are supported by and intersect with changing understandings of the conceptual structure of matter itself De Landa 2002 Bennett 2010 under the impact of contemporary biogenetics and informa tion technologies The Spinozist switch to a monistic political ontology stresses processes vital politics and nondetermin istic evolutionary theories Politically the emphasis falls accordingly on the micropolitics of relations as a posthu manist ethics that traces transversal connections among mate rial and symbolic concrete and discursive lines or forces The focus is on the force and autonomy of affect and the logistics of its actualization Massumi 2002 Transversality actual izes an ethics based on the primacy of the relation of inter dependence which values nonhuman or apersonal Life This is what I call posthuman politics Braidotti 2006 Difference as the Principle of NotOne Let me take stock of how far we have come in the complex debate opened by the demise of anthropos Firstly I have argued that contemporary capitalism is biopolitical in that it aims at controlling all that lives It has already turned into a form of biopiracy Shiva 1997 because it exploits the generative powers of women animals plants genes and cells Secondly this means that human and anthropomorphic others are relocated in a continuum with nonanthropomor phic animal or earth others The categorical distinction that separated the Human from his naturalized others has shifted taking the humanist assumptions about what constitutes the basic unit of reference for the human into a spin Thirdly PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species this anthropocentric process produces a negative category of the human as an endangered species bound by fear of extinc tion It also forces a new unity among the human and other species in the form of compensatory extension of humanist values and rights to the nonhuman others Fourthly the same system perpetuates familiar patterns of exclusion exploitation and oppression In order to ground my claim about the advantages of a posthuman subject position based on relationality and transversal interconnections across the classical axes of differentiation the next step of the argument needs to address the question of difference I will look criti cally at the status and function of difference in this new post anthropocentric landscape As I argued in the previous chapter the most striking feature of the current scientiﬁ c redeﬁ nition of matter is the dislocation of difference from binaries to rhizomatics from sexgender or natureculture to processes of sexualization racializationnaturalization that take Life itself or the vitality of matter as the main target This system engenders a deliber ate blurring of dichotomous differences which does not in itself resolve or improve the power differences and in many ways increases them In other words the opportunistic post anthropocentric effects of the global economy engender a negative cosmopolitanism or a sense of reactive panhuman bonding by introducing the notion of Life as surplus and of a common human vulnerability The political line of questioning has to start from this ﬁ rm location to raise some key questions about subjectivity For instance Katherine Hayles argues What do gendered bodies have to do with the erasure of embodiment and the subse quent merging of machine and human intelligence in the ﬁ gure of the cyborg Hayles 1999 xii In a similar vein Balsamo who believes that bodies are always and already marked by gender and race asks 1996 6 When the human body is fractured into organs ﬂ uids and genetic codes what happens to gender identity When the body is fractured into functional parts and molecular codes where is gender located Let us trust women gays lesbians and other alter native forces with their historically leaky bodies Grosz 1994 and not fully human rights to both reassert the powers and enhance the potentiality of the posthuman organism as generative wetware PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species the contemporary classiﬁ cation of embodied subjects As I argued previously bodies are reduced to their informational substrate in terms of materiality and vital capacity By impli cation this means that the markers for the organization and distribution of differences are now located in micro instances of vital materiality like the cells of living organisms and the genetic codes of entire species We have come a long way from the gross system that used to mark difference on the basis of visually veriﬁ able anatomical differences between the empirical sexes the races and the species We have moved from the biopower that Foucault exempliﬁ ed by comparative anatomy to a society based on the governance of molecular zoe power of today We have equally shifted from disciplinary to control societies from the political economy of the Pan opticon to the informatics of domination Haraway 1990 1992 2003 The question of difference and power disparity however remains as central as ever This posthuman political landscape is not necessarily more egalitarian or less racist and heterosexist in its commitment to uphold for instance conservative gender roles and family values albeit  in the case of the Hollywood blockbusters like Avatar 2009  of the intergalactic and alien kind The power of contemporary technoculture to destabilize the categorical axes of difference exacerbates power relations and brings them to new necropolitical heights as we shall see in the next chapter It also results in some misleading tendencies like technotranscendence that coupled with a consumeroriented brand of liberal individualism emerge as one of the traits of the social imaginary of global capitalism What are the consequences of the fact that technological apparatus is no longer sexualized racialized or naturalized but rather neutralized as ﬁ gures of mixity hybridity and interconnectiveness turning transsexuality into a dominant posthuman topos If the machine is both selforganizing and transgender the old organic human body needs to be relo cated elsewhere Ever mindful of Lyotards warning about the political economy of advanced capitalism I think we should not trust the blurring effects and states of indeterminacy it engenders However tempting it would be misguided to assume that posthuman embodied subjects are beyond sexual PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species or racialized difference The politics of representation and hence the location of sexualized racialized and naturalized differences are still strongly in place though they have shifted signiﬁ cantly Bukatman 1993 In the electronic frontier as we saw earlier the technologically mediated point of refer ence is neither organicinorganic malefemale nor especially white Advanced capitalism is a postgender system capable of accommodating a high degree of androgyny and a signiﬁ  cant blurring of the categorical divide between the sexes It is also a postracial system that no longer classiﬁ es people and their cultures on grounds of pigmentation Gilroy 2000 but remains nonetheless profoundly racist A strong theory of posthuman subjectivity can help us to reappropriate these processes both theoretically and politically not only as ana lytical tools but also as alternative grounds for formations of the self Sexualized racialized and naturalized differences from being categorical boundary markers under Humanism have become unhinged and act as the forces leading to the elabora tion of alternative modes of transversal subjectivity which extend not only beyond gender and race but also beyond the human In my view posthuman ecophilosophy functions as an attempt to rethink in a materialist manner the intricate web of interrelations that mark the contemporary subjects relationship to their multiple ecologies the natural the social and the psychic as Guattari indicates More importantly for the sake of the current argument they do not abolish but profoundly restructure the processes of sexualization racial ization and naturalization which provided the pillars of bio political governmentality In terms of feminist politics this means we need to rethink sexuality without genders starting from a vitalist return to the polymorphous and according to Freud perverse in the sense of playful and nonreproductive structure of human sexuality We also need to reassess the generative powers of female embodiment In this vision gender is just a historically contingent mechanism of capture of the multiple potentiali ties of the body including their generative or reproductive capacities To turn it into the transhistorical matrix of power as suggested by queer theory in the linguistic and social con structivist tradition Butler 1991 is quite simply a concep PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species tual error From the perspective of a posthuman monist political economy power is a not a static given but a complex strategic ﬂ ow of effects which call for a pragmatic politics of intervention and the quest for sustainable alternatives Braid otti 2006 In other words we need to experiment with resistance and intensity in order to ﬁ nd out what posthuman bodies can do Because the gender system captures the com plexity of human sexuality in a binary machine that privileges heterosexual family formations and literally steals all other possible bodies from us we no longer know what sexed bodies can do We therefore need to rediscover the notion of the sexual complexity that marks sexuality in its human and posthuman forms A postanthropocentric approach makes it clear that bodily matter in the human as in other species is always already sexed and hence sexually differentiated along the axes of multiplicity and heterogeneity I have argued that matterrealist or posthuman vitalist feminism resting on a dynamic monistic political ontology shifts the focus away from the sexgender distinction bring ing sexuality as process into full focus This means by exten sion that sexuality is a force or constitutive element that is capable of deterritorializing gender identity and institutions Braidotti 1994 Combined with the idea of the body as an incorporeal complex assemblage of virtualities this approach posits the ontological priority of difference and its selftrans forming force Claire Colebrook 2000 for instance argues that sexual difference is not a problem that needs a solution but a productive location to start from Patricia MacCormack 2008 similarly draws attention to the need to return to sexuality as a polymorphous and complex visceral force and to disengage it from both identity issues and all dualistic oppositions Posthuman feminists look for subversion not in counteridentity formations but rather in pure dislocations of identities via the perversion of standardized patterns of sexualized racialized and naturalized interaction These experiments with what sexed bodies can do however do not amount to saying that in the social sphere differences no longer matter or that the traditional power relations have actually improved On the contrary on a world scale extreme forms of polarized sexual difference are stronger than ever They get projected onto geopolitical relations creating bel PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species ligerent gendered visions of a clash of civilizations that is allegedly predicated in terms of womens and GLBT peoples rights as I argued in the previous chapter These reactionary manifestations of gender dichotomies are only part of the picture The broader picture indicates that the dislocation of the former system of marking differences makes it all the more urgent to reassert the concept of difference as both central and nonessentialistic I have stressed difference as the prin ciple of notOne that is to say as differing Braidotti 2002 as constitutive of the posthuman subject and elaborate post anthropocentric forms of ethical accountability to match it In my view posthuman ethics urges us to endure the principle of notOne at the indepth structures of our subjectivity by acknowledging the ties that bind us to the multiple others in a vital web of complex interrelations This ethical principle breaks up the fantasy of unity totality and oneness but also the master narratives of primordial loss incommensurable lack and irreparable separation What I want to emphasize instead in a more afﬁ rmative vein is the priority of the rela tion and the awareness that one is the effect of irrepressible ﬂ ows of encounters interactions affectivity and desire which one is not in charge of This humbling experience of notOneness which is consti tutive of the nonunitary subject anchors the subject in an ethical bond to alterity to the multiple and external others that are constitutive of that entity which out of laziness and habit we call the self Posthuman nomadic vital political theory stresses the productive aspects of the condition of not One that is to say a generative notion of complexity At the beginning there is always already a relation to an affective interactive entity endowed with intelligent ﬂ esh and an embodied mind ontological relationality A materialist poli tics of posthuman differences works by potential becomings that call for actualization They are enacted through collec tively shared communitybased praxis and are crucial to support the process of vitalist nonunitarian and yet account able recomposition of a missing people This is the we that is evoked and actualized by the postanthropocentric creation of a new panhumanity It expresses the afﬁ rmative ethical dimension of becomingposthuman as a gesture of collective PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species selfstyling It actualizes a community that is not bound negatively by shared vulnerability the guilt of ancestral communal violence or the melancholia of unpayable onto logical debts but rather by the compassionate acknowledge ment of their interdependence with multiple others most of which in the age of anthropocene are quite simply not anthropomorphic Conclusion In this chapter I have pursued a dual aim I provided an answer to the question of what the posthuman might be in a postanthropocentric perspective and argued the case for a posthuman theory that takes into account subjectivity The most serious political problems in postanthropocen tric theory arise from the instrumental alliance of biogenetic capitalism with individualism as a residual humanist deﬁ ni tion of the subject My view of posthuman thought is instead profoundly antiindividualistic and it consists in working within the belly of the beast resisting the myth of organicism and holistic harmony but also capitalist opportunism Kath erine Hayles 1999 286 makes a powerful intervention on contemporary posthuman bodies But the posthuman does not really mean the end of humanity It signals instead the end of a certain conception of the human    What is lethal is not the posthuman as such but the grafting of the posthuman onto a liberal humanist view of the self    Located within the dialectic of patternrandomness and grounded in embodied actuality rather than disembodied information the posthuman offers resources for rethinking the articulation of humans with intelligent machines Hayles attacks the classical humanistic notion that subjectiv ity must coincide with conscious agency in such a way as to avoid some of the mistakes of the humanist past notably the liberal vision of an autonomous subject whose manifest destiny is to dominate and control nature Hayles 1999 288 One of the risks of the hype that surrounds the post anthropocentric bodymachines is indeed that of recreating a PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species hard core unitary vision of the subject under the cover of pluralistic fragmentation We run the risk of reasserting tran scendence via technological meditation and of proposing a neouniversal machinic ethos In the language of posthuman critical theory this would produce the deception of a quan titative multiplicity which does not entail any qualitative shifts To avoid this pitfall which ﬁ ts in with the neoliberal euphoria and in order to enact qualitative transformations instead we need to be equally distanced from both hypedup disembodiment and fantasies of transhumanist escape and from reessentialized centralized notions of liberal individu alism I propose to reinscribe posthuman bodies into radical relationality including webs of power relations at the social psychic ecological and microbiological or cellular levels The postanthropocentrism of our science and our globalized and technologically mediated times makes it urgent to work towards a new technoscientiﬁ c democracy Haraway 1997 95 The status and the location of Humanism which was the theme of the previous chapter are central to this discussion of postanthropocentrism I tend to resist the political neu trality of critical social and science theorists who support an analytic form of postanthropocentrism and avoid or dismiss the question of subjectivity I maintain that the post anthropocentric subject rests also on the antihumanist project which means that I want to keep an equal distance from both the humanistic assumptions of the universal value of the unitary subject and the extreme forms of science driven posthumanism which dismiss the need for a subject altogether One needs at least some subject position this need not be either unitary or exclusively anthropocentric but it must be the site for political and ethical accountability for collective imaginaries and shared aspirations Philosophical investiga tions of alternative ways of accounting for the embedded and embodied nature of the subject are relevant to develop an approach to subjectivity worthy of the complexities of our age As I will argue more extensively in chapter 4 this discus sion reopens the question of the relationship between the two cultures the Humanities and Science My point is that the social studies of science Latour 1993 are not the only or PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species even the most useful tools of analysis for the complex phe nomena surrounding the postanthropocentric technobodies of advanced capitalism Let me get to this from another angle I have argued that zoeegalitarianism expresses the simultaneously materialist and vitalist force of life itself zoe as the generative power that ﬂ ows across all species The new transversal alliance across species and among posthuman subjects opens up unex pected possibilities for the recomposition of communities for the very idea of humanity and for ethical forms of belonging These are not conﬁ ned to negative bonding in terms of sharing the same planetary threats climate change environmental crisis or even extinction What I propose is a more afﬁ rmative approach to the redeﬁ nition of posthuman subjectivity as in the counter models of transversal relational nomadic assem blages we saw earlier in this chapter or the extended nature cultural self as an alternative to classical Humanist subjectivity in the previous chapter Many more models are thinkable and feasible if we collectively choose to experiment systemati cally with the project of what we the differently located posthuman subjects of the anthropocene era might be capable of becoming We all stand to gain by the acknowledgment of a post anthropocentric transversal structural link in the position of these embodied nonhuman subjects that were previously known as the others of the anthropocentric and humanistic Man The ethical part of the project concerns the creation of a new social nexus and new forms of social connection with these technoothers What kinds of bonds can be estab lished within the natureculture continuum of technologically mediated organisms and how can they be sustained Both kinship and ethical accountability need to be redeﬁ ned in such a way as to rethink links of affectivity and responsibility not only for nonanthropomorphic organic others but also for those technologically mediated newly patented creatures we are sharing our planet with In opposition to the nostalgic trend that is so dominant in contemporary politics but also opposing a tendency to mel ancholia on the part of the progressive Left Derrida 2001b Butler 2004a Gilroy 2005 I want to argue that the posthu man emphasis on lifezoe itself can engender afﬁ rmative poli PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species tics Critical postanthropocentrism generates new perspectives that go beyond panic and mourning and produce a more workable platform For one thing it produces a more ade quate cartography of our reallife conditions because it focuses with greater accuracy on the complexities of contem porary technologically mediated bodies and on social prac tices of human embodiment Furthermore this type of vital materialism unconstrained by clearcut distinctions between species composes the notion of zoe as a nonhuman yet gen erative lifeforce This posthuman approach moves beyond high cyber studies Haraway 1985 Hayles 1999 into post cyber materialism Braidotti 2002 and posthuman theory Braidotti 2006 A nomadic zoecentred approach connects human to nonhuman life so as to develop a comprehensive ecophilosophy of becoming This posthuman and postanthropocentric sensibility which draws on deep affective as well as intellectual resources also expresses my rejection of the principle of adequation to the doxa or commonly received normative image of thought The posthuman predicament in both the posthumanist and the postanthropocentric sense of the term drives home the idea that the activity of thinking needs to be experimental and even transgressive in combining critique with creativity As Deleuze and Guattari teach us thinking is about the inven tion of new concepts and new productive ethical relations In this respect theory is a form of organized estrangement from dominant values More clinical than critical posthuman theory cuts to the core of classical visions of subjectivity and works towards an expanded vision of vitalist transversal relational subjects Theory today is about coming to terms with unprecedented changes and transformations of the basic unit of reference for what counts as human This afﬁ rmative unprogrammed mutation can help actualize new concepts affects and planetary subject formations Just as we do not know what posthuman bodies can do we cannot even begin to guess what postanthropocentric embodied brains will actu ally be able to think up Chapter 3 The Inhuman Life beyond Death One of my favourite ﬁ lms is Marcel LHerbiers LInhumaine 1924 With sets designed by Fernand Léger and Robert MalletStevens it is a manifesto of expressionist elegance constructivist exuberance and futurist selfconﬁ dence What is inhuman in this masterful artwork is symptomatic of its own historical moment The ﬁ lm deals with the superhuman capacity of the female of our species to manipulate and control the course of human history and evolution A highly seductive alliance is struck between the female body and the accelerating powers of technology The ambivalence of fear and desire towards technology is recast in the mode of an ancestral patriarchal suspicion towards powerful women and women in positions of power The progressive promise as well as the destructive potential of the female bodymachine is held in close and calculated balance The technological artefact and the mechanic other are both gendered and eroticized in modernism and become the emblem of a technologydriven future Huyssen 1986 In yet another expressionist masterpiece Fritz Langs Metropo lis 1927 the heroine Maria is the demonical robot that perverts the course of history It is based on the futurist novel LEve future Future Eve Villiers de lIsleAdam 1977 which depicts the mechanical bodyother of the industrial revolution as an object of intense desire ﬂ esh turns to metal The Inhuman Life beyond Death to fuel capital growth Progress is visualized as a fantasy landscape where locomotives successfully drive the train of Western history through endless tunnels Both machinevamp and praying mantis both virginmother and pregnant suicide bomber LHerbiers character Claire in LInhumaine and Langs Maria express the highly sexualized and deeply gen dered relationship of the twentieth century to its industrial technology and machinery This vision however is not only caught in an anthropomorphic frame which locates the human at the centre of world evolution it also upholds the distinction between the human and the technological if only to redeﬁ ne it as a new alliance This produces a multifaceted inhuman world The modernist era stressed the power of technology not as an isolated event but as a crucial element in the assemblage of industrialization which involved manufactured objects money power social progress imagination and the construc tion of subjectivity As a critical analysis of this historical moment Marxism and its socialist Humanism taught us that objectiﬁ cation is indeed a humiliating and demeaning experi ence for humans in that it denies their full humanity and can thus be truly called inhuman at a basic social level The com modiﬁ cation process itself reduces humans to the status of manufactured and hence proﬁ tdriven technologically medi ated objects This insight constitutes the core of the humanist heart of Marxism which I analysed in chapter 1 Subsuming human relations into the nexus moneypower is for Marx ists a form of inhumanity and the key social injustice of capi talist modes of production This normative stance is all the more striking as Marxism was from the methodological angle an antihumanist theoretical movement that argued against natural essences and debunked the naturalization of differences as a power strategy As we saw in chapter 1 Marxist social constructivism was a deeply antiessentialist methodology resting on a Hegelian philosophy of history which ﬁ rmly believed in technologically driven social prog ress Even Lenin deﬁ ned socialism the motor of historical progress as the soviets local workers councils plus electricity The modernist delirium and its Marxist offshoot did not entirely go up in smoke though many of those railroad tracks The Inhuman Life beyond Death did lead to disaster To return to Marcel LHerbiers ﬁ lm the analogy between the cruelty of the seductress on the one hand and the ruthless energy of the mechanical engine on the other produced a notion of the inhuman as superhuman that posed technology as a transcendent other It also instilled cruelty as a salient element of the narrative of growth and progress already aware that these new technologies cannot but alter the organic human body through new forms of wanted and unwanted intimacy There is consequently another aspect of the inhuman as it is invoked by the modernist canon namely the function and structure of the imagination as expressed in art Modernism located the issue of artistic practice at the core of industrial ized modernity Both the technological object and the artefact are manufactured and hence pertain to the realm of the un natural Their antinaturalistic structure is precisely the common denominator between the machine and the perverse as in nonprocreative sexuality of the femme fatale of art works like LInhumaine and Metropolis Female sexuality is inscribed in this inhuman script as a threat but also as an irresistible attraction technoEves of multiple temptations pointing the way to unsettling futures The inhuman nature of the artistic object consists of a combination of nonfunctionalism and ludic seductiveness This is precisely what the surrealists meant by the bachelor machines  an idea that Deleuze and Guattari adopted and transformed in the theory of bodies without organs or afunctional and unorganic frames of becoming Art not unlike critical philosophy is for Deleuze an intensive practice that aims at creating new ways of thinking perceiving and sensing Lifes inﬁ nite possibilities Deleuze and Guattari 1994 By transposing us beyond the conﬁ nes of bound iden tities art becomes necessarily inhuman in the sense of non human in that it connects to the animal the vegetable earthy and planetary forces that surround us Art is also moreover cosmic in its resonance and hence posthuman by structure as it carries us to the limits of what our embodied selves can do or endure In so far as art stretches the boundaries of representation to the utmost it reaches the limits of life itself and thus confronts the horizon of death To this effect art is linked to death as the experience of limits Blanchot 2000 The Inhuman Life beyond Death I will return to this point later on in the chapter in my discus sion of a posthuman philosophy of death To pursue the point about the inhumanity of technoindus trial culture it should be added at this stage of the argument that scientiﬁ c reason and the rational practices of scientiﬁ c research are not at all alien to both the project of modernism and its inhuman aspects Science shares the mixed legacy of this historical period and is central to the project of indus trialized modernity Mechanical others from impressive industrial machinery to banal household appliances are the coveted objects of collectively funded and socially empow ered scientiﬁ c practices They are yet another expression of that mixture of fear and desire for technology that art and cinema make manifest The inhuman aspects including cruelty and violence are a crucial component of the scientiﬁ c ratio in the modernist era As Paul Rabinow put it 2003 103 The twentieth century witnessed the establishment of a potent and malign connection between knowledge and the military    From the horriﬁ c effects of poison gas and other gifts of the chemical industries through the atom bomb and other gifts of physics and engineering through the Nazi nightmare of racial puriﬁ cation and other gifts of anthropology and the biosciences to the indigestible fact that close to three quar ters of the spending on scientiﬁ c research during the Cold War was devoted to military ends The industries and science of Thanatos have had a glorious century The issue of death and of killing is raised here this time in relation to the aims and structure of science itself Jean Francois Lyotards work The Inhuman 1989 contributes a crucial chapter to this discussion Pursuing the critical stance announced in his classical text The Postmodern Condition 1984 he deﬁ nes the inhuman as the alienating and com modifying effect of advanced capitalism on the human The technological intrusion and manipulation is such as to de humanize this subject in the name of ruthless efﬁ ciency Lyotard does not stop at this technophobic insight but goes on to identify a deeper kind of inhumanity which is speciﬁ c to anthropos himherself That inner core of structural strangeness or productive estrangement is for Lyotard the The Inhuman Life beyond Death nonrational and nonvolitional core of the inhuman which makes us quintessentially human1 It not only conﬁ rms the nonunitary structure of the subject but also functions as the site of ultimate resistance by humanity itself against the de humanizing effects of technologydriven capitalism In this respect for Lyotard the inhuman has a productive ethical and political force which points the way to posthuman ethical relations In this chapter I defend the position that the current his torical context has transformed the modernist inhuman into a posthuman and postanthropocentric set of practices The inhuman is not what it used to be The relationship between the human and the technological other as well as the affects involved in it including desire cruelty and pain change radically with the contemporary technologies of advanced capitalism For one thing the technological con struct now mingles with the ﬂ esh in unprecedented degrees of intrusiveness as we saw in the previous chapter Moreover the nature of the humantechnological interaction has shifted towards a blurring of the boundaries between the genders the races and the species following a trend that Lyotard assesses as a distinctive feature of the contemporary inhuman condition The technological other today  a mere assemblage of circuitry and feedback loops  functions in the realm of an egalitarian blurring of differences if not downright inde terminacy The most eloquent cinematic expression of the neoandrogynous character of advanced capitalism is a ﬁ lm like Avatar 2009 which is as removed from LInhumaine as an iPhone is from an icon There is no doubt as to which is more fashionable today but this is not the point The point is the extraordinary evolution of technology and its unex pected sideeffects From the modernist fantasy of eroticizing the human machine interaction to the postmodernist disenchantment or at least ironical distance from the technological object something fundamental shifted A different political economy of affects came into action a colder sensibility entered our system paving the road to the posthuman Zygmunt Bauman 1 This entity is akin to the Freudian uncanny the Lacanian real and Kristevas abjection 1982 The Inhuman Life beyond Death 1993 1998 was among the ﬁ rst to comment on this cruel colder approach In response to the historical disasters and the pain incurred in the historical era which Eric Hobsbawm called the short twentieth century 1994 and more speciﬁ  cally the Holocaust Bauman stressed the toll that such awful events took upon the moral ﬁ bre and the ethical sensibility of the perpetrators as well as the victims of the violence This results in the brutalization of our moral selves or an increase of moral bestiality among humans Anticolonial and antiracist thinkers like Aimé Césaire and Frantz Fanon also developed this insight into the dissociation of moral sensibil ity that takes place in the soul of the misogynists the racists and the fascists In comparison to this lowering of the ethical standards the victims of violence actually tread the moral high ground This insight lies at the core of the postcolonial nonWestern neohumanism which I analysed in chapter 1 The question now becomes how does the moral crisis of modernity play out in the posthuman frame of reference Does the posthuman condition innovate also on the plane of the inhumane aspects of our planetary interaction Does it introduce dehumanization on a global scale If one considers the scale of the major issues confronting the contemporary world from the ﬁ nancial crises and their consequences for employment and structural economic inequalities to climate change and the ensuing environmental crises not to mention geopolitical conﬂ icts terrorism and humanitarian armed interventions it is clear that the posthuman condition has engendered its own inhumane dimension This chapter deals with the multilayered issue of the inhuman by examining multiple modes of relation to death and dying In an argument about life that constitutes the perfect counterpart of the idea of zoe as a posthuman con tinuum I propose to look more closely at Thanatos and to necropolitics as a way of constructing an afﬁ rmative posthu man theory of death I think that a conceptual shift towards matterrealist vitalism grounded in ontological monism can assist us in this project of rethinking death and mortality in the contemporary biomediated context Politically we need to assess the advantages of the politics of vital afﬁ rmation Ethically we need to relocate compassion and care of both human and nonhuman others in this new frame The Inhuman Life beyond Death We saw in the previous chapter that the posthuman predica ment understood as the biopolitical management of living matter is postanthropocentric in character raising the need for a Lifezoecentred approach Now I want to go a step further and argue that posthuman vital politics shifts the boundaries between life and death and consequently deals not only with the government of the living but also with practices of dying Most of these are linked to inhumane social and political phenomena such as poverty famine and homeless ness which Zillah Eisenstein aptly labelled as global obsceni ties 1998 Vandana Shiva 1997 stresses the extent to which biopower has already turned into a form of bio piracy which calls for very grounded and concrete political analyses Thus the bodies of the empirical subjects who signify difference womannativeearth or natural others have become the disposable bodies of the global economy Contemporary capitalism is indeed biopolitical in that it aims at controlling all that lives as Foucault argues but because Life is not the prerogative of humans only it opens up a zoepolitical or postanthropocentric dimension If anxiety about extinction was common in the nuclear era the posthuman condition of the anthropocene extends the death horizon to most species Yet there is a very important differ ence as Chakrabarty points out A nuclear war would have been a conscious decision on the part of the powers that be Climate change is an unintended consequence of human actions as a species 2009 221 This not only inaugurates a negative or reactive form of panhuman planetary bond which recomposes humanity around a commonly shared bond of vulnerability but also connects the human to the fate of other species as I argued in the previous chapter Death and destruction are the common denominators for this trans versal alliance Let me give you some examples of contemporary ways of dying to illustrate this political economy The posthuman aspects of globalization encompass many phenomena that while not being a priori inhumane still trigger signiﬁ cant destructive aspects The postsecular condition with the rise The Inhuman Life beyond Death of religious extremism in a variety of forms including Chris tian fundamentalism entails a political regression of the rights of women homosexuals and all sexual minorities Sig niﬁ cant signs of this regression are the decline in reproductive rights and the rise of violence against women and GLBT people The effect of global ﬁ nancial networks and un checked hedge funds has been an increase in poverty espe cially among youth and women affected by the disparity in access to the new technologies The status of children is a chapter apart from forced labour to the childsoldier phe nomenon childhood has been violently inserted in infernal cycles of exploitation Bodily politics has shifted with the simultaneous emergence of cyborgs on the one hand and renewed forms of vulnerability on the other Thus next to the proliferation of pandemics like SARS Ebola HIV bird ﬂ u and others more familiar epidemics have also returned notably malaria and tuberculosis so much so that health has become a public policy issue as well as a human rights concern The point is that Lifezoe can be a threatening force as well as a generative one A great deal of health and environ mental concerns as well as geopolitical issues simply blur the distinction between life and death In the era of bio genetic capitalism and natureculture continuum zoe has become an infrahuman force and all the attention is now drawn to the emergency of disappearing nature For instance the public discourse about environmental catastrophes or natural disasters  the Fukushima nuclear plant and the Japanese tsunami the Australian bushﬁ res hurricane Katrina in New Orleans etc  accomplishes a signiﬁ cant double bind it expresses a new ecological awareness while reinsert ing the distinction between nature and culture As Protevi argues 2009 this results in the paradoxical renaturaliza tion of our biotechnologically mediated environment The geopolitical forces are simultaneously renaturalized and subjected to the old hierarchical power relations determined by the dominant politics of the anthropomorphic subject Public discourse has become simultaneously moralistic about the inhuman forces of the environment and quite hypocritical in perpetuating anthropocentric arrogance This position results in the denial of the manmade structure of the catas The Inhuman Life beyond Death collective control like the earth the cosmos or nature Our public morality is simply not up to the challenge of the scale and the complexity of damages engendered by our techno logical advances This gives rise to a double ethical urgency ﬁ rstly how to turn anxiety and the tendency to mourn the loss of the natural order into effective social and political action and secondly how to ground such an action in the responsibility for future generation in the spirit of social sustainability that I have also explored elsewhere Braidotti 2006 Another signiﬁ cant case in point is the posthuman digital universe that I analysed in the previous chapter and which engenders its own inhuman variables They are best mani fested by the proliferation of viruses both computerbased and organic some of which transit from animals to humans and back Illness is clearly not only a prerogative of organic entities but includes a widespread practice of mutual con tamination between organic matter  anthropomorphic or not  and electronic circuitry A rather complex symbiotic relationship has emerged in our cyber universe a sort of mutual dependence between the ﬂ esh and the machine This engenders some signiﬁ cant paradoxes namely that the cor poreal site of subjectivity is simultaneously denied in prac tices of human enhancement and in fantasies of escape via technotranscendence and it is also reenforced as increased vulnerability Balsamo 1996 argues that digital technology promotes dreams of immortality and control over life and death And yet such beliefs about the technological future life of the body are complemented by a palpable fear of death and annihilation from uncontrollable and spectacular bodythreats antibioticresistant viruses random contamina tion ﬂ esheating bacteria Balsamo 1996 12 The inhuman forces of technology have moved into the body intensifying the spectral reminders of the corpsetocome Our social imaginary has taken a forensic turn Popular culture and the infotainment industry are quick to pick up this contradictory trend that reﬂ ects the changing status of the demise of the human body including illness death and extinction The corpse is not only a daily presence in global media and journalistic news but also an object of The Inhuman Life beyond Death entertainment in contemporary popular culture notably in the successful genre of forensic detectives Culture and the arts have been very sensitive in registering the rise in women who kill as shown by the success of recent literary and stage renditions of classics like Hecuba and Medea Not to mention of course the global appeal of sharpshooting Lara Croft in the world of computer games The evolution of gender roles towards a more egalitarian participation by both sexes in the business of killing is one of the most problematic aspects of contemporary gender poli tics They can be summarized as the shift from the universal Human Rights stance of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo to the brutal interventionism of the Chechnya war widows pregnant female suicidebombers and the growing role of women in the military Humanism of humanitarian wars Spiritual death is part of the picture as well if we take into account contemporary embodied social practices that are often pathologized and never addressed fully such as addictions eating disorders and melancholia burnout and states of apathy and disaffection I propose not to simply classify these practices as selfdestructive but rather to see them as normatively neutral manifestations of interaction with and resistance to the political economy of commodiﬁ ca tion of all that lives They exemplify the shifting social rela tions between living and dying in the era of the politics of life itself The currency granted to both legal Ritalin Prozac and illegal drugs in contemporary culture blurs the boundaries between selfdestruction and fashionable behav iour and forces a reconsideration of what is the value of life itself Last but not least assisted suicide and euthanasia practices are challenging the Law to rest on the tacit assump tion of a selfevident value attributed to Life As is often the case advanced capitalism functions by schizoid or inter nally contradictory moves Thus a socially enforced ideology of ﬁ tness health and eternal youth goes hand in hand with increased social disparities in the provision of health care and in mortality rates among infants and youth The obsession with being forever young works in tandem with and forms the counterpart of social practices of euthanasia and assisted death The moment one starts thinking about it multiple ways of dying of inﬂ icting death and suffering losses are proliferating The Inhuman Life beyond Death around us And yet when it comes to accounting for them social theory tends to refer to this political economy as bio political What does life bios have to do with it though Biopolitical analyses since Foucault have transformed the ﬁ eld and introduced more precise understandings of what is involved in the management of the living Why is not the same degree of analytical precision devoted to the analysis of the necropolitical management of dying Both the quantity and the scale of the changes that have taken place in social and personal practices of dying in ways of killing and forms of extinction as well as the creativity of mourning rituals and the necessity of bereavement are such as to support the expansion of the sociocultural agenda This includes the emergence of a new discursive domain Death Studies has become a new and much needed addition to the academic landscape growing out of the 1970s countercul ture into a serious interdisciplinary area that includes moral and religious discussions about mortality but also research in social policy and health issues as well as the very practical aspect of professional training2 I shall return to this expan sion of new studies areas in chapter 4 Beyond Biopolitics Let us start again from the basic insight that the new practices of biopolitical management of life mobilize not only gen erative forces but also new and subtler degrees of death and extinction My argument is that a focus on the vital and self organizing powers of Lifezoe undoes any clearcut distinc tions between living and dying It composes the notion of zoe as a posthuman yet afﬁ rmative lifeforce This vitalist mate rialism rests solidly on a neoSpinozist political ontology of monism and radical immanence engendering a transversal relational ethics to counteract the inhumane aspects of the posthuman predicament 2 See for instance the Centre for Death and Society at the Uni versity of Bath in the UK Several journals also testify to the vitality of this ﬁ eld See among others Death Studies Routledge 1970 redesigned in 1985 Journal of Death and Dying Baywood Pub lishing 1970 and Journal of NearDeath Studies 1978 The Inhuman Life beyond Death I have argued so far that the posthuman predicament in so far as it dislocates the traditional understandings of the human also entails signiﬁ cant changes in the status and struc ture of the inhuman and of inhumane practices The next question then is how do these new formations of the inhuman impact on a theory of the subject and on social and cultural theory Biopolitical analysis is central to this discussion but in the current context it has moved beyond the premises articulated by Foucault in his pioneering efforts I perceive several new trends in thinking about the biopolitical man agement of life and death For instance a school of bio political citizenship has emerged with emphasis on the ethical implications of bio power as an instance of governmentality that is as empowering as it is conﬁ ning Rabinow 2003 Rose 2007 Esposito 2008 This school of thought locates the political moment in the relational and selfregulating accountability of a bioethical subject that takes full respon sibility for hisher genetic existence including illness and other forms of responsibility for ones embodied self As we saw in the previous chapter this position allows for a residual type of Kantianism to emerge around the last phase of Fou caults work with emphasis on individual responsibility for the selfmanagement of ones health and lifestyle The advan tage of this position is that it calls for a higher degree of lucidity about posthuman bioorganic existence which means that the naturalist paradigm is deﬁ nitely abandoned The disadvantage of this position however is that it perverts the notion of responsibility towards individualism in a political context of neoliberal dismantling of the national health service a pillar of the welfare state and increasing privatiza tion Bioethical citizenship indexes access to and responsibil ity for the cost of basic social services like health care to an individuals manifest ability to act responsibly by reducing the risks and exertions linked to the wrong lifestyle In other words here bioethical agency means taking adequate care of ones own genetic capital The recent government cam paigns against smoking excessive drinking and obesity con stitute evidence of this neoliberal normative trend that supports hyperindividualism The neoKantian take on Foucault raises also serious theo retical questions about the notion of biopower Considering The Inhuman Life beyond Death the fast rate of progress and change undergone by contem porary biotechnologies and the challenges they throw to the status of the human Foucaults work has been criticized notably by Haraway 1997 for relying on an outdated vision of contemporary technology Haraway suggests that Fou caults biopower provides the cartography of a world that no longer exists and that we have now entered the age of the informatics of domination Other critical theories come closer to the target notably feminist environmentalist and race theorists who have addressed the shifting status of embodi ment and difference in advanced capitalism in a manner that reﬂ ects the complexity of global social relations3 The central discrepancy between Foucaults notion of bio power and contemporary posthuman structures has to do with the displacement of anthropocentrism In chapter 2 I argued that the biogenetic structure of advanced capitalism reduces bodies to carriers of vital information which get invested with ﬁ nancial value and capitalized They provide the material for new classiﬁ cations of entire populations on the basis of the genetic predispositions and vital capacities for selforganization There is a structural isomorphism between economic and biological growth which makes the power relations of contemporary neoliberal capitalism rawer and cruder than in the Fordist era Cooper 2008 This has important repercussions for the zoe dimension of the politics of dying Because genetic information like psychological traits or neural features is unevenly distributed this system is not only inherently discriminatory but also racist at some basic level of the term Patricia Clough 2008 explores this aspect of the contemporary political economy by analysing the public debates on the availability of pharmaceutical drugs against HIV or largescale vaccines against malaria to mention just a few contemporary examples of posthuman management of Life A whole underclass of genetically overexposed and socially underinsured disposable bodies is engendered both within the Western world and in the emerging global econo mies This kind of population control goes beyond Foucaults 3 See especially Gilroy 2000 Braidotti 2002 Barad 2003 Butler 2004b and Grosz 2004 The Inhuman Life beyond Death analysis of the biopolitical as it does not function by tech niques of discipline and control but rather by biogenetic farming of data and by biopiracy Shiva 1997 As Mark Halsey put it Where once the sole objective was to control the insane the young the feminine the vagrant and the deviant the objective in recent times has been to arrest the nonhuman the inorganic the inert  in short the socalled natural worlds  Halsey 2006 15 This is posthuman zoepolitics not biopolitical governmentality Again monistic posthuman philosophy is of great assis tance to think through these challenging new historical condi tions Reading Deleuze through the lens of Massumi Clough studies the new mechanisms of capture not of liberal indi viduals but biogenetic dividuals statistically reconﬁ gured in populations that surface as pro ﬁ les of bodily capacities indicating what a body can do now and what capacities it might be able to unfold in the future The affective capacity of bodies statistically simulated as risk factors can be apprehended as such without the subject even without the individual subjects body This results in bringing forth competing bureaucratic procedures of control and polit ical command in terms of securing the life of the population 2008 18 This way of linking forms of political control with the estima tion of risk factors is a technique that Foucault deﬁ ned as racism as it conﬁ gures  it engenders as raced  entire populations in a hierarchical scale this time not determined by pigmentation but by other genetic characteristics Because the aim of this political exercise is to estimate a given popula tions chance of survival or of extinction the biopolitical management of the living is not only transversal across species and zoedriven but also inherently linked to death This is the deathbound or necropolitical face of postanthropocen trism and the core of its inhumane character it permits the healthy life of some populations to necessitate the death of others marked as natures degenerate or unhealthy ones Clough 2008 18 The necropolitical dimension also means that the political representation of embodied subjects nowadays can no longer be understood within the visual economy of biopolitics in The Inhuman Life beyond Death Foucaults 1978 sense of the term The representation of embodied subjects is not visual in the sense of being scopic as in the postPlatonic sense of the simulacrum Nor is it specular as in the psychoanalytic mode of redeﬁ ning vision within a dialectical scheme of oppositional recognition of self andas other The representation of embodied subjects has been replaced by simulation and has become schizoid or internally disjointed It is also spectral the body doubles up as the potential corpse it has always been and is represented as a selfreplicating system that is caught in a visual economy of endless circulation Braidotti 2002 The contemporary social imaginary is immersed in this logic of boundless circu lation and thus is suspended somewhere beyond the life and death cycle of the imaged self The biogenetic imagination has consequently become forensic in its relationship to the body as corpse and in the quest for traces of a life that it no longer controls Contemporary embodied subjects have to be accounted for in terms of their surplus value as biogenetic containers on the one hand and as visual commodities cir culating in a global media circuit of cash ﬂ ow on the other Much of this information is not knowledgedriven but rather mediainﬂ ated and thus indistinguishable from sheer enter tainment They are therefore doubly mediated by biogenetic and by informational codes We see then that contemporary biopolitics intersects with the ecophilosophical dimension I analysed in the previous chapter and illuminates the negative face of current socio political power relations The challenge consists in turning these hybrid and slightly schizoid social phenomena into points of resistance to the inhuman aspects of the posthuman condition The central insight of Foucaults political anatomy remains valid biopower also involves the management of dying In other words the question of the governance of life contains that of extinction as well In order to deploy the full ethical and political potential of this brilliant insight however we do need to return to the early Foucault and not be misled by the neoKantian interpretation of his second phase In his earlier work Foucault 1977 focuses explicitly on the critical analysis of the power mechanisms at work in the production of subjectivity The latter is deﬁ ned as a process of both discursive and material circulation of effects The Inhuman Life beyond Death which are productive and not only conﬁ ning This emphasis on power is crucial to make sense of the posthuman predicament Forensic Social Theory Social and political theory after Foucault has been invested by these transformations in the status and the theory of the human as shown for instance in one of the most signiﬁ cant responses to the forensic turn by Giorgio Agamben 1998 He deﬁ nes Lifezoe as the result of the lethal intervention of sovereign power onto the embodied subject who is reduced to bare life that is to say a nonhuman status of extreme vulnerability bordering on extinction Biopower here means Thanatospolitics and it results for Agamben in the indict ment of the project of industrialized modernity in view of its dehumanizing effects The colonial plantation is the proto type of this political economy and the enslaved human almost the epitome of homo sacer Agamben 1998 This insight results in drawing intrinsic links between modernization and violence modernity and terror sovereignty and murder The inhuman for Agamben not unlike Lyotard is the effect of modernization but he also learned from Hannah Arendt 1951 to look at the phenomenon of totalitarianism as the ultimate denial of the humanity of the other Arendt however constructed a powerful alternative to these political extremes by stressing the necessity of human rights for all even and especially the dehumanized others Arendt is in Seyla Benhabibs brilliant formulation a reluctant modern ist 1996 Agamben on the other hand is less innovative and perpetuates the philosophical habit that consists in taking mortality or ﬁ nitude as the transhistorical horizon for dis cussions of life For him bare life is not generative vitality but rather the constitutive vulnerability of the human subject which sovereign power can kill it is that which makes the body into disposable matter in the hands of the despotic force of unchecked power This is linked to Heideggers theory of being as deriving its force from the annihilation of animal life Finitude is introduced as a constitutive element within the framework of subjectivity which also fuels an affective The Inhuman Life beyond Death subject I am perturbed by this ﬁ xation on Thanatos that Nietzsche criticized over a century ago and which is still very present in critical debates today It often produces a gloomy and pes simistic vision not only of power but also of the technological developments that propel the regimes of biopower My understanding of life as zoe ethics of sustainable transforma tions differs considerably from what Agamben calls bare life or negative zoe I beg to differ from the habit that favours the deployment of the problem of zoe on the horizon of death or of liminal state of nonlife This overemphasis on the horizons of mortality and perishability is characteristic of the forensic turn in contemporary social and cultural theory haunted by the spectre of extinction and by the limitations of the project of western modernity I ﬁ nd the overemphasis on death as the basic term of reference inadequate to the vital politics of our era I therefore turn to another signiﬁ cant community of scholars who work within a Spinozist frame work4 and prefer to emphasize the politics of life itself as a relentlessly generative force including and going beyond death This requires an interrogation of the shifting inter relations between human and nonhuman forces Speaking from the position of an embodied and embedded female subject capable of reproducing the future and the species I ﬁ nd the metaphysics of ﬁ nitude to be a myopic way of putting the question of the limits of what we call life We need to rethink death the ultimate subtraction as another phase in a generative process as I will argue in the second half of this chapter Too bad that the relentless generative powers of death require the suppression of that which is the nearest and dearest to me namely myself my own vital beingthere For the narcissistic human subject as psycho analysis teaches us it is unthinkable that Life should go on without my being there Laplanche 1976 The process of confronting the thinkability of a Life that may not have me or any human at the centre is actually a sobering and instruc tive process I see this postanthropocentric shift as the neces 4 This includes Deleuze and Guattari 1977 1987 Guattari 1995 Glissant 1997 Balibar 2002 and Hardt and Negri 2000 The Inhuman Life beyond Death sary start for an ethics of sustainability that aims at redirecting the focus towards the posthuman positivity of zoe At the heart of my research project lies an ethics that respects vulner ability while actively constructing social horizons of hope On Contemporary Necropolitics At this point in the book it is important to stress that afﬁ rma tive politics as the process of transmuting negative passions into productive and sustainable praxis does not deny the reality of horrors violence and destruction It just proposes a different way of dealing with them Contemporary politics has more than its fair share of cruelty to account for New scholarship has concentrated on the brutality of todays wars and the renewed expressions of violence which target not only the government of the living but also multiple practices of dying Biopower and necropolitics are two sides of the same coin as Achille Mbembe 2003 brilliantly argues The explosion of discursive interest in the politics of life itself in other words affects also the geopolitical dimension of death and of killing Mbembe expands Foucaults insight in the direction of a more grounded analysis of the biopolitical management of survival Aptly renaming it necropolitics he deﬁ nes this power essentially as the administration of death the generalized instrumentalization of human exis tence and the material destruction of human bodies and population Mbembe 2003 19 And not only human I might add but also planetary The postCold War world has seen not only a dramatic increase in warfare but also a profound transformation of the practice of war as such New forms of warfare entail simultaneously the breathtaking efﬁ ciency of intelligent unmanned technological weaponry on the one hand and the rawness of dismembered and humiliated human bodies on the other This is exempliﬁ ed by Gaddaﬁ s undigniﬁ ed end which I evoked in the third vignette of the introduction Posthuman wars breed new forms of inhumanity The impli cations of this approach to necropower are radical it is not up to the rationality of the Law and the universalism of moral values to structure the exercise of power but rather the The Inhuman Life beyond Death unleashing of the unrestricted sovereign right to kill maim rape and destroy the life of others This political economy structures the attribution of different degrees of humanity according to hierarchies that are disengaged from the old dialectics and unhinged from biopolitical logic They fulﬁ l instead a more instrumental narrow logic of opportunistic exploitation of the life in you which is generic and not only individual Contemporary necropolitics has taken the politics of death on a global regional scale The new forms of industrial scale warfare rest upon the commercial privatization of the army and the global reach of conﬂ icts which deterritorialize the use of and the rationale for armed service Reduced to infrastructural warfare Mbembe 2003 and to a large scale logistical operation Virilio 2002 war aims at the destruction of all the services that allow civil society to func tion roads electricity lines airports hospitals and other necessities The oldfashioned army has now mutated into urban militias private armies armies of regional lords private security ﬁ rms and state armies all claim the right to exercise violence or to kill Mbembe 2003 32 As a result as a political category the population has also become dis aggregated into rebels child soldiers victims or refugees or civilians incapacitated by mutilation or massacred on the model of ancient sacriﬁ ces while the survivors after a horriﬁ c exodus are conﬁ ned to camps and zones of excep tion Mbembe 2003 34 Many contemporary wars led by Western coalitions under the cover of humanitarian aid are often neocolonial exercises aimed at protecting mineral extraction and other essential geophysical resources needed by the global economy In this respect the new wars look more like privatized conﬂ icts and guerrilla or terrorist attacks than the traditional confrontation of enlisted and nationally indexed armies Arjun Appadurai 1998 has also provided incisive analy ses of the new ethnocidal violence of the new forms of warfare which involve friends kinsmen and neighbours He is appalled by the violence of these conﬂ icts associated with brutality and indignity  involving mutilation cannibalism rape sexual abuse and violence against civilian spaces and populations Put brieﬂ y the focus here is on bodily brutality The Inhuman Life beyond Death perpetrated by ordinary persons against other persons with whom they may have  or could have  previously lived in relative amity Appadurai 1998 907 This is the speciﬁ cally inhuman edge of the posthuman condition Chomsky commented shrewdly on this new situation which he labelled the new military humanism of the human itarian interventions Armed with the technology of global devastation and the jargon of pulp ﬁ ction tabloid headlines and PlayStation games the War on terror the Clash of Civilisations the Axis of Evil Operation Shock and Awe Those adventures set out to save the civilized world homo humanus from its enemies homo barbarus under the venerable banners of liberty decency and democracy Quoted in Davies 1997 134 This deployment of technologically mediated violence cannot be adequately described in terms of disciplining the body ﬁ ghting the enemy or even as the techniques of a society of control We have rather entered the era of orchestrated and instrumental massacres a new semiosis of killing leading to the creation of multiple and parallel deathworlds Mbembe 2003 37 These necropolitical modes of gover nance also circulate as infotainment in global media circuits according to the logic of double mediation I mentioned before The special issue of the weekly magazine The Economist 2 June 2012 p 13 on Morals and the Machine which I mentioned in chapter 1 offers an impressive update on con temporary military technology It argues that recent develop ments are producing an extraordinary new technobestiary For instance the Sand Flea built by Boston Dynamics a spinoff from MIT can leap through a window or onto a roof nine metres high while gyrostabilizers allow smooth ﬁ lming all the way The 5 kg robot then rolls along on wheels until it needs to jump again Then comes RISE a sixlegged robocockroach that can climb walls a TerraMax robotic kit made by Oshkosh Defense Wisconsin that turns military lorries or armoured vehicles into remotely controlled machines LS3 is a doglike robot that uses computer vision so that it trots behind a human over rough terrain carrying The Inhuman Life beyond Death up to 180 kg of supplies SUGV a briefcasesized robot running on caterpillar tracks can identify a man in a crowd upload a mugshot and follow him First Look a military robot Made by iRobot another MIT spinoff is designed to be thrown through windows or over walls Scout XT Throw bot made by Recon Robotics in Minnesota shaped like a twoheaded hammer with wheels on each head has the heft of a grenade and can be thrown through glass windows Wheel spikes provide traction on steep or rocky surfaces An aquatic version is in the making This is indeed the stuff of science ﬁ ction come true As The Economist points out by far the most effective new weapons however are the UGVs unmanned ground vehi cles which started work in Afghanistan a decade ago and the UAVs unmanned aerial vehicles  also known as drones or remotely piloted aircraft RPA  which are part of a large robot army that includes land and sea as well as air In 2005 CIA drones struck targets in Pakistan three times last year there were 76 strikes one of them crucial to killing Gaddaﬁ in Libya Drones come in all sorts of sizes DelFly a drag onﬂ yshaped surveillance drone built at the technical univer sity in Delft weighs less than a gold wedding ring camera included At the other end of the scale comes Americas biggest and fastest drone Avenger at a cost of US15 mn which can carry up to 27 tonnes of bombs sensors and other equipment at more than 740 kmh Do drones make killing too easy Not necessarily answers The Economist They process so much data that they ﬁ ght warfare by committee Government lawyers and others in operating rooms monitor video feeds from robots to call off strikes that are illegal or would look bad on CNN These remote human observers moreover are working in more humane surroundings and are unaffected by combat stress The FireShadow a robotic missile

Guardian Carroll 2012 RPA or drone pilots argue that their jobs involve different types of courage from conventional warfare not only because they have to take the consequences of possible mistakes but also because a different degree of rigour and accuracy is needed to kill by remote control These telethanatological warriors need sophisticated equipment such as multispec tral targeting systems that integrate infrared sensors enhanced TV camera and laser designators and illuminators into single packages Carroll 2012 2 Moreover this complex multi tasking structure of this kind of warfare often takes place under close scrutiny from an array of specialists and supervi sors ofﬁ cers intelligence analysts and military lawyers included Drones do not kill more easily in any sense of the term Critics of these lethal technologies who include former US President Jimmy Carter think otherwise They argue that the drone strikes are extrajudicial executions that violate nations sovereignty stain US moral standing and fuel extremism Carroll 2012 2 They maintain that the best way of dealing with these complex questions is to ban autonomous battle ﬁ eld weapons altogether and require robots to have the full attention of humans all the time In Berlin in 2012 a group of engineers philosophers and activists formed the Interna tional Committee for Robot Arm Control ICRAC in order to try to control the effects of the autonomy reached by con temporary robotic weapon systems and especially drones As the Obama administration pledges investments to the tune of US15 bn for Predator and Reaper drones however there is no denying their growing importance as both offensive weapons and as policy instruments The Economist points out other advantages of posthuman warfare and argues that autonomous robotsoldiers could do more good than harm they would not rape women burn down civilian dwellings in anger or become erratic decision makers under the emotional stress of combat By analogy The Inhuman Life beyond Death driverless cars are likely to be safer than ordinary vehicles just as autopilots have made planes safer Furthermore drones are increasingly being used for civilian purposes not unlike other robots that have long been employed in nuclear plants on the ﬂ ightdeck of passenger aircraft and in driver less trains A recent report by the newspaper The Guardian Franklin 2012 describes how a batteryoperated drone with a range of 300 km and a cost of less than US800 is used by environmental activists to spot and possibly stop Japanese whaling operations in the waters of Antarctica What was once exclusive to Israeli spy forces and the US Air Force is now sent on missions ranging from the survey of marine mammals to crop inspections The Federal Aviation Author ity in the USA has just issued new directives for the use of these vehicles The readers can only marvel at the sophistication of these technological achievements but also wonder about the inhuman risks involved in postanthropocentric weaponry It is also striking to note the role played by academic research in leading universities in the development of these killing robots The timehonoured bond between academia and the military has entered a new highly productive phase in our posthuman world Postanthropocentric technologies are also reshaping the practice of surveillance in the social ﬁ eld Border control of immigration and the smuggling of people are major aspects of the contemporary inhuman condition and central players in the necropolitical game Diken 2004 argues that refugees and asylum seekers become another emblem of the contem porary necropower because they are the perfect instantiation of the disposable humanity that Agamben also calls homo sacer and thus constitute the ultimate necropolitical subject The proliferation of detention and highsecurity camps and prisons within the once civicminded space of European cities is an example of the inhuman face of Fortress Europe The camps  sterilized monofunctional enclosures Diken 2004 91  stand as the undigniﬁ ed monuments of posthuman inhumanity Dufﬁ eld 2008 pushes the necropolitical sociopolitical analysis further and makes a distinction between developed or insured humans and underdeveloped or uninsured The Inhuman Life beyond Death humans Developed life is sustained primarily through regimes of social insurance and bureaucratic protection his torically associated with industrial capitalism and the growth of welfare states Dufﬁ eld 2008 149 The distinction and the tensions between these two categories constitute the terrain for the global civil war which is Dufﬁ elds deﬁ nition of globalized advanced capitalism The link to colonialism is clear decolonization created nationstates whose people once enslaved are now free to circulate globally These people constitute the bulk of the unwanted immigrants refugees and asylum seekers who are contained and locked up across the developed world In a twist not deprived of ironical force world migration is perceived as a particular threat in Europe precisely because it endangers Europes main social infra structure the welfare state The growing range of warfare weapons and killing techniques raises critical questions about the status of death as an object of contemporary political analysis The scale and sophistication of technological mediation in contemporary necropolitics indicates that death as a concept remains caught in a contradiction It is central to political theory and practice in terms of the new killing techniques within a fastexpanding technological context which increases human vulnerability Death is also however underexamined as a term in critical theory and as established practice in sociopolitical governance and international relations Death as a concept remains unitary and undifferentiated while the repertoire of political thought around Life and biopower proliferates and diversiﬁ es Fortunately new posthuman theory is ﬁ lling this vacuum and making important contributions Patrick Hanaﬁ n 2010 for instance suggests that renewed interest in necropolitics coupled with a transversal vision of posthuman subjectivity may help us provide a political and ethical counternarrative to the imposed bounded subject of liberal legalism 2010 133 For Hanaﬁ n this involves a move from the traditional location of mortality as the deﬁ ning quasimetaphysical horizon of being The majoritarian masculine legal social contract is built on the desire to survive This is not a politics of empowerment but one of entrapment in an imagined natural order that in our system translates into a biopolitical The Inhuman Life beyond Death regime of discipline and control of bodies What this means is that we are recognized as full citizens only through the position of victims loss and injury and the forms of repara tion that come with it Posthuman necropolitical political and legal theory raises the question of what political theory might look like if it were not based on the negative instances of wound and loss Hanaﬁ n proposes to take the necropolitical dimension seriously by shifting away from thinking of legal subjectivity as deathbound to thinking about singularities without iden tity who relate intimately to one another and the environment in which they are located This points towards a posthuman critical politics of rights We see here how another fundamen tal binary of Western philosophical thinking gets uncoupled that of a political life qualiﬁ ed by death as opposed to a political and legal philosophy which valorizes our mortal condition and creates a politics of survival This is a post identitarian position that encourages us following Virginia Woolf to adopt a mode of thinking as if already gone that is to say to think with and not against death The emphasis on the deathlife continuum may according to Hanaﬁ n con stitute the ultimate threat to a legal system built on the con ﬁ ning horizon of the metaphysics of mortality William Connollys politics of becoming 1999 argues a similar case against necropolitical destruction we need to develop an ethos of engagement with existing social and political givens  including the horrors of our times  in order to bring about countereffects that is to say unexpected con sequences and transformations Critical theory needs to engage with the present becoming worthy of the times while resisting the violence horror and injustices of the times Braidotti 2008 Afﬁ rmative ethics is based on the praxis of constructing positivity thus propelling new social conditions and relations into being out of injury and pain It actively constructs energy by transforming the negative charge of these experiences even in intimate relationships where the dialectics of domination is at work Benjamin 1988 For Deleuze and Guattari the timeline for this political activity is that of Aion the continuous tense of becoming which is different from working within or against the Chronos of the hegemonic political order We need to actively and collec The Inhuman Life beyond Death tively work towards a refusal of horror and violence  the inhuman aspects of our present  and to turn it into the con struction of afﬁ rmative alternatives Such necropolitical thought aims to bring afﬁ rmation to bear on undoing existing arrangements so as to actualize productive alternatives In the rest of this chapter I will attempt to think the lifedeath continuum within this ongoing engagement with the political accountability of posthuman subjectivity Posthuman Theory on Death One of the obvious preliminary conclusions we can draw from all the above is that we need to think more rigorously about ways of dying in the posthuman context of necro politics on the one hand and the new forensic social sensibil ity on the other How would a vitalist and materialist understanding of death work Death is not a human preroga tive especially in the era of disappearing nature Having reached the antipodes of the rationalist idea of human stew ardship of nature the environmental question is how to prevent species extinction This is a biopolitical issue which species are allowed to survive and which to die And what are the criteria that would allow us to decide Posthuman theory stresses the point that in order to develop adequate criteria we need an alternative vision of subjectivity to support this effort and make it operational We should start by itemizing the different socially distrib uted and organized ways of dying violence diseases poverty accidents wars and catastrophes The persistence of political violence and notions of just wars is part of this conversation as is the analysis of the ways in which critical philosophers have dealt with death Critchley 2008 Then we may proceed by looking at internally produced and selfrun ways of dying suicide burnout depression and other psychosomatic pathologies What does posthuman death theory look like It provides a fuller understanding of how biopolitics actually works in the contemporary context marked by the new wars and by remotecontrolled technothanatological weaponry A necropolitical approach produces a more accurate cartogra phy of how contemporary embodied subjects are interacting The Inhuman Life beyond Death and interkilling In turn this approach offers new analytical tools for an ethics that respects both the horror and the com plexity of our times and attempts to deal with them afﬁ rma tively Quite an agenda which I regret that I cannot do full justice to here Ones view on death depends on ones assumptions about Life In my vitalist materialist view Life is cosmic energy simultaneously empty chaos and absolute speed or move ment It is impersonal and inhuman in the monstrous animal sense of radical alterity zoe in all its powers This does not mean that zoe or life as absolute vitality is not above nega tivity because it can hurt Zoe is always too much for the speciﬁ c slab of enﬂ eshed existence that constitutes single sub jects The human is a step down for pure intensity or the force of the virtual It is a constant challenge for us to rise to the occasion to be worthy of our times while resisting them and thus to practise amor fati afﬁ rmatively It is quite demanding to catch the wave of lifes intensities in a secular manner and ride on it exposing the boundaries or limits as we transgress them No wonder that most of us as George Eliot astutely observed turn our back on that roar of cosmic energy We often crack in the process of facing life and just cannot take it anymore Death is the ultimate transposition though it is not ﬁ nal as zoe carries on relentlessly Death is the inhuman conceptual excess the unrepresent able the unthinkable and the unproductive black hole that we all fear Yet death is also a creative synthesis of ﬂ ows energies and perpetual becoming Gilles Deleuze 1983 1990b 1995 suggests that to make sense of death we need an unconventional approach that rests on a preliminary and fundamental distinction between personal and impersonal death The former is linked to the suppression of the indi vidualized ego The latter is beyond the ego a death that is always ahead of me and marks the extreme threshold of my powers to become In other words in a posthuman perspec tive the emphasis on the impersonality of life is echoed by an analogous reﬂ ection on death Because humans are mortal death or the transience of life is written at our core it is the event that structures our timelines and frames our time zones not as a limit but as a porous threshold In so far as it is everpresent in our psychic and somatic landscapes as The Inhuman Life beyond Death the event that has always already happened Blanchot 2000 death as a constitutive event is behind us it has already taken place as a virtual potential that constructs everything we are The full blast of the awareness of the transitory nature of all that lives is the deﬁ ning moment in our existence It structures our becomingsubjects our capacity and powers of relation and the process of acquiring ethical awareness Being mortal we all are have beens the spectacle of our death is written obliquely into the script of our temporality not as a barrier but as a condition of possibility This means that what we all fear the most our being dead the source of anguish terror and fear does not lie ahead but is already behind us it has been This death that pertains to a past that is forever present is not individual but impersonal it is the precondition of our existence of the future This proximity to death is a close and intimate friendship that calls for endurance in the double sense of temporal duration or continuity and spatial suffering or sustainability Making friends with the impersonal necessity of death is an ethical way of installing oneself in life as a transient slightly wounded visitor We build our house on the crack so to speak We live to recover from the shocking awareness that this game is over even before it started The proximity to death suspends life not into transcendence but rather into the radical immanence of just a life here and now for as long as we can and as much as we can take This does not mean however that Life unfolds on the horizon of death As I argued before this classical notion is central to the metaphysics of ﬁ nitude that especially in the Heideggerian tradition sacralizes death as the deﬁ ning feature of human consciousness I want to stress instead the produc tive differential nature of zoe which means the productive aspect of the lifedeath continuum It does not deny the reality of horrors but rather to rework it so as to assert the vital powers of healing and compassion This is the core of posthuman afﬁ rmative ethics in a contemporary Spinozist mode Braidotti 2011b An illuminating example is pro vided by Edouard Glissant 1997 whose work on colonial ism and literature reframes the horrors of modernity in an afﬁ rmative manner starting from the worldhistorical experience of slavery Glissant applies nomadic thought to The Inhuman Life beyond Death the critique of dominant nationbound mostly Eurocentric mothertongues Calling for hybridized polylingualism and creolization on a global scale is an afﬁ rmative answer to the coercive monoculturalism imposed by the colonial and impe rial powers The ethics of productive afﬁ rmation is a different way of handling the issue of how to deal with pain and traumas and to operate in situations which are extreme while working to bring out the generative force of zoe  life beyond the egobound human In this perspective death is not the teleological destination of life a sort of ontological magnet that propels us forward I repeat that death is behind us Death is the event that has always already taken place at the level of consciousness As an individual occurrence it will come in the form of the physi cal extinction of the body but as event in the sense of the awareness of ﬁ nitude of the interrupted ﬂ ow of my being there death has already taken place We are all synchronized with death  death is the same thing as the time of our living in so far as we all live on borrowed time The time of death as event is the impersonal continuous present of Aion per petual becoming not only the linear and individualized Chronos The temporality of death is time itself by which I mean the totality of time Some of these ideas may seem counterintuitive to the secular critical theorists I want to insist however on the necessity of rethinking posthuman life beyond the old boundaries of death We may do well to remember here the importance of the tactic of defamiliarization which I out lined in the previous chapter To approach death differently we may want to start by introducing some critical distance from the allegedly selfevident value attributed to Life in our culture I live in a world where some people kill in the name of a sacralized Right to life I would like to refer to a more lucid tradition of thought that does not start from the assumption of the inherent selfevident and intrinsic worth of life and stresses instead the traumatic elements of this same life in their often unnoticed familiarity Life in other words is an acquired taste an addiction like any other an openended project One has to work at it Life is passing and we do not own it we just inhabit it not unlike a time share location The Inhuman Life beyond Death Death of a Subject My vitalist notion of death is that it is the inhuman within us which frees us into life Each of us is always already a has been as we are mortal beings Desire as the ontological drive to become potentia seduces us into going on living If sustained long enough life becomes a habit If the habit becomes selffulﬁ lling life becomes addictive which is the opposite of necessary or selfevident Living just a life there fore is a project not a given because there is nothing natural or automatic about it One has to jumpstart into life regu larly by renewing the electromagnetic charge of desire though one often ends up going through the day on automatic pilot Life is at best compelling but it is not compulsive Beyond pleasure and pain life is a process of becoming of stretching the boundaries of endurance Where does this vital notion of death leave critical theory The experiment of defamiliarization consists in trying to think to inﬁ nity against the horror of the void in the wilder ness of nonhuman mental landscapes with the shadow of death dangling in front of our eyes Thought then becomes a gesture of afﬁ rmation and hope for sustainability and endur ance of immanent relations and timebound consistency Moving beyond the paralysing effects of suspicion and pain working across them is the key to ethics Posthuman critical thought does not aim at mastery but at the transformation of negative into positive passions Life is desire which essentially aims at expressing itself and consequently runs on entropic energy it reaches its aim and then dissolves like salmon swimming upstream to procreate and then die The wish to die can consequently be seen as the counterpart and as another expression of the desire to live intensely The corollary is more cheerful not only is there no dialectical tension between Eros and Thanatos but these two entities are really just one lifeforce that aims to reach its own fulﬁ lment Posthuman vital materialism displaces the bound aries between living and dying Life or zoe aims essentially at selfperpetuation and then after it has achieved its aim at dissolution It can be argued therefore that Life as zoe also encompasses what we call death As a result what we The Inhuman Life beyond Death humans most deeply aspire to is not so much to disappear but rather to do so in the space of our own life and in our own way Phillips 1999 It is as if each of us wishes to die in our own fashion Our innermost desire is for a selffash ioned a selfstyled death We thus pursue what we are ulti mately trying to avoid and become virtual existential suicides not from nihilism but because it is our nature to die and our deepest desire to selffashion our own death Of course it is a paradox it is the paradox of the inhuman as analysed by Lyotard something in the structure of the human that simply resists belonging to common humanity and stretches beyond The ontological inhuman has often been rendered as the sacred but for a secular materialist like myself this is not convincing What we do stretch out towards is endless cosmic energy which is as ﬁ erce as it is selforga nizing The awareness of the beyond has to do with death as the experience that has always already happened not as transcendental whathaveyou While at the conscious level all of us struggle for survival at some deeper level of our unconscious structures all we long for is to lie silently and let time wash over us in the stillness of nonlife Selfstyling ones death is an act of afﬁ rmation because it means cultivat ing an approach a style of life that progressively and con tinuously ﬁ xes the modalities and the stage for the ﬁ nal act leaving nothing unattended Pursuing a sort of seduction into immortality the ethical life is life as virtual suicide Life as virtual suicide is life as constant creation Life lived so as to break the cycles of inert repetitions that usher in banality Lest we delude ourselves with narcissistic pretences we need to cultivate endurance immortality within time that is to say death in life It bears repeating that the generative capacity of this life death continuum cannot be bound or conﬁ ned to the single human individual It rather transversally trespasses all bound aries in the pursuit of its aim which is selfperpetuation as the expression of its potency It connects us transindividually transgenerationally and ecophilosophically Just as the life in me is not mine or even individual in the narrow appropria tive sense espoused by liberal individualism so the death in me is not mine except in a very circumscribed sense of the term In both cases all I can hope for is to craft both my The Inhuman Life beyond Death life and my death in a mode at a speed and fashion which can sustain all the intensity I is capable of I can selfstyle this gesture autopoietically thus expressing its essence as the constitutive desire to endure I call it potentia Becomingimperceptible What we humans truly yearn for is to disappear by merging into this generative ﬂ ow of becoming the precondition for which is the loss disappearance and disruption of the atom ized individual self The ideal would be to take only memo ries and to leave behind only footsteps What we most truly desire is to surrender the self preferably in the agony of ecstasy thus choosing our own way of disappearing our way of dying to and as our self This can be described also as the moment of ascetic dissolution of the subject the moment of its merging with the web of nonhuman forces that frame himher the cosmos as a whole We may call it death but in a monistic ontology of vitalist materialism it has rather to do with radical immanence That is to say the grounded total ity of the moment when we coincide completely with our body in becoming at last what we will have been all along a virtual corpse Death the inhuman within marks the becomingimper ceptible of the subject as the furthest frontier of the processes of intensive transformation or becoming This is no transcen dence but radical empirical immanence that is to say a reversal of all that lives into the roar of the chaosmic echoing chamber of becoming It marks the generative force of zoe the great animalmachine of the universe beyond personal individual death Remember that this is a secular discourse generated by a critical theory that wants to think to the end the natureculture continuum within a monistic ontology that considers all matter as intelligent and selforganizing Recognizing this continuum makes us able to be worthy of all that happens to us amor fati being the pragmatic acknowl edgment that the posthuman subject is the expression of successive waves of becoming fuelled by zoe as the ontologi cal motor It is neither human nor divine but relentless material and vowed to multidirectional and crossspecies The Inhuman Life beyond Death relationality Life does go on relentlessly nonhuman in the vital force that animates it Becomingimperceptible marks the point of evacuation or evanescence of the bounded selves and their merger into the milieu the middle grounds the radical immanence of the earth itself and its cosmic reso nance Becomingimperceptible is the event for which there is no representation because it rests on the disappearance of the individuated self Writing as if already gone or thinking beyond the bounded self is the ultimate gesture of de familiarization This process actualizes virtual possibilities in the present in a time sequence that is somewhere between the no longer and the not yet mixing past present and future into the critical mass of an event The vital energy that propels the transmutation of values into afﬁ rmation is the potentia of life as perpetual becoming that expresses itself through the chaotic and generative void of positivity The event enacts a seduction into Life that breaks from the spec tral economy of negativity and involves making friends with impersonal death Posthuman death theory as a vital continuum could not be further removed from the notion of death as the inanimate and indifferent state of matter the entropic state to which the body is supposed to return It rather spells desire as plenitude and overﬂ owing not as lack Death is the becom ingimperceptible of the posthuman subject and as such it is part of the cycles of becoming yet another form of inter connectedness a vital relationship that links one with other multiple forces The impersonal is life and death as bioszoe in us  the ultimate outside as the frontier of the incorporeal becomingimperceptible The paradox of afﬁ rming life as potentia energy even in and through the suppression of the speciﬁ c slice of life that I inhabit is a way of pushing both posthumanism and post anthropocentrism to the point of implosion It dissolves death into evershifting processual changes and thus disintegrates the ego with its capital of narcissism paranoia and negativ ity Death as process from the speciﬁ c and highly restricted viewpoint of the ego is of no signiﬁ cance whatsoever The kind of self that is styled in and through such a process is notOne yet nor is it an anonymous multiplicity The self is differential and constituted through embedded and embodied The Inhuman Life beyond Death sets of interrelations The inner coherence of this posthuman subject is held together by the immanence of hisher expres sions acts and interactions with others and by the powers of remembrance or continuity in time I refer to this process in terms of sustainability so as to stress the idea of endurance which it entails Sustainability does assume faith in a future and also a sense of responsibility for passing on to future generations a world that is liveable and worth living in A present that endures is a sustainable model of the future Against this selfglorifying image of a pretentious and egotis tical narcissistic and paranoid consciousness posthuman critical theory unleashes the multiple dynamic forces of zoe that do not coincide with the human let alone with con sciousness These nonessentialistic brands of vitalism frame the posthuman subject My vitalist brand of materialism could not be further removed from the Christian afﬁ rmation of Life or the tran scendental delegation of the meaning and value system to categories higher than the embodied self Quite the contrary it is the intelligence of radically immanent ﬂ esh that states with every single breath that the life in you is not marked by any master signiﬁ er and it most certainly does not bear your name The awareness of the absolute difference between intensive or incorporeal affects and the speciﬁ c affected bodies that one happens to be is crucial to afﬁ rmative posthu man ethics Death is the unsustainable but it is also virtual in that it has the generative capacity to engender the actual Consequently death is but an obvious manifestation of prin ciples that are active in every aspect of life namely the imper sonal power of potentia The posthuman subject rests on the afﬁ rmation of this kind of multiplicity and the relational con nection with an outside that is cosmic and inﬁ nite Conclusion On Posthuman Ethics The posthuman predicament entails speciﬁ c forms of inhumane practices that call for new frames of analysis and new normative values In this chapter I have addressed the necropolitical aspects on the posthuman condition through several interrelated issues Firstly I discussed the destructive The Inhuman Life beyond Death aspects of the new forms of reactive or negative panhuman ity engendered by shared global risk societies and the general subsumption of all that lives to a political economy of capi talization of the informational capital of Life itself Secondly I focused on the pervasive forms of technological mediation and the extent to which global communication networks and biogenetic intervention have restructured the natureculture relation into a complex continuum that is as destructive as it can be generative Cases in point are the new wars including humanitarian interventions and automated weaponry capable of humanfree decision making I have argued for the need to recast the lifedeath distinction in terms of a vital con tinuum based on internal differentiations I presented it as the double overturning ﬁ rstly of individualism in favour of complex singularities and secondly of anthropocentrism in favour of multiplicities of nonhuman ﬂ ows and assemblages Throughout all these cases I stressed the inhumanity and the violence of our times and called for afﬁ rmative practices to counteract the necropolitical economy we are caught in Let me summarize a number of features of this posthuman necropolitical turn The ﬁ rst point is that the political and legal subject of this regime of lifedeath governmentality is a postanthropocentric ecosophical entity This zoedriven subject is marked by the interdependence with its envi ronment through a structure of mutual ﬂ ows and data transfer that is best conﬁ gured as complex and intensive interconnectedness Secondly this environmentally bound subject is a ﬁ nite collective entity moving beyond the parameters of classical Humanism and anthropocentrism The human organism is an inbetween that is plugged into and connected to a variety of possible The Inhuman Life beyond Death this hightech ecological manner entails full immersion in ﬁ elds of constant ﬂ ows and transformations Not all of them are positive of course because the inhuman aspects entail multiple forms of vulnerability although in such a dynamic system they cannot be known or judged a priori Thus we need to experiment with new practices that allow for a mul tiplicity of possible instances  actualizations and counter actualizations  of the different lines of becoming as I outlined in the previous chapter Thirdly such a subject of zoepower raises questions of ethical and political urgency Given the acceleration of pro cesses of change how can we tell the difference among the different ﬂ ows of changes and transformations Transforma tive lines of ﬂ ight or becoming need to be accounted for and mapped out as a collective assemblage of possible other paths of becoming No monolithic or static model can provide an adequate answer we need more pragmatic openendedness and a diversiﬁ cation of possible strategies The starting point is the relentless generative but also destructive force of zoe and the speciﬁ c brand of transspecies egalitarianism which they establish as the grounds for posthuman ethics It is a matter of forces as well as of ethology Fourthly the speciﬁ c temporality of the posthuman subject needs to be rethought beyond the metaphysics of mortality The subject is an evolutionary engine endowed with her or his own embodied temporality both in the sense of the spe ciﬁ c timing of the genetic code and the more genealogical time of individualized memories If the embodied subject of bio power is a complex molecular organism a biochemical factory of steady and jumping genes an evolutionary entity endowed with its own navigational tools and an inbuilt temporality then we need a form of ethical values and politi cal agency that reﬂ ects this high degree of temporal complex ity My point is that by adopting a different vision of the subject and with it a new notion of the natureculture interac tion critical theory may be able to move beyond modernist and rather reductive conceptions of the inhuman Fifthly and last this ethical approach cannot be dissoci ated from considerations of power The zoecentred vision of the technologically mediated subject of postmodernity or advanced capitalism is fraught with internal contradictions The Inhuman Life beyond Death the subject Braidotti 2002 The zoecentred egalitarianism that is potentially conveyed by the current technological transformations has dire consequences for the humanistic vision of the subject The potency of zoe in other words displaces the exploitative and necropolitical gravitational pull of advanced capitalism Both liberal individualism and classical humanism are disrupted at their very foundations by the social and symbolic transformations induced by our his torical condition Far from being merely a crisis of values this situation confronts us with a formidable set of new opportunities They converge through different paths upon a recomposition of our shared understanding of the human as a species One of these is the negative bond of panhuman vulnerability I analysed in the previous chapter the sense that we are all in this mess together all other differences not withstanding Another approach much closer to my heart is to start from those differences of location and by accounting for them in terms of power as both restrictive and productive potestas and potentia to experiment with different modes of posthuman subjectivity I have argued that as a possible response to this challenge we should consider the posthu manistic brand of postanthropocentric vitalism and have deﬁ ned posthuman theory accordingly This conviction is supported by my historical and geo political location which makes me aware of the schizoid coincidence of diametrically opposed social effects over consumption and depletion of the worlds reserves of biodi versity in seeds grains plants and water supplies seem able to coexist in a political economy of exploitation and celebra tion of Life itself Similarly the epidemic of anorexiabulimia on the one hand and povertyinduced starvation on the other express the spasmodic waves of expansion and shrinking of the bodyweight in the population of the opulent classes of the world and the thinning out and wilful destruction of many other peoples by active intervention or sheer neglect The biopolitical and the necropolitical combine to re locate embodied subjectivity in a posthuman continuum that calls for new ethical coding Thus I also recognize that the The Inhuman Life beyond Death status of embodied humans who become collateral damage in hightech wars that hit them from the sky with intelligent bombs dropped by computerdriven drones is closer to that of the animals at Sarajevo zoo which were forcefully freed as a result of NATO bombing and roamed the streets  ter rorized and terrifying the humans till they succumbed to friendly ﬁ re  than it is to the Geneva Convention deﬁ nition of casualties of war I want to confront the necropolitical governmentality of biogenetic capitalism and think from within the awareness that the market prices of exotic birds and quasiextinct animals are comparable often to the advan taged of the plumed species to that of the disposable bodies of women children and others in the global sex trade and industry Conrads terrifying dictum Exterminate the brutes knows no species boundaries today This is the inhuman face of my location the posthuman here and now in which I situate posthuman critical theory as the active quest for afﬁ r mative alternatives It is also the framework within which I want to propose a creative alternative through secular non essentialist vital materialism and an afﬁ rmative theory of posthuman death as the generative inhuman within the subject which makes us all too human Chapter 4 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory How could the Humanities fail to be affected by the posthu man condition The dislocations of the discursive boundaries and categorical differences triggered respectively by the explo sion of humanism and the implosion of anthropocentrism causes an internal fracture within the Humanities that cannot be mended just by goodwill Let us assess the damage on the basis of the analyses I provided in the three previous chapters In the ﬁ rst chapter I discussed the fallout of posthuman ism The idea of the Human implied in the Humanities that is to say the implicit assumptions about what constitutes the basic unit of reference for the knowing subject is the Vitru vian model It is the image of Man as a rational animal endowed with language Antihumanists over the last thirty years questioned both the selfrepresentation and the image of thought implied in the Humanist deﬁ nition of the Human especially the ideas of transcendental reason and the notion that the subject coincides with rational consciousness This ﬂ attering selfimage of Man is as problematic as it is partial in that it promotes a selfcentred attitude Furthermore by organizing differences on a hierarchical scale of decreasing worth this humanist subject deﬁ ned himself as much by what he excluded from as by what he included in his self representation an approach which often justiﬁ ed a violent Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory and belligerent relationship to the sexualized racialized and naturalized others that occupied the slot of devalued differ ence Furthermore claims to universalism were critiqued as being exclusive androcentric and Eurocentric They support masculinist racist or racial supremacist ideologies that turn cultural speciﬁ city into a fake universal and normality into a normative injunction This image of thought perverts the practice of the Humanities and in particular theory into an exercise of hierarchical exclusion and cultural hegemony Over the last thirty years new critical epistemologies have offered alternative deﬁ nitions of the human by inventing interdisciplinary areas which call themselves studies like gender feminism ethnicity cultural studies postcolonial media and new media and Human rights studies Bart et al 2003 Throughout this book I have foregrounded feminist theory as a major point of theoretical and methodological reference According to James Chandler 2004 this prolifera tion of counterdiscourses creates a condition of critical disci plinarity which is a symptom of the posthuman predicament Chandler argues that since Foucaults pertinent diagnosis of the death of Man the traditional organization of the university in departmental structures has been challenged by the growth of these new discursive areas This proliferation of discourses is both a threat and an opportunity in that it requires method ological innovations such as a critical genealogical approach that bypasses the mere rhetoric of the crisis The fallout of postanthropocentrism which I outlined in chapter 2 sets a different agenda for the Humanities and not only in terms of research priorities The image of thought implied in the postanthropocentric deﬁ nition of the Human goes much further in the deconstruction of the subject because it stresses radical relationality that is to say non unitary identities and multiple allegiances As this shift occurs in a globalized and conﬂ ictridden world it opens up new challenges in terms of both postsecular and postnationalist perspectives including a new European dimension marked by multilingualism and cultural diversity1 What is the place of the Humanities as a scientiﬁ c enterprise in this globalized 1 This aspect of global diversity is also known as vernacular cosmopolitanism Bhabha 1996b Nava 2002 Gunew 2004 Werbner 2006 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory network culture Terranova 2004 that no longer upholds the unity of space and time as its governing principle In the era of citizens science2 and citizens journalism what can be the role of academic research institutions The displacement of anthropocentrism and the scrambling of species hierarchy leaves the Human unmoored and un supported which deprives the ﬁ eld of the Humanities of muchneeded epistemological foundations The question of the future of the Humanities the issue of their renewal and the recurrent threat of death of the disciplines is aggravated by one central factor the new humannonhuman linkages among them complex interfaces involving machinic assem blages of biological wetware and nonbiological hard ware  Bono et al 2008 3 We saw in chapter 2 that the dualistic distinction natureculture has collapsed and is replaced by complex systems of datafeedback interaction and communication transfer This places the issue of the relationship between the two cultures at the centre of the agenda again Against the prophets of doom I want to argue that technologically mediated postanthropocentrism can enlist the resources of biogenetic codes as well as telecom munication new media and information technologies to the task of renewing the Humanities Posthuman subjectivity reshapes the identity of humanistic practices by stressing het eronomy and multifaceted relationality instead of autonomy and selfreferential disciplinary purity The profoundly anthropocentric core of the Humanities is displaced by this complex conﬁ guration of knowledge domi nated by science studies and technological information as I argued in chapters 2 and 3 Far from being a terminal crisis however this challenge opens up new global ecosophical dimensions This posthuman enthusiasm on my part which is not exactly devoid of impatient anticipation stems from my antihumanist and feminist background It produces an energizing but nonetheless critical relationship to the contem porary ﬁ eld of the classical Humanities It would be para doxical to say the least in fact if the critical thinkers who entered the academic institutions in the aftermath of the 1970s cultural revolution with the explicit aim of changing them from within ended up having to simply restore those 2 httpwwwcitizenscienceallianceorg Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory same disciplines and rescue them from institutional decline As I pointed out in the previous chapters things are never clearcut when it comes to developing a consistent posthuman stance and linear thinking may not be the best way to go about it Sam Whimster analyses the dilemma lucidly 2006 174 The Humanities which are a celebration and expressive elu cidation of the human condition as nonreducible to any materialist base have been in retreat since the late 19th century with the emergence of Darwinism as the valid scien tiﬁ c account of the origin of all species of life So a science of the human would seem either to have the capacity to be inhuman or alternatively to be humanistic but hardly scientiﬁ c Whimster also reminds us that French philosophy had addressed the issue of postanthropocentric Humanities and the status of the human in the strikingly original 1748 work by the philosopher Julien La Mettrie 1996 He was a mate rialist humanist in the grand tradition of French enlightened materialism and constitutes a signiﬁ cant early modern prec edent from the ancient archives of the Humanities La Mett ries theory of the inherently mechanical or selforganizing structure of the human is pathbreaking and highly relevant for our own situation Today environmental evolutionary cognitive biogenetic and digital transdisciplinary discursive fronts are emerging around the edges of the classical Humanities and across the disciplines They rest on postanthropocentric premises and technologically mediated emphasis on Life as a zoecentred system of species egalitarianism Braidotti 2006 which are very promising for new research in the ﬁ eld Probably the most signiﬁ cant example of the excellent health enjoyed by the postanthropocentric Humanities is the recent explosion of scholarship in the ﬁ elds of Animal Studies and of Eco criticism The fastchanging ﬁ eld of disability studies is almost emblematic of the posthuman predicament Ever mindful that we do not yet know what a body can do dis ability studies combine the critique of normative bodily models with the advocacy of new creative models of embodi ment Braidotti and Groets 2012 These areas are so rich and fastgrowing that it is impossible to even attempt to sum Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory marize them3 Where do these developments leave the scholar ship in the Humanities Or rather whats the human got to do with this shifting horizon And what are the implications for the future of the Humanities today A contemporary neo vitalist thinker like Elizabeth Grosz pursues this line of research further through a deconstructivist reappraisal of Charles Darwin Grosz 2011 argues that evolutionary theory deﬂ ated humanist pretensions and was a precursor of the crisis of human exceptionalism which has by now become manifest Grosz calls accordingly for the development of inhuman Humanities which consist in speciesequality an emphasis on genetically inscribed sexual difference the primacy of sexual selection and a nonteleological approach to the evolution of the human alongside all other species Although I ﬁ nd Groszs emphasis on the genetic basis of sexual differentiation too rigid for my ﬂ uid nomadic vision of the subject I agree on one important point As a vitalist and selforganizing notion of matter comes to the fore the Humanities need to mutate and become posthuman or to accept sufferings increasing irrelevance As if these postanthropocentric challenges were not enough last but not least comes the fallout of the inhumane aspects of our historical condition which I discussed in chapter 3 According to the tenets of classical Humanism the Humanities were deﬁ ned by their capacity to humanize our social behav iour values and civic interaction This implies an implicit moral mission and concern for the wellbeing of academics students and citizens alike What happens to this claim in an era of posthuman and postanthropocentric shifts of mass migration wars on terror robotized weapons and drones in technologi cally mediated conﬂ icts 3 A companion to Animal Studies has just been published Gross and Vallely 2012 whereas a complete Ecocriticism reader has been available for a while Glotfelty and Fromm 1996 The Journal of Ecocriticism is quite established while a recent issue of the presti gious PMLA papers 2009 was dedicated to the question of the animal For an excellent historical analysis see Joanna Bourke 2011 For the younger generation of scholars Rossini and Tyler 2009 the animal is the posthuman question par excellence The ﬁ eld of disability studies is again too vast to be summarized adequately with an established international Society for Disability Studies which publishes a Quarterly and a complete reader Lenard 1997 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory A clear institutional response to the inhumane structures of our times is the establishment and the proliferation of inter disciplinary areas of study that deal with the disasters of modern and contemporary history Gender feminist and post colonial studies are the prototypes of these new experimental areas which have provided so much in terms of instruments as well as innovative concepts More speciﬁ cally new multidis ciplinary research areas had to be set up to come to terms with the horrors of our times from Holocaust studies to research on slavery and colonialism through to work on the traumatic memories of multiple ideologydriven genocides JF Lyotards idea of the differend 1983  a crime or moral lapse for which there cannot be adequate form of justice let alone of retribu tion or compensation  is relevant to deal with the scale of the catastrophes of our era The differend is the ethical response to the tragedy of the intolerable or the irreconcilable but given that much of this horror is unspeakable how far can the Humanities delve into it Again radical epistemologies such as womens gender queer and feminist studies on the one hand and postcolonial and race studies on the other have played an innovative role in this regard They provide themes and methods to handle the epistemic blast of such horrors and work through their consequence for the role of critical theory They also fulﬁ l a healing function in relation to the legacy of pain and hurt which they entail The proliferation of new discursive ﬁ elds continues after the end of the Cold War when we get the emergence of Centres for Conﬂ ict Studies and Peace Research Humanitarian man agement Human Rightsoriented medicine trauma and recon ciliation studies Death Studies and the list is still growing These are institutional structures that combine pastoral care with a therapeutic function to deal with the inhumane and painful aspects of historical horrors They perpetuate and update the transformative impact of the Humanities in an inhumane context but they do so by exploding the boundaries of classical Humanities disciplines As a result of these multiple domino effects the question of what happens to the Humanities when their implicit assumptions about the Human and the process of humaniza tion can no longer be taken for granted is high on the social and academic agendas Alongside the criticism voiced by posthuman critical thinkers different strands of neo Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory humanism are at work within the contemporary Humanities as we have examined in the previous chapters Taking for instance the case of feminist and race theories as the main point of reference the enduring legacy of Simone de Beau voirs socialist Humanism plays a central role in bringing progressive humanism into the third millennium Other femi nist humanists have also proposed robust alternatives to the crisis of values  such as the neoKantian model of Seyla Benhabib 2002 adapted from Habermas philosophy and her reappraisal of Hannah Arendt 1996 Residual forms of neohumanism already informed by nonWestern assump tions cultural traditions and values come in through post colonial theory as we saw in chapter 1 Hill Collins 1991 Said 2004 Contemporary science studies adopt compensa tory Humanism both to the study of other species de Waal 1996 2006 2009 and to the political analysis of environ mental issues Shiva 1997 The most vocal campaigner for a liberal humanist vision of the contemporary Humanities is Martha Nussbaum who as we saw in chapter 1 ﬁ rmly rejects any critique or decon struction of the ﬁ eld and turns classical humanism into a utopian project still to come 1999 2006 2010 Not for Proﬁ t Nussbaums impassioned defence of the classical Humanities stands out in this context as a noble but also rather unrealistic plea for a status quo ante The vision of the Humanities faculty as a haven of liberal education based on the Kantian notion of the autonomy of rational judgement and the speciﬁ c ethical and aesthetic criteria that go with it is outdated to say the least Moreover because of its privately funded structure it does not even apply to the state education model of the European Union On the practical level it fails to see to what extent faculties of the Humanities are actually proﬁ toriented and make a lot of money for their universities mostly through high student enrolments and intensive teaching Furthermore on the historical front the university ceased to conform to this philosophical vision primarily in the United States but also in the rest of the world in the Cold War period Concerns linked to national security geo political conﬂ icts and international prestige brought the uni versity closer to the military and hence to government control as we saw in chapter 3 After the cultural upheavals of the Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory 1960s the university lost its hegemonic function both as the standard referent for national culture and as the holder of a monopoly over fundamental research which moved to the private sector or to joint enterprises By the time Nussbaum wrote her pamphlet in favour of liberal education the uni versity had already become incorporated into the market economy as an important but by no means unique corporate structure Readings 1996 Therefore instead of turning backwards to a nostalgic vision of the Humanities as the repository and the executors of universal transcendental reason and inherent moral good ness I propose to move forward into multiple posthuman futures We need an active effort to reinvent the academic ﬁ eld of the Humanities in a new global context and to develop an ethical framework worthy of our posthuman times Afﬁ r mation not nostalgia is the road to pursue not the idealiza tion of philosophical metadiscourse but the more pragmatic task of selftransformation through humble experimentation Let me expand on this project in the next section Institutional Patterns of Dissonance The crises of selfdeﬁ nition and public perception of the Humanities have been building up since the end of the 1970s into an institutional debate framed by explicit political factors A recent American study assesses the situation lucidly In addition to the decline of federal funding a shrinking job market and the new pressures of globalization the most sig niﬁ cant internal challenges confronting the Humanities have emerged from the hegemony of techno science the impact of the new media revolution the rise of expert cultures on the one hand and on the other the unprecedented democratic proliferation of new interdisciplinary ﬁ elds such as gender ethnic disability and AfricanAmerican studies as well as studies of nonEuropean cultures all of which put the tradi tional canon and the common mission of the Humanities into question Bono et al 2008 2 The institutional crisis therefore grew beyond issues of self representation to question the dominant paradigm of what constitutes scientiﬁ c knowledge for the contemporary human ists within a university structure that is in ﬂ ux to say the least Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory During the conﬂ ictridden 1990s science wars  also known as theory or culture wars  broke out on the Ameri can campus Arthur and Shapiro 1995 The core of the dispute was precisely the question of differences of paradigm between the Humanities and the natural sciences French Con tinental philosophy and especially poststructuralism were tar geted for particular hostility under the general charge of political correctness Bérubé and Nelson 1995 Militant antipoststructuralist scientists like Socal and Bricmont 1998 accused the Humanities of scientiﬁ c inadequacy and downright ignorance with disastrous effects for the morale of the ﬁ eld They have encouraged the bynow familiar reaction of dis missal of the Humanities through the intellectually lazy charge of moral and cognitive relativism This was deﬁ nitely the lowest point in the contemporary relationship between the two cultures And yet against these vulgar simpliﬁ cations I maintain that it is important to acknowledge the productive contribution that poststructuralism and other critical theories have made to a renewal of the ﬁ eld of the Humanities Foucault argued back in the 1970s that the Humanities as we have come to know them are structured by an implicit set of humanistic assump tions about Man which are historically framed and contextu ally deﬁ ned in spite of their universalistic pretensions As an empiricaltranscendental doublet Man is framed by the struc tures of Life Labour and Language as constant workin progress This is no manifesto for relativism but rather as Rabinow 2003 114 puts it a call for a renewed problema tization of anthropos The changing conditions of our historicity are responsible for the decline of humanist Man To blame poststructuralism for breaking the bad news is to mistake the messenger for the message In Foucaults 1970 ironical terms this death is not a form of extinction but rather a historically speciﬁ c mode of endurance on the part of exMan after the anthropological exodus we examined in chapter 2 With her customary insight and wit Gayatri Spivak 1987 denounced this death as the weakened but nonetheless hegemonic modus vivendi of Euro centric exMan The fact that critical theory has been coming to terms with endless deaths since then ranging from the death Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory of Man to that of the universal of the nation state the end of history and of ideology down to the disappearance of the printed book bears testimony to the sagacity of Spivaks remark What has emerged as a potentially fatal ﬂ aw at the core of the Humanities is their structural anthropomorphism and perennial methodological nationalism Beck 2007 as my hostile colleague from the natural sciences pointed out in the fourth vignette I quoted in the introduction The former trans lates into sustained hostility towards or genuine incompatibil ity with the culture practice and institutional existence of science and technology The latter challenges the Humanities ability to cope with two of the distinctive features of our times ﬁ rstly the scientiﬁ c rise of Life sciences and technologically mediated communication and knowledge transfer and sec ondly the need to take into account cultural diversity notably between different geopolitical areas but also within each one of them This criticism hurts especially in view of the political context The European Union at present is dominated by a rightwing agenda of neoliberal economics on the one hand and xenophobic populist social and cultural agendas on the other As a result the university as an institution and the Humanities especially are under attack They are accused of being unproductive narcissistic and oldfashioned in their approach and also of being out of touch with contemporary science and technology culture The Humanities are therefore experiencing at ﬁ rst hand the crisis of Man that has been theorized by the very radical philosophies like poststructural ism and by feminist and postcolonial interdisciplinary studies which were often marginalized in the university institutional settings The Humanities are often forced into a defensive position The issue of methodological nationalism is crucial in that it is inbuilt into the European Humanities selfrepresentation Edward Said reminded us that Humanism must shed its smug Eurocentrism and become an adventure in difference and alter native cultural traditions This shift of perspectives requires a prior consciousnessraising on the part of Humanities scholars Humanists must recognize with some alarm that the politics of identity and the nationalistically grounded system of educa Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory tion remain at the core of what most of us actually do despite changed boundaries and objects of research Said 2004 55 We shall see later how the changed institutional structure of the contemporary university both rests upon the decline of the nationstate as the horizon for research and has the potential to contribute to a postnational perspective To return to the main point of my current argument I fully endorse the call for an epistemological turn in the Humanities so as to enable them to clarify their own knowledge production processes and consequently become better equipped to help clarify those of others There are however some serious obsta cles to this worthy project The ﬁ rst is the lack of a tradition of epistemological selfreﬂ exivity in the ﬁ eld Linked to this is the deplorable persistence of an introverted culture of disciplin ary insularity unthinking Eurocentrism and anthropocentrism Few of these institutional habits of the Humanities are really conducive to epistemological selfscrutiny The ﬁ eld further more tends to be unable to resist the fatal attraction of the gravitational pull back to Humanism Only a serious mutation can therefore help the Humanities to grow out of some of their entrenched bad habits This requires a number of new perspec tives but over and above these formal criteria I think the Humanities need to ﬁ nd the inspirational courage to move beyond an exclusive concern for the human be it humanistic or anthropocentric Man and to embrace more planetary intel lectual challenges The Humanities in the Twentyﬁ rst Century I have argued in the previous section that the identity crisis of the contemporary Humanities is related to the high levels of technological mediation and the multicultural structure of the globalized world This places the issue of the relationship between the two cultures  the Humanities and the Sciences  at the centre of the debate In a critical evaluation of the contemporary situation Roberts and Mackenzie 2006 argue for a variety of robust and constructive institutional alternatives to the rather unre solved and often conﬂ ictridden relationship between the Humanities and the Sciences in the third millennium One Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory useful strategy aims at identifying points of compatibility between the two cultures and points out the role played by cultural representation images and literary devices  all of them drawn from the subtle a term that I ﬁ nd vastly prefer able to the derogatory soft sciences  in the making of pub licly acclaimed science For instance Gillian Beers 1983 study of evolutionary narratives was positively pathbreaking in this respect and it was brilliantly pursued by studies of literary Darwinism Carroll 2004 Working within scientiﬁ c culture Evelyn Fox Keller 1995 2002 is a pioneer of a different kind producing a series of key texts to illustrate the complementary nature of humanistic knowledge and empirical science The study of Barbara McClintocks life and work Keller 1983 is especially relevant in that it demonstrates the contiguity between cultural insights spiritual resources and experimental science Another angle of approach to the question of the two cul tures today focuses on the function of visualization in science Stephen Jay Gould and Rosamond Purcell 2000 pioneered the dialogue between art and science by a sophisticated inter play of images and scientiﬁ c information This tradition was brought to new heights by the collaborative interdisciplinary work on picturing science and the arts by Carrie Jones and Peter Galison 1998 The ﬁ eld is large and wellendowed with talents that range from the political analysis of the scientiﬁ c gaze Keller 1985 Jordanova 1989 Braidotti 1994 to the cultural history of photography and new media Lury 1998 Zylinska 2009 Crossover studies of the visual arts in rela tion to the physical and biological sciences are also crucial as Barbara Stafford has brilliantly demonstrated 1999 2007 Anthropology has played an inspirational role in the study of science starting from agendasetting pioneers like Marilyn Strathern 1992 to Paul Rabinows Foucauldian take on the Life sciences 2003 and Rayna Rapps combination of politi cal and epistemic elements in the analysis of biotechnologies 2000 Henrietta Moores analyses of subject formations span across the decades of poststructuralism to provide the most consistent insights about the entanglements of bodies psychic landscapes cultures and technologies 1994 2007 2011 Feminist epistemology and social studies of sciences posit feminist theory as the missing link between science studies Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory and epistemological political subjectivity with intellectual pioneers like Donna Haraway 1988 Sandra Harding 1991 1993 Isabelle Stengers 1987 2000 Lisa Cartwright 2001 Mette Bryld and Nina Lykke 1999 and Annemarie Mol 2002 The social studies of science also proved very innova tive as evidenced by the work of Fraser et al 2006 Maureen McNeils shrewd political analyses of technology 2007 and Sarah Franklins pathbreaking work on Dolly the sheep 2007 Cultural studies of science have also been crucial as in Jackie Staceys brilliant analysis of the social and therapeutic cultures of cancer 1997 and of the cinematic life of genetics 2010 The ﬁ eld of media studies has produced an astonishing amount of highquality research on science and technology as testiﬁ ed by the work of Jonathan Crary 2001 and the Zone Books series which brought French theory and philosophy of science to large American audiences Jose van Dijcks analyses of digital culture are pathbreaking 2007 Smelik and Lykke 2008 opened up the ﬁ eld to a variety of original interventions on the interdisciplinary structures of contemporary science and its embedded cultural and social aspects We are confronted therefore by a sort of embarrassment of riches in new discourses about the current relationship between the Sciences and the Humanities and I regret that I cannot pursue a more detailed analysis of the ﬁ elds I have outlined For the moment apart from praising the range and quality of these new areas of scholarship I want to draw several con clusions Firstly that such a wealth of innovative interdisciplin ary scholarship in and across the Humanities is an expression of the vitality of this ﬁ eld not of its crisis Secondly that much of this new research is conducted in those experimental inter disciplinary areas of studies that I have highlighted through out this book as a major source of inspiration Thirdly that they are epistemologically grounded and consequently they enable the contemporary Humanities to clarify their own methods and mechanisms of knowledge production However the very interdisciplinary nature of these new research areas does not facilitate the task of providing a new synthesis of the ﬁ eld This wealth of approaches therefore reopens the old question of the generic identity of the Humanities as a discipline Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory Commenting on this lack of unity in the discursive practice of the Humanities Rabinow remarks 2003 4 No consensus has ever been reached about principles methods and modes of problem speciﬁ cation or    principles of veri ﬁ cation or about forms of narration in the human sciences It is important to stress however that this disunity points to overabundance not lack As a result anthropos is that being who suffers from too many logoi 2003 6 This is especially true in the context of contemporary scientiﬁ c and technological advances which have contributed to even more heterogeneous discourses Their heterogeneity is such that they are incapable of providing an overarching theory of technological self representation They consequently push even further the disag gregation of the discursive unity of anthropos which has proved very creative in adapting to this scientiﬁ c exuberance Perhaps the Humanities have a different relationship to com plexity than the Natural and Life sciences Lorraine Daston 2004 acknowledges the range and quality of these resources and disciplinary precedents She also empha sizes the importance of culture and interpretation to the making of science Daston shows that hermeneutical frameworks are not only embedded in all sorts of disciplines close to the Humanities  notably the social sciences law and the Life sci ences  but are also playing a key role in society at large and are present in all decisionmaking processes Daston therefore encourages humanists to make a bigger effort to explain to the outside world how we know what we know Arguing that the scholarship on epistemology and philosophy of science is slanted in favour of the natural sciences she calls for an epis temology of knowledge practices by humanists This will result in explaining what counts as a scientiﬁ c discovery or just a ﬁ nding for the Humanities with attention to process and praxis as opposed to an exclusive focus on the objects of knowledge Although this is very important and necessary I think that the very nature of data collection in the Humanities clashes with the methods of the natural or Life sciences in that it is based on lived experience and tends towards complexity not quantiﬁ cation In a European context moreover other factors Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory need to be factored in for instance the multilingual structure of research and thinking in the Humanities This means that research practice differs considerably in terms of not only geo graphical but also temporal locations across Europe and beyond Is it then fair to ask this rich and internally differenti ated ﬁ eld to conform to a different research paradigm While the calls for the Humanities to develop some bio literacy and cybernautical skills gather force the resistance remains great both in the Humanities and in the larger sci entiﬁ c community In the meantime the old citation indexes are fast being replaced by Google searches and endless attempts to develop a metric system suited to the research culture of the Humanities is more urgent but also more problematic than ever A new relationship is being estab lished between arts and sciences under our very but the question is whether the Humanities  which have so much to offer  are at all entitled to set the rules of this new institu tional game or whether they are merely asked to conform to rules that were not designed with their best interests in mind The missing links of this dialogue are manifold and they collide over the very deﬁ nition of the posthuman If we postanthropocentric posthumanists not hyphenated and nonunitary subjects are to strike a note of resonance in both scientiﬁ c communities we need to insist on a culture of mutual respect Cultural and social studies of science need to address their resistance to theories of the subject while phi losophies of the subject on the other hand would be advised to confront their mistrust and miscognition of biosciences Posthuman times call for posthuman Humanities studies The issue of the status of theory is implicit in this discussion In response to the current debate on the two cultures Peter Galison 2004 welcomes the end of grand systematic theoreti cal discourse and echoing Lyotards point about the decline of master narratives calls for speciﬁ c theory This means a posi tion between universalistic pretensions of standing outside space and time on the one hand and narrow empiricism on the other Speciﬁ c theory is grounded accountable but also shareable and hence open to generic applications This approach offers both epistemic and ethical advantages which can be immediately put to good use I think for instance that one of the most effective strategies developed by contemporary Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory Humanities scholars is to actually theorize via and with science This methodological and strategic choice is based on the insight of poststructuralism about the parallelism of all discursive and textual practices The textual egalitarianism which was intro duced by the semiotic and linguistic turn of the 1970s  and has shocked and irritated conservative scholars ever since  paved the way for new dialogues and interventions between the subtle and the hard sciences A new science theory has been perfected accordingly4 which I have referred to as the matterrealist trend in chapter 2 The matterrealists combine the legacy of poststructuralist antihumanism with the rejection of the classical opposition materialismidealism to move towards Life as a non essentialist brand of contemporary vitalism and as a complex system I argue that the Humanities must adapt to the chang ing structure of materialism itself notably the fact that it is based on a new concept of matter and is both affective and autopoietic or selforganizing Karen Barads work on agential realism Barad 2003 2007 is an eminent example of this tendency By choosing to bypass the binary between the material and the cultural agential realism focuses on the process of their interaction The focus on materialcultural processes allows us to better interrogate the boundaries between them This results in emphasizing an ethics of knowledge that reﬂ ects and respects complexity and also renews the practice of critical reﬂ exivity Luciana Parisi 2004 also innovates on complexity theory building on Felix Guattaris work She emphasizes that the great advantage of vitalist monism is that it deﬁ nes nature culture as a continuum which evolves through ecology of differentiation The nonsemiotic codes the DNA of all genetic material intersect with complex assemblages of affects embodied practices and other performances that include but are not conﬁ ned to the linguistic realm Parisi strengthens this case by crossreferring to the new epistemol 4 This trend includes thinkers like Ansell Pearson 1997 1999 Massumi 2002 De Landa 2002 Barad 2007 Grosz 2004 Colebrook 2000 2002 Bennett 2001 2010 Clough 2008 Protevi 2009 and Braidotti 1994 2011b Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory ogy of Margulis and Sagan 1995 through the concept of endosymbiosis which like autopoiesis indicates a creative form of evolution This means that the genetic material is exposed to processes of becoming freed from ontological foundations for difference but is not conﬁ ned by social constructivism In matterrealist Humanities research primacy is given to the relation over the terms which foregrounds the transversal connections among material and symbolic concrete and dis cursive entities or forces which include nonhuman Life This is what I call zoe itself Braidotti 2006 and chapters 2 and 3 which allows us to approach science as an object of human istic study and viceversa by transcending both ﬁ elds in a transversal redeﬁ nition of what counts as the subject of posthu man scientiﬁ c practice The theoretical advantage of the matterrealist monistic and vital approach is the ability to account for the ﬂ uid work ings of power in advanced or cognitive capitalism also known as information or network society by grounding them in speciﬁ c locations and immanent relations This allows us to resist them by the same means Posthuman thinkers embrace creatively the challenge of our historicity without giving in to cognitive panic The argument is straightforward if the proper study of mankind used to be Man and the proper study of humanity was the human it seems to follow that the proper study of the posthuman condition is the posthuman itself This new knowing subject is a complex assemblage of human and nonhuman planetary and cosmic given and manufactured which requires major readjustments in our ways of thinking This is not as abstract as it may sound at ﬁ rst Let me give some concrete examples The ﬁ rst is the fastgrowing ﬁ eld of environmental Human ities inspired by the awareness that human activity has a geological inﬂ uence Also known as sustainable Humanities Braidotti 2006 and as anthropocene Humanities5 this interdisciplinary ﬁ eld of study introduces major methodologi cal as well as theoretical innovations For one thing it spells the end of the idea of a denaturalized social order discon 5 I am indebted to Debjani Ganguly and Poul Holm for this felici tous formulation Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory nected from its environmental and organic foundations and calls for more complex schemes of understanding the multi layered form of interdependence we all live in Secondly it stresses the speciﬁ c contribution of the Humanities to the public debate on climate change through the analysis of the social and cultural factors that underscore the public repre sentation of these issues Both the scale and the consequences of climate change are so momentous as to defy representa tion Humanities and more speciﬁ cally cultural research are best suited to ﬁ ll in this deﬁ cit of the social imaginary and help us think the unthinkable The impact of the environmental Humanities is even further reaching In his analysis of the implications of climate change research for the discipline of history Dipesh Chakrab arty 2009 argues for a more conceptual shift towards Deep History This is an interdisciplinary combination of geologi cal and socioeconomic history that focuses both on the plan etary or earth factors and on the cultural changes that have jointly created humanity over hundreds of thousands of years It combines theories of historical subjectivity with species thinking This is in my eyes a postanthropocentric conﬁ gu ration of knowledge that grants the earth the same role and agency as the human subjects that inhabit it As I indicated in chapter 2 this involves changes in our understanding of the temporality of history because we are contemplating the possibility of human and other species extinction and hence the end of recorded historical human time and also the end of the future The collapse of the divide between human and natural histories is a very recent phenomenon and prior to this fundamental shift geological time and the chronology of humans were unrelated at least within the discipline of history In fact historians and climate change research ran parallel discussions without real interdisciplinary exchanges All of this is changing under our very eyes The scale of these mental shifts is such as to almost defy representation as I suggested above Chakrabarty suggests further critical reﬂ ection on the difference between the present historiography of globalization and the historiogra phy demanded by anthropogenic theories of climate change 2009 216 This forces us to bring together categories of thought which were until now kept apart not only by disci Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory plinary boundaries  between the earth sciences and literature and history for instance  but also by the anthropocentric bias that has sustained the Humanities Far from being a crisis this new development has enormous inspirational force for the ﬁ eld It also calls into question some of the current ideas about the negative formation of a new sense of the human as bound together by shared vulnerability in relation to the possibility of extinction Chakrabartys insights about a critical climate changedriven Deep History also challenge some of the given assumptions about postcolonial critiques of the Western universal Quite a programme Another illuminating example of the advantages of a post human scientiﬁ c position is the One Health Initiative which deﬁ nes its mission in terms of Public Health as follows6 Recognizing that human health including mental health via the humananimal bond phenomenon animal health and ecosystem health are inextricably linked One Health seeks to promote improve and defend the health and wellbeing of all species by enhancing cooperation and collaboration between physicians veterinarians other scientiﬁ c health and environmental professionals and by promoting strengths in leadership and management to achieve these goals The movement is inspired by Rudolf Virchow 18211902 who coined the term zoonosis arguing that there should be no dividing lines between animal and human medicine This position has been gathering momentum in the last ﬁ fteen years The One Health Initiative is a rather daring interdisci plinary alliance that unites physicians osteopaths veteri narians dentists nurses and other scientiﬁ chealth and environmentally related disciplines on the basis of a simple hypothesis which is the isomorphism of structures between humans and animals in immunology bacteriology and vaccine developments This means that humans are both exposed and vulnerable to new diseases like bird ﬂ u and other epidemics which they share with animal species Obviously a response to the new pandemics that have emerged in the global era like Bovine 6 httpwwwonehealthinitiativecommissionphp with thanks to my colleague Anton Pijpers Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory spongiform encephalopathy BSE better known as mad cow disease the One Health Initiative stresses the variety of shared diseases that tie humans and animals For instance animals suffer from many of the same chronic diseases such as heart disease cancer diabetes asthma and arthritis as humans It follows therefore that we should develop com parative medicine as the study of disease processes across species and that therefore we should also connect doctors and veterinarians in their daily practices both therapeutic and researchbased Environmentally embedded the One Health Initiative pursues both ecological and social sustainability and has large social repercussions The common concerns about public health among humans and animals is intensiﬁ ed as a result of urbanization global ization climate change wars and terrorism and microbial and chemical pollution of land and water Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory our and other species the semiotic systems of technological apparatus the processes of translation underscoring the Digital Humanities the role of gender and ethnicity as factors that index access to the posthuman predicament and the institutional implications of them all This is a new and inno vative agenda which builds on but is not conﬁ ned to either humanism or anthropocentrism  a genuinely new programme for the Humanities in the twentieth century At the experimental level several new interdisciplinary posthuman studies research platforms have been set up across major universities and are running pathbreaking experi ments as this book goes to press8 As a consequence of this embarrassment of theoretical and research riches the next question that arises is how can the Humanities be inspired by these experiments in posthuman thought and new post anthropocentric research How can they adopt this approach to their own object of study Posthuman Critical Theory The Humanities can be inspired by these new transdisciplin ary models of thought The key to everything for me lies in the methodology and therefore I want to spell out the main criteria for posthuman theory as a way of unfolding the new rules of the game and try to apply them to the Humanities My golden rules are cartography accuracy with the corollary of ethical accountability transdisciplinarity the importance of combining critique with creative ﬁ gurations the principle of nonlinearity the powers of memory and the imagination and the strategy of defamiliarization These methodological guidelines are valuable not only as building blocks for post human critical theory but also because they can help redeﬁ ne 8 See for instance the Posthumanities Hub at the university of Linköping funded by the Swedish government httpwwwtema liusetemagPosthumanNetworklen research conducted at the Institute of Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Bern in Switzerland experiments at the Uni versity of East London in the UK and my work at the Centre for the Humanities at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory the relationship between the Humanities and the Life sciences on the basis of mutual respect Let us begin with cartographic accuracy A cartography is a theoretically based and politically informed reading of the present Cartographies aim at epistemic and ethical account ability by unveiling the power locations which structure our subjectposition As such they account for ones locations in terms of both space geopolitical or ecological dimension and time historical and genealogical dimension This stresses the situated structure of critical theory and it implies the partial or limited nature of all claims to knowledge These qualiﬁ cations are crucial to support the critique of both uni versalism and of liberal individualism Critiques of power locations however are not enough They work in tandem with the quest for alternative ﬁ gura tions or conceptual personae for these locations in terms of power as restrictive potestas but also as empowering or afﬁ rmative potentia For example ﬁ gurations such as the feministthe womanistthe queerthe cyborgthe diasporic native nomadic subjects as well as oncomouse and Dolly the sheep are no mere metaphors but signposts for speciﬁ c geo political and historical locations As such they express complex singularities not universal claims Braidotti 2011a A ﬁ guration is the expression of alternative representations of the subject as a dynamic nonunitary entity it is the dra matization of processes of becoming These processes assume that subject formation takes place inbetween naturetechnol ogy malefemale blackwhite localglobal presentpast  in the spaces that ﬂ ow and connect the binaries These inbetween states defy the established modes of theoretical representation because they are zigzagging not linear and processoriented not conceptdriven Critique and creation strike a new deal in actualizing the practice of conceptual personae or ﬁ gura tion as the active pursuit of afﬁ rmative alternatives to the dominant vision of the subject Zigzagging is indeed the operative word for the next build ing block of posthuman critical theory namely nonlinearity It would be selfdefeating for the Humanities to stick to the traditional rule of visualization by automatically adopting linear thinking considering the complexity of contemporary science and the fact that the global economy does not func Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory tion in a linear manner but is rather weblike scattered and polycentred The heteroglossia of data we are confronted with demands complex topologies of knowledge for a subject structured by multidirectional relationality We consequently need to adopt nonlinearity to develop cartographies of power that account for the paradoxes of the posthuman era This issue gets even more complex in relation to time Linearity is the dominant time of Chronos as opposed to the dynamic and more cyclical time of becoming or Aion as we saw in chapter 2 The former is the keeper of institutional time and practices  Royal science the latter the prerogative of marginal groups  minor science Ofﬁ cial Chronos driven Royal science is opposed to the process of becoming minor of science which is based on a different temporality One is protocolbound the other is curiositydriven and deﬁ nes the scientiﬁ c enterprise in terms of the creation of new concepts Nomadic theory proposes a critique of the powers that dominant linear memorysystems exercise over the Humanities and social sciences Creativity and critique proceed together in the quest for afﬁ rmative alternatives which rest on a nonlinear vision of memory as imagination creation as becoming Instead of deference to the authority of the past we have the ﬂ eeting copresence of multiple time zones in a continuum that activates and deterritorializes stable identities and fractures temporal linearity Deleuze 1988 This dynamic vision of time enlists the creative resources of the imagination to the task of reconnecting to the past Nonlinearity also affects scholarly practice in the Human ities disciplines  a method that replaces linearity with a more rhizomatic style of thinking allows for multiple connections and lines of interaction that necessarily connect the text to its many outsides This method expresses the conviction that the truth of a text is never really written anywhere let alone within the signifying space of the book Nor is it about the authority of a proper noun a signature a tradition a canon or the prestige of an academic discipline The truth of a text requires an altogether different form of account ability and accuracy that resides in the transversal nature of the affects they engender that is to say the outwardbound interconnections or relations they enable and sustain George Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory Eliot pointed the way by writing with ears and mind open to that roar of energy that sustains Life Virginia Woolf did the same by steering her writers gaze towards the perfect stillness of Life deﬁ ned as constant ﬂ ow Writing is a method for transcribing cosmic intensity into sustainable portions of being This has important implications for the task of criticism As poststructuralism taught us Barthes 1975 the method of faithfulness to the text and of citation is more than ﬂ at repetition without difference What comes to the fore instead is the creative capacity that consists in being able to re member and to endure the affective charges of texts as events To do so loyalty is due neither to the spurious depth of the text nor to the authors latent or manifest intentionality and even less to the sovereignty of the phallic Master signiﬁ er A text theoretical and scientiﬁ c as well as literary is a relay point between different moments in space and time as well as different levels degrees forms and conﬁ gurations of the thinking process It is a mobile entity a speedjet Thinking and writing like breathing are not held into the mould of linearity or the conﬁ nes of the printed page but move out wards out of bounds in webs of encounters with ideas others texts The linguistic signiﬁ er is merely one of the points in a chain of effects not its centre or its endgame The source of intellectual inspiration comes from the neverending ﬂ ow of connections between the texts and their multiple outsides Creativity constantly reconnects to the virtual totality of a block of past experiences memories and affects which in a monistic philosophy of becoming get recomposed as action or praxis in the present This approach to critical thinking is an exercise in synchronization which sustains activity here and now by making concrete or actual the virtual intensity This intensity is simultaneously after and before us both past and future in a ﬂ ow or process of muta tion differentiation or becoming It is the matterrealist core of critical thought Nomadic thought encourages an affective openingout towards the geophilosophical or planetary dimension of chaosmosis Guattari 1995 It amounts to turning the thinking subject into the threshold of gratuitous principle of nonproﬁ t aimless principle of mobility or ﬂ ow acts which Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory express the vital energy of transformative becoming principle of nonlinearity Loyalty is instead required to the intensity of the affective forces that compose a text or a concept so as to account for what a text  or a concept or theory  can do what it has done how it has impacted upon ones self and others Accounting for the affective impact of various items or data upon oneself is the process of remembering In Bergson as in Deleuze it has as much to do with the imagina tion that is to say creative reworking as with the passive repetition of chronologically prior recorded and hence retrievable experiences Implicit in this process is the next key criterion for posthu man critical theory which is the role of memory Considering that posthuman time is a complex and nonlinear system internally fractured and multiplied over several time sequences affect and memory become essential elements Freed from chronological linearity and the logocentric gravi tational force memory in the posthuman nomadic mode is the active reinvention of a self that is joyfully discontinuous as opposed to being mournfully consistent Memories need the imagination to empower the actualization of virtual possibilities in the subject which becomes redeﬁ ned as a transversal relational entity inhabited by a vitalist and multi directional memory Rothberg 2009 Memory works in terms of nomadic transpositions that is to say as creative and highly generative interconnections which mix and match mingle and multiply the possibilities of expansion and rela tions among different units or entities Braidotti 2006 The next methodological signpost is the practice of de familiarization which I discussed in chapters 2 and 3 This is a sobering process by which the knowing subject disen gages itself from the dominant normative vision of the self he or she had become accustomed to to evolve towards a post human frame of reference Leaving the Vitruvian frame once and for all the subject becomes relational in a complex manner that connects it to multiple others A subject thus constituted explodes the boundaries of humanism and anthro pocentrism at skin level We have seen in the previous chap ters a series of concrete examples of how disidentiﬁ cations from dominant models of subjectformation can be produc tive and creative drawn from feminist theory  which implies Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory a radical disengagement from the dominant institutions and representations of femininity and masculinity Braidotti 1991 Butler 1991 Postcolonial and race discourse disrupt white privilege and other racialized assumptions about accepted views of what constitutes a human subject9 These disidentiﬁ cations occur along the axes of becoming woman sexualization and becomingother racialization and hence remain within the conﬁ nes of anthropomorphism Yet a more radical shift is needed to break from the latter and develop postanthropocentric forms of identiﬁ cation The unbearable lightness of being falls upon us as soon as we start running with zoe nonhuman life itself Nomadic theorys vital geocentrism  the love of zoe  is a parallel effort in the same direction Becomingearth or becoming imperceptible are more radical breaks with established pat terns of thought naturalization and introduce a radically imminent planetary dimension This anthropological exodus is especially difﬁ cult emotionally as well as methodologically as it can involve a sense of loss and pain Disidentiﬁ cation involves the loss of cherished habits of thought and represen tation a move which can also produce fear sense of insecu rity and nostalgia On the methodological front defamiliarization shifts the relationship to the nonhuman others and requires dis identiﬁ cation from centuryold habits of anthropocentric thought and humanist arrogance which is likely to test the ability and willingness of the Humanities The hard or experimental sciences of course are accomplishing this move away from anthropocentrism with relative ease as we saw in the case of the Deep History or the One Health research movements It may be worth taking seriously the critical charge that the Humanities development towards complexity may be hampered by the anthropocentrism that underscores their practice Will critical theory be able to connect to rich and complex postHumanities to come My working deﬁ nition of a posthuman scientiﬁ c method in the Humanities as well as in the Life sciences cannot be dissociated from an ethics of inquiry that demands respect 9 See Gilroy 2000 Hill Collins 1991 Ware 1992 and Grifﬁ n and Braidotti 2002 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory for the complexities of the reallife world we are living in Posthuman critical theory needs to apply a new vision of subjectivity to both the practice and the public perception of the scientist which is still caught in the classical and out moded model of the humanistic Man of reason Lloyd 1984 as the quintessential European citizen We need to overcome this model and move towards an intensive form of interdisciplinarity transversality and boundarycrossings among a range of discourses This transdisciplinary approach affects the very structure of thought and enacts a rhizomatic embrace of conceptual diversity in scholarship The posthu man method amounts to higher degrees of disciplinary hybridization and relies on intense defamiliarization of our habits of thought through encounters that shatter the ﬂ at repetition of the protocols of institutional reason The Proper Subject of the Humanities is not Man I have argued throughout this book that posthuman theory rests on a process ontology that challenges the traditional equation of subjectivity with rational consciousness resisting the reduction of both to objectivity and linearity10 The nomadic vision of the posthuman knowing subject as a time continuum and a collective assemblage implies a double com mitment on the one hand to processes of change and on the other to a strong ethics of ecosophical sense of community Copresence that is to say the simultaneity of being in the world together deﬁ nes the ethics of interaction with both human and nonhuman others A collectively distributed con sciousness emerges from this a transversal form of non synthetic understanding of the relational bond that connects us This places the relation and the notion of complexity at the centre of both the ethics and the epistemic structures and strategies of the posthuman subject Braidotti 2006 This view has important implications for the production of scientiﬁ c knowledge The dominant vision of the scientiﬁ c 10 For an excellent critical account of the notion of objectivity see Daston and Galison 2007 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory enterprise is based on the institutional implementation of a number of Laws that discipline the practice of scientiﬁ c research and police the thematic and methodological borders of what counts as respectable acceptable and fundable science In so doing the laws of scientiﬁ c practice regulate what a mind is allowed to do and thus they control the structures of our thinking Posthuman thought proposes an alternative vision of both the thinking subject of his or her evolution on the planetary stage and the actual structure of thinking Deleuze and Guattaris idea that the task of thinking is to create new concepts is a great source of inspiration for the Humanities because it rests on the parallelism between philosophy science and the arts This is not to be mistaken for a ﬂ attening out of the differences between these intellec tual pursuits but rather a way of stressing the unity of purpose among the three branches of knowledge Deleuze and Guattari take care to stress the differences between the distinctive styles of intelligence that philosophy science and the arts respectively embody They also argue that they remain indexed on a common plane of intensive selftransforming Life energy This continuum sustains the ontology of becom ing that is the conceptual motor of posthuman nomadic thought In so far as science has to come to terms with the real physical processes of an actualized and deﬁ ned world it is less open to the processes of becoming or differentiation that characterize Deleuzes monistic ontology Philosophy is at an advantage being a subtler tool for the probing intellect one that is more attuned to the virtual plane of immanence to the generative force of a generative universe or chaosmo sis which is nonhuman and in constant ﬂ ux Thinking is the conceptual counterpart of the ability to enter modes of relation to affect and be affected sustaining qualitative shifts and creative tensions accordingly which is also the prerogative of art Critical theory therefore has a major role to play Manuel De Landa 2002 analyses brilliantly the intensive mode of Deleuzian science and stresses the crucial importance of processes of actualization of virtual possibilities over and above universal essence and linear realizations De Landa points out that apart from the antiessentialism intensive Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory nomad science also aims to avoid typological thinking The ruling principle of resemblance identity analogy and opposi tion has to be avoided in thinking about the virtual and intensive becoming Deleuze demands that we give an account of that which allows making such judgements or establishing those relations De Landa 2002 42 The important aspect of nomadic vitalism is that it is neither organicist nor essentialist but pragmatic and imma nent In other words vital materialism does not assume an overarching concept of life just practices and ﬂ ows of becoming complex assemblages and heterogeneous relations As I argued in chapter 2 there is no idealized transcendental but virtual multiplicity The monistic ontology that sustains this vision of life as vitalist selforganizing matter also allows the critical thinker to reunite the different branches of phi losophy the sciences and the arts in a new alliance I see this as a dynamic contemporary formula to redeﬁ ne the relation ship between the two cultures of the subtle Humanities and hard Natural sciences They are different lines of approaching the vital matter that constitutes the core of both subjectivity and its planetary and cosmic relations Bonta and Protevi 2004 stress that Deleuzes geo philosophy encourages the Humanities to engage with con temporary biology and physics in very creative ways The emphasis falls on complexity in distinguishing between actu alized states and virtual becoming  on the basis of a vision of matter as autopoietic The former constitute the object of Royal Science the latter the frame for minor science both are necessary at different points in time but only minor science is ethically transformative and not bound to the economic imperatives of advanced capitalism and its cogni tive excursions into living matter As a consequence one can venture the preliminary conclusion that the main implication of posthuman critical theory for the practice of science is that the scientiﬁ c Laws need to be retuned according to a view of the subject of knowledge as a complex singularity an affec tive assemblage and a relational vitalist entity It follows from all this that the Humanities in the posthu man era of anthropocene should not stick to the Human  let alone Man  as its proper object of study On the contrary the ﬁ eld would beneﬁ t by being free from the Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory empire of humanist Man so as to be able to access in a post anthropocentric manner issues of external and even planetary importance such as scientiﬁ c and technological advances ecological and social sustainability and the multiple chal lenges of globalization Such a change of focus requires assis tance from other social and scientiﬁ c actors as well The question is whether the Humanities are allowed to set their own agenda in relation to contemporary science and technology or whether they are conﬁ ned to places they did not choose to be in the ﬁ rst place There is in fact a distinct tendency for instance in the public debates about climate change or biotechnologies to assign to the institutionally underfunded ﬁ eld of the Humanities all subjects related to the human component of these complex debates This ten dency has made the institutional fortunes of ethics which is expected  and often claims itself the prerogative  to issue new metadiscourses and normative injunctions suited to the dilemmas of our age This metadiscursive claim however is unsubstantiated Moreover it perpetuates the institutional ized habit of thought  reactive and sedentary  of erecting philosophy to the role of a master theory The image of the philosopher as the legislator of knowledge and the judge of truth  a model rooted in the Kantian school  is the exact opposite of what posthuman critical theory is arguing for postidentitarian nonunitary and transversal subjectivity based on relations with human and nonhuman others Another discursive ﬁ eld that gets regularly evoked as the single responsibility of the Humanities is the controversial issue of the social and cultural aspects of complex issues such as climate change or the impact of biotechnologies In other words the Humanities are actively conﬁ ned to the anthropocentric corner while being simultaneously blamed for this limitation which is the perfect illustration of the paradox noted by Whimster 2006 174 a science of the human would seem either to have the capacity to be inhuman or alternatively to be humanistic but hardly scientiﬁ c Damned if you do damned if you dont My point is that the Humanities need to embrace the mul tiple opportunities offered by the posthuman condition The Humanities can set their own objects of enquiry free from the traditional or institutional assignment to the human and Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory its humanistic derivatives We know by now that the ﬁ eld is richly endowed with an archive of multiple possibilities which equip it with the methodological and theoretical resources to set up original and necessary debates with the sciences and technologies and other grand challenges of today The ques tion is what the Humanities can become in the posthuman era and after the decline of the primacy of Man and of anthropos The Global Multiversity The question now is what is the institutional practice best suited to posthuman critical theory and to the twentyﬁ rst century Humanities The discussions about the Humanities ability to cope with the challenges of the third millennium beg the question of the crisis of the university as idea and as representation A brief historical survey of the debate about the idea of the university can give an idea of the extent of this crisis The Renaissance model of the Humanist academy deﬁ ned by the scholar as an artist or artisan handcrafting his or her research patiently and without constraints over a long period of time is simply over It has been replaced by a modern Fordist model of the university as a chainproduction unit mass producing academic good Nussbaums claim 1999 that this model is still carried on today by the American Liberal Arts college is both elitist and nostalgic as I mentioned in chapter 2 Immanuel Kants classical text on The conﬂ icts of the faculties ﬁ rst published in 1789 Kant 1992 presents the blueprint for the modern university based on the model of industrial production Kant divided the university into higher faculties  Law Medicine and Theology  which are practi cally oriented and lower faculties  the Arts Humanities and Sciences  which are responsible for criticism and hence are withdrawn from markets and practical concerns11 This blueprint is still quite valid in spite of several historical modiﬁ cations Probably the most signiﬁ cant is the nineteenth 11 For a contemporary critical update on Kants vision of the uni versity see Lambert 2001 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory century von Humboldt model of the university as the place for training the highly selected and until recently exclusively male elites for leadership and intelligent citizenship That model is still prevalent in Europe In his stimulating and at times devastating anatomy of the contemporary university Bill Readings 1996 argues however that the institution has become posthistorical in that it has outlived itself is now a survivor of the era in which it deﬁ ned itself in terms of the project of the historical development afﬁ rmation and inculcation of national culture 1996 6 All the previous models of the university I men tioned above the Kantian the von Humboldt and even the British colonial defended by Cardinal Newman 1907 have been destabilized by the global economy In this respect the decline of the nationstate has negative consequences for the university as a whole and especially for the Humanities The central ﬁ gure in academic life today is not the professor argues Readings but the administrator and the university is no longer a pillar of national identity or an ideological arm of the nationstate and the state apparatus The university is now no more of a parasitical drain on resources than the stock exchange or the insurance company are a drain on industrial production Like the stock exchange the university is a point of capitals selfknowledge of capitals ability not just to manage risk or diversity but to extract a surplus value from that management In the case of the uni versity this extraction occurs as a result of speculation on differentials in information 1996 40 In this context the muchﬂ aunted notion of excellence means nothing substantial but is a crucial factor in the trans national exchange of academic capital A mere techno bureaucratic ideal Readings 1996 14 it has no content reference This dereferentialization of academic standards has both negative and positive consequences On the negative front the lack of speciﬁ c referents means that excellence is indexed on money markets demands and consumers satisfaction On a more positive note de referentialization opens up the possibility for new spaces in Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory differently 1996 124 What can we do with these models of university today Let us start by looking at the classical conservative model exempliﬁ ed by John Searle in his defence of the key ideas in the Western rationalist tradition 1995 as the core values of Humanities research Firmly grounded in a realist practice of truth the rationalist tradition is textbased and deploys theory in a selfcritical manner It rests on linear thinking because it assumes that the function of language is to com municate effectively Consequently truth is a matter of the accuracy of representation  according to a correspondence theory of truth which grounds statements in observable factual realities It follows that knowledge is expected to be objective  because it relies on representations of an indepen dently existing reality and not on subjectivist interpretations Rationality rules supreme and formal reason  as opposed to practical reason  has its own inner logic which provides standards of proof and validity As a result intellectual stan dards are nonnegotiable and grounded in objective criteria of excellence The traditional idea of the university is supposed to embody and uphold these criteria Searle opposes to this the post modernist university inﬂ uenced by imported antirealist theories of truth which weaken the scientiﬁ city of the aca demic practice The representativeness of the curriculum in terms of gender race and ethnicity  regrettably for Searle  becomes more important than its truth value introducing a shallow intellectual egalitarianism under the guise of mul ticulturalism This causes confusion between a domain to be studied and a cause to be defended which disrupts the deploy ment of traditional Humanities methods and practices and erodes its selfconﬁ dence In an eloquent response to Searle Richard Rorty 1996 criticizes the overemphasis on rationalism as a secularized version of the Western monotheistic tradition 1996 33 Realism and the correspondence to reality are rather mean ingless concepts or rather a term without content 1996 26 The muchpraised objectivity of science argues Rorty rests on active intersubjectivity and social interaction Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory Emphasizing the importance of sociopolitical factors in shaping meanings and truths Rorty strikes a more pragmatic note A healthy and free university accommodates generational change radical religious and political disagreement and new social responsibilities as best it can It muddles through 1996 28 The question of theory and the aftermath of the theory wars comes back to haunt this discussion Searles conservative remarks are accurate as the expression of his emotional involvement in the Humanities selfdefence He is nonethe less ruthless in blaming the postmodern theorists for the situ ation Contrary to the facile antipostmodernism of his approach I would stress the serious methodological chal lenges that this approach has thrown to the Humanities Indeed blaming the postmodern messengers for bringing the sobering message that the humanistic master narratives are in trouble is a sleight of hand that does not help further the cause of the Humanities today It is a great pity that the serious debate about the future of humanistic higher educa tion is caught up in the legacy of the 1990s theory wars and the polemical inﬁ ghting about feminism postmodernism multiculturalism and French philosophy Joan Scott puts it brilliantly As if postmodernists were the cause of all the problems of disciplinary uncertainty scholars are now facing as if their banishment would end the questions about difference posed by demographic changes in university populations by the emergence of postcolonial critiques of colonial assumptions by developments in the history of philosophy that reach back to at least the nineteenth century by the more recent end of the Cold War and by the extraordinary economic constraints of the last years Scott 1996 171 Referring back to John Deweys12 notion of the university as a disciplinary community Scott deplores the politicized 12 Dewey played an important role in launching the American Asso ciation of University Professors in 1915 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory contests about postmodernism and knowledge which over emphasize the presumed political implications of ones scholarly ideas not the ideas themselves Louis Menand 1996 goes further and suggests that conservative political forces are manipulating theory wars as a pretext to interfere in the internal academic affairs of the university as evidence by the particularly targeted attacks against feminism multi culturalism and postcolonialism This critical insight is picked up by Edward Said who connects the identity crisis of the Humanities to the displacement of Eurocentric curri cula in US universities and adds quite ironically Some critics have reacted as if the very nature of the University and academic freedom had been threatened because unduly politicized Others have gone further for them the critique of the Western canon with its panoply of what its opponent have called Dead White European Males    has rather improbably signalled the outset of a new fascism the demise of Western civilization itself and the overturn of slavery child marriage bigamy and the harem Said 1996 21415 Irony left aside it is quite clear that the real target of the conservatives wrath is the threat that these new areas of studies pose to the power of corporate disciplines in two major ways through their radical epistemologies and their methodological interdisciplinarity The meltdown of disci plinary boundaries and the subsequent loss of corporate power by the old disciplines is less of a theoretical than an administrative crisis As Menand astutely observes given that the disciplines are not timeless entities but historically con tingent discursive formations their desegregation is not itself a source of anxiety for the scholars some of whom are even driving the process It is however a major headache for the administrators in charge of the machinery of selfgovernance of Humanities faculties who tend to take advantage of the state of ﬂ ux to reduce spending and increase forceful retrench ments 1996 19 But what does the posthuman have to do with any of this Instead of pursuing this polemic I would rather start from the empirical imperative to think global but act local to develop an institutional frame that actualized a posthuman Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory practice that is worthy of our times Braidotti 2011b while resisting the violence the injustice and the vulgarity of the times Confronting the historicity of our condition means moving the activity of thinking outwards into the real world so as to assume accountability for the conditions that deﬁ ne our location The epistemic and the ethical walk hand in hand into the complicated landscapes of the third millennium We need conceptual creativity and intellectual courage to rise to the occasion as there is no going back Although the issues of pastoral care and intergenerational justice are more topical than ever in the academic classroom it is also the case that since the Cold War era the function of the university has been mostly research and development for the sake of social development and industrial growth and technological advances including but not only the military as we saw in the previous chapter This is especially true of the USA but Europe and vast parts of Asia are also part of this model According to Wernick since the 1960s the uni versity has mutated into a multiversity fulﬁ lling a variety of social and economic functions often linked to the Cold War militarization of the social space and geopolitical con ﬂ icts The term multiversity was coined in 1963 by the then Chancellor of the University of California system Clark Kerr 2001 to refer to the explosion of tasks and demands imposed on major universities The university continued to mutate so that over the next twenty years universities have become corporate oriented to performance and detradition alized Under the aegis of professional managers they have become posthistorical institutions without a memory Wernick 2006 561 As the professoriate and students representative bodies lost their powers of governance to neo liberal economic logic the Humanities dispersed their foun dational value to become a sort of luxury intellectual consumer good Can this trend be reversed What is the most adequate model of the university for the globalized era I want to argue that the posthuman predicament affects also an issue as crucial as the civic responsibility of the university today How can the academic and civic space interact in our globalized technologically mediated world The digital revolution paves the way for at least a partial answer the new campuses will Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory be virtual and hence global by deﬁ nition This means that the universal ideal of transcendent values defended by Searle is over It is being rapidly replaced by the infrastructural vision of the university as a hub of both localized knowledge production and global transmission of cognitive data This need not necessarily result in either dehumanizing or dis embedding the university but in new forms of regrounding and of accountability Thus in an article pointedly called The twenty kilometer university an interdisciplinary team Phillips et al 2011 analyses the changing relationship between the university and the contemporary global city in China and draws some inspiring consequences for the mission of the academic institution today The global city space requires and depends upon intelligent spaces of hightechnological interactivity and can thus be deﬁ ned as a smart city space with dense technological infra structure Ambient technology rests on infrastructural net works which being nonhierarchical and userfriendly defeat the traditional organization of both knowledge production and knowledge transfer In some ways the technologically smart urban space displaces and replaces the university by inscribing knowledge and its circulation at the heart of the social order What happens then to the formerly segregated and at least in Europe highly sacralized academic space The authors argue that the academic needs to unfold onto the civic and become embedded in the urban environment in a radical new manner The city as a whole is the science park of the future The university consequently needs to transform itself into a multiversity Wernick 2006 561 capable of interacting with the city space so as to create a collective ethos of communal intelligence with a common goal of eco nomic progress through the means that sustain and stream line city life Phillips et al 2011 299 The branding of cities and their universities  which was initiated in the Cold War era  enters a new phase of intensifying marketing practices promotional efforts and a ﬁ nancial culture of private and public investments that are often unrelated to the actual content matter The global multiversity is the place where technology and metaphysics meet with explosive but also exhilarating consequences This globalized technologically mediated Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory multiversity is a new entity with its role in relation to citizenformation and bildung fading into the background if not outright obscurity Phillips et al 2011 300 Stefan Collini 2012 13 stresses the same point by arguing that we must stop thinking in terms of nineteenthcentury European ideals and focus instead on how it is the Asian incarnation of the Americanized version of the European model with schools of technology medicine and management to the fore which most powerfully instantiates the ideal of the university in the twentyﬁ rst century In other words the contemporary university needs to rede ﬁ ne its posthuman planetary mission in terms of a renewed relationship to the global city where it is situated This implies both a revision of the urban space and a redeﬁ nition of civic responsibility All the more so as according to the United Nations there will be 22 megacities in the world by 2015 and that by 2050 twothirds of the world population will dwell in urban centres In 2012 we ofﬁ cially registered the fact that 50 per cent of the world population now lives in cities More Internetbacked interactivity will allow citizens to participate in all forms of planning managing and assess ing their urban environment The key words are open source open governance open data and open science granting free access by the public to all scientiﬁ c and administrative data Contemporary twentyﬁ rstcentury cities as in the case of the Chinese study quoted above are not only sprawled out or exploded urban spaces They are also  in the best of cases  technologically mediated smart urban surfaces Just as in the past in Europe universities and their cities grew together weaving a complex web of urban social economic political and civic ties so today a new network of relations is being set up Because of the high degree of technological interven tion involved in contemporary network societies this new urban space can be considered as postanthropocentric and well beyond the Vitruvian frame of reference of a humanist scale Responding to local concerns and global challenges the contemporary multiversity faces up to both the demands of a competitive labour market global culture and the corporate world while pursuing its centuryold missions of scientiﬁ c excellence and enlightened citizenship The cities of tomor row will be living centres of learning information brokering Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory and shared cognitive practice based on intense social net working After naval ports and airports Internet ports will be the gateways to navigating the cities of the third millennium This takes me to the second aspect of the new covenant between the university and the city in the third millennium the civic dimension More than ever the university needs to pursue its aim of ensuring independent research constructive pedagogical practice and critical thinking Compounded by the role that contemporary universities can play as major technological hubs and global centres of knowledge transfer the mix of innovation and tradition can sustain the continu ing relevance of the institution of the university in the con temporary world The combination of technical skills and civic responsibility a concern for social and environmental sustainability and a discerning relationship to consumerism are the core values of the contemporary multiversity Bill Readings 1996 was hinting at this when he referred to the possibility that the contemporary university may help rede ﬁ ne community and belonging away from classical national ism on the one hand and crass consumerism on the other Referring to Blanchots work Readings call for a new model of the university as a community of postidentitarian posthu man subjects The model will be a community without steady identity or ﬁ xed unity for a people and a multiversity to come This has deep implications for the role and place of theory I remember the day when this speciﬁ c penny dropped inside my head I was at a Laurie Anderson concert in Paris in the late 1980s She is one of those conceptual artists who seam lessly unfold into a public intellectual creating acoustic and aesthetic expressions for the transformations of our times O Superman was the ﬁ rst cyber song to become a global hit  a premonition of posthuman things to come  whereas Strange Angels is a critical reappraisal of Walter Benjamins theses on the philosophy of History hinting at a new continuum between the remembrance of things past and the sustainabil ity of the future At this particular concert Anderson who would soon embark on her artist residency with NASA deﬁ ned the work of people who used to call themselves intel lectuals as having become contentproviders That was the Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory late 1980s Last week I received the announcement of a major conference on the future of European education in which an entire panel was devoted to papers by and about ideas brokers That entails marketing and advertising ideas rather than fundamental research and experimentation it does not even particularly require imaginative creativity Academics are left to brokering ideas while information networks do the content provision and are increasingly autonomous in decision making All around an exploded and expanded smart city space distributes the knowledge products to stu dentsusers who are literate in infrastructural knowledge pro duction Welcome to the future That future has already started in the endless reorganiza tions and ﬁ nancial restrictions that plague the contemporary academic world and are particularly acute in the Humanities Louis Menand argues that the modern research university is neither the embodiment of eternal truths and universal ideas nor the paragon of truth beauty and virtue It is actually a rather cumbersome and expensive bureaucracy It is philosophically weak and it encourages intellectual pre dictability professional insularity and social irrelevance It deserves to be replaced But if it is replaced it is in the interests of everyone who values the continued integrity of teaching and inquiry to devise a new institutional structure that will perform the same function Otherwise academic freedom will be killed by the thing that in America kills most swiftly and surely not bad ideas but lack of money Menand 1996 19 This negative social and economic context of ﬁ nancial scarcity has caused a distinct deterioration of the working conditions of all staff in the average neoliberal university worldwide Stefan Collini comments on this issue with cus tomary wit The distracted numbersswamped auditcrazed grantchasing life of most contemporary academics depart ments is far removed from classical ideals of the contempla tive life Collini 2012 19 As a matter of fact academics function more like midranking executives in a business orga nization run by accountants and ﬁ nancial advisors than as independent scholars in a selforganized community The more successful ones have become very skilful in obtaining external grants and funding They are also known as the Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory tenderpreneurs Rosalind Gill 2010 on the other hand not only deplores the working conditions in the academic world but also attempts to assess the damage they cause to both individuals and the institutions where stress and com petitiveness rule The precariousness of younger staff members is a source of special concern Collini concurs the conditions of work of junior and temporary staff in some unfavoured institutions may in limiting cases suggest comparisons with those of staff in a call center 2012 19 Yet it does feel slightly incongruous to think about all this from my speciﬁ c location in the ancient city of Utrecht in the heart of the old world City and university here have become so interwoven over the span of centuries that it is difﬁ cult to tell the urban civic structure apart from the aca demic one Civitas and Universitas are two sides of the same coin and it may not be simple to shift the grounds of their interaction in the name of the posthuman predicament What might the blueprint for the future look like I want to resist the apocalyptic visions of the last professors as a dying species Donoghue 2008 Posthuman Humanities marked by a new alliance between the arts and the sciences and enriched by the ancient European academic and civic tradition can sponsor multiple allegiances and new ecologies of belonging They can redeﬁ ne cosmopolitanism fulﬁ lling the posthuman deﬁ nition of Europe as the place that is historically and morally bound to the critical reelaboration of its own history By extension we need a university that looks like the society it both reﬂ ects and serves that is to say a globalized techno logically mediated ethnically and linguistically diverse society that is still in tune with basic principles of social justice the respect for diversity the principles of hospitality and convivial ity I am aware but do not mind the residual Humanism of such aspirations which I take at best as a productive contradic tion Against the social construction of wilful forgetfulness and of crass ignorance I defend a fundamental aspiration to over arching principles of posthuman bonding A university that is seriously committed to representing todays world needs to tackle these issues by instituting transdisciplinary areas which explore the production of knowledge in a technologi cally mediated world the new relationship between arts and sciences and the polylingual realities engendered by global Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory ization In a new outpour of intellectual creativity posthu man Humanities in the global multiversity will include Humanistic Informatics or digital Humanities Cognitive or neural humanities Environmental or sustainable Humanities Biogenetic and Global Humanities They will also pursue the project of investigating what kind of research methods and insights are developed by literary and art practices They will continue to support the human minds restless pursuit of fuller understanding Collini 2012 27 which is the essential mission of the Humanities In other words I think the Humanities can and will survive and prosper to the extent that they will show the ability and willingness to undergo a major process of transformation in the direction of the posthuman To be worthy of our times we need to be pragmatic we need schemes of thought and ﬁ gurations that enable us to account in empowering terms for the changes and transformations currently on the way We already live in permanent states of transition hybridiza tion and nomadic mobility in emancipated postfeminist multiethnic societies with high degrees of technological inter vention These are neither simple nor linear events but rather multilayered and internally contradictory phenomena They combine elements of ultramodernity with splinters of neoarchaism hightech advances and neoprimitivism which defy the logic of the excluded middle Contemporary culture and institutional education are often unable to represent these realities adequately They favour instead the predictably plaintive refrains about the end of ideologies run concurrently with the apology of the new Nostalgia and hyperconsumerism join hands under the hold of neoliberal restoration of possessive individualism This unitary vision of the humanist subject however cannot provide an effective antidote to the processes of fragmenta tion ﬂ ows and mutations that mark our era We need to start from nonunitary relational subject positions so as to learn to think differently about ourselves and our systems of values starting with adequate cartographies of our embedded and embodied posthuman locations A university that looks like the world of today can only be a multiversity is an exploded and expanded institution that will afﬁ rm a constructive posthumanity As such it cannot Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory labour market but also for its own sake We do need to embrace nonproﬁ t as a key value in contemporary knowledge production but this gratuitousness is linked to the construction of social horizons of hope and therefore it is a vote of conﬁ  dence in the sheer sustainability of the future Braidotti 2006 The future is nothing more or less than intergenerational soli darity responsibility for posterity but it is also our shared dream or a consensual hallucination13 Collini puts it beauti fully 2012 199 we are merely custodians for the present generation of a complex intellectual inheritance which we did not create and which is not ours to destroy Posthuman Humanities are already at work in the global multiversity not only to fend off extinction but also to actualize sustainable posthuman futures 13 This is William Gibsons deﬁ nition of cyberspace Conclusion Not all of us can say with even a modicum of certainty that we have actually become posthuman or that we are only that Some of us insist on feeling quite attached to the human that creature familiar from time immemorial who as a species a planetary presence and a cultural formation spells out speciﬁ c modes of belonging Nor could we explain with any degree of accuracy by which historical contingency intel lectual vicissitudes or twists of fate we have entered the posthuman universe And yet the idea of the posthuman by now enjoys widespread currency in the era known as the anthropocene It elicits elation in equal measure to anxiety and it stimulates controversial cultural representations More importantly for the purposes of this book the posthuman predicament enforces the necessity to think again and to think harder about the status of the human the importance of recasting subjectivity accordingly and the need to invent forms of ethical relations norms and values worthy of the complexity of our times This calls also for the redeﬁ nition of the aims and structures of critical thought and it ultimately comes to bear on the institutional status of the academic ﬁ eld of the Humanities in the contemporary university This book opened with four vignettes that illustrate the excitement as well as the horrors of our times the undoing of the natureculture divide and the high degrees of techno Conclusion logical mediation that create a series of paradoxes such as an electronically linked panhumanity which also breeds intolerance and even xenophobic violence Genetically recom bined plants animals and vegetables proliferate alongside computer and other viruses while unmanned ﬂ ying and ground armed vehicles confront us with new ways of dying Humanity is recreated as a negative category held together by shared vulnerability and the spectre of extinction but also struck down by new and old epidemics in endless new wars detention camps and refugee exodus The appeals for new forms of cosmopolitan relations or a global ethos are often answered by the homicidal acts of the likes of Pekka Eric Auvinen or Anders Behring Breivik1 This book has attempted to analyse in successive waves the alternation of fascination for the posthuman condition and the concern for its inhuman and even inhumane aspects All along I have emphasized the importance of critical theory in the sense of a mix of critique and creativity that makes it imperative for us to come to terms with the present in new fundamental ways My main concerns are how to ﬁ nd ade quate theoretical and imaginary representations for our lived conditions and how to experiment together with alternative forms of posthuman subjectivity The four key questions I set out at the beginning have structured this book as a journey across the multifaceted landscape of the posthuman how can we account for the intellectual and historical itineraries that may have led us to the posthuman Secondly where does the posthuman condition leave humanity and more speciﬁ  cally what new forms of subjectivity does it engender Thirdly how can we stop the posthuman from becoming inhumane And last what is the function of the Humanities and of theory in posthuman times These questions are not linear but intertwined and they trace a zigzagging route across a complex landscape I adopted the speaking stance and the writing position of a tracker and a cartographer in order to account not only for the difﬁ cult transitions but also confessed perpetrator of the 2011 attacks in Oslo and on the island of Utoya killing respectively eight and sixtynine people mostly Socialist youth for some of the contradictions inherent in our current pre dicament Let us see how far we have come at the end of this journey Posthuman Subjectivity The posthuman subject is not postmodern because it does not rely on any antifoundationalist premises Nor is it post structuralist because it does not function within the linguistic turn or other forms of deconstruction Not being framed by the ineluctable powers of signiﬁ cation it is consequently not condemned to seek adequate representation of its existence within a system that is constitutionally incapable of granting due recognition Being based on Lack and Law the linguistic signiﬁ er can at best distribute entrapment and withhold empowerment Its sovereign power builds on the negative passions it solicits making hungry where it most satisﬁ es through envy castration and by encouraging addictive pat terns of consumption of material discursive and cultural goods The posthuman nomadic subject is materialist and vitalist embodied and embedded  it is ﬁ rmly located somewhere according to the radical immanence of the politics of loca tion that I have stressed throughout this book It is a multi faceted and relational subject conceptualized within a monistic ontology through the lenses of Spinoza Deleuze and Guattari plus feminist and postcolonial theories It is a subject actualized by the relational vitality and elemental complexity that mark posthuman thought itself Vital politics breaks clearly from the notion made canoni cal by poststructuralism and psychoanalysis of the primacy of culture and of signiﬁ cation over subject formation There is no originary and fatal capture of an allegedly unmarked subject by the matrix of power be it the Phallus the Logos Eurocentric transcendental reason or heterosexual normativ ity Power is not a steady location operated by a single mas terful owner Monistic politics places differential mechanisms of distribution of power effects at the core of subjectivity Multiple mechanisms of capture also engender multiple forms of resistance Power formations are timebound and conse Conclusion interaction Movement and speed lines of sedimentation and lines of ﬂ ight are the main factors that affect the formation of a nonunitary posthuman subject The nomadic vision of subjectivity is a good starting point but we need to push it further connecting it to two other crucial ideas desire as plenitude and posthuman ethics The idea of desire as plenitude and not as lack produces a more transformative and less negative approach to the nomadic relational subject than previously allowed for instance by the split subject of psychoanalysis The nomadic subject is a branch of complexity theory and it promotes a continuing emphasis on the radical ethics of transformation This is not to deny the role that historical contingency and cultural codes play in subject formation but rather to subject these very factors to a serious update in the light of their own changing structures and compositions As Deleuze and Guattari argue in their critique of psychoanalysis 1977 Jacques Lacans notion of the symbolic is as outdated as a Polaroid shot of a world that has since moved on It captures a frozen frame of family and other intersubjective relations at a time in history when advanced capitalism is investing them with a thoroughly subversive spin The biopolitical nature of this system has grown exponentially since the 1970s affecting radical new forms of intersubjective relationality To state the contrary would be to embrace psychological essentialism and condemn our psychic life to step outside of history and social transformations Our psyche  with its affective fantasy ridden desiredriven complications  would then be forever static in an unhistorical limbo framed by the selfreplicating power of a despotic master signiﬁ er For all vitalist matter realists this mournful vision of a subject desperately attached to the conditions of its own impotence is quite simply an inadequate representation of what we are in the process of becoming We need to be worthy of the present and thus be part of contemporary culture embodying and embedding the subject of this particular world Far from being a ﬂ ight from the real posthuman thought inscribes the contemporary subject in the conditions of its own historicity Life by the same token is neither a metaphysical notion nor a semiotic system of meaning it expresses itself in a multiplicity of empirical acts there is nothing to say but everything to do Life simply by being life expresses itself by actualizing ﬂ ows of energies through codes of vital infor mation across complex somatic cultural and technologically networked systems This is why I defend the idea of amor fati as a way of accepting vital processes and the expressive inten sity of a Life we share with multiple others here and now Posthuman Ethics We are becoming posthuman ethical subjects in our multiple capacities for relations of all sorts and modes of communica tion by codes that transcend the linguistic sign by exceeding it in many directions At this particular point in our collective history we simply do not know what our enﬂ eshed selves minds and bodies as one can actually do We need to ﬁ nd out by embracing an ethics of experiment with intensities The ethical imagination is alive and well in posthuman sub jects in the form of ontological relationality A sustainable ethics for nonunitary subjects rests on an enlarged sense of interconnection between self and others including the non human or earth others by removing the obstacle of self centred individualism on the one hand and the barriers of negativity on the other In other words to be posthuman does not mean to be indifferent to the humans or to be dehumanized On the contrary it rather implies a new way of combining ethical values with the wellbeing of an enlarged sense of community which includes ones territorial or environmental intercon nections This is an ethical bond of an altogether different sort from the selfinterests of an individual subject as deﬁ ned along the canonical lines of classical humanism or from the moral universalism of the Kantians and their reliance on extending human rights to all species virtual entities and cellular compositions Nussbaum 2006 Posthuman theory also bases the ethical relation on positive grounds of joint projects and activities not on the negative or reactive grounds of shared vulnerability This processoriented vision of the subject is capable of a universalistic reach though it rejects moral and cognitive Conclusion universalism It expresses a grounded partial form of account ability based on a strong sense of collectivity and relational ity which results in a renewed claim to community and belonging by singular subjects Lloyd refers to these locally situated microuniversalist claims as a collaborative moral ity Lloyd 1996 74 The stated criteria for this new ethics include nonproﬁ t emphasis on the collective acceptance of relationality and of viral contaminations concerted efforts at experimenting with and actualizing potential or virtual options and a new link between theory and practice includ ing a central role for creativity They are not moral injunc tions but dynamic frames for an ongoing experiment with intensities They need to be enacted collectively so as to produce effective cartographies of how much bodies can take which is why I also call them thresholds of sustainability Braidotti 2006 They aim to create collective bonds a new affective community or polity The key notion in posthuman nomadic ethics is the tran scendence of negativity What this means concretely is that the conditions for renewed political and ethical agency cannot be drawn from the immediate context or the current state of the terrain They have to be generated afﬁ rmatively and cre atively by efforts geared to creating possible futures by mobi lizing resources and visions that have been left untapped and by actualizing them in daily practices of interconnection with others This project requires more visionary power or pro phetic energy qualities which are neither especially in fashion in academic circles nor highly valued scientiﬁ cally in these times of coercive pursuit of globalized excellence Yet the call for more vision is emerging from many quarters in critical theory Feminists have a long and rich genealogy in terms of pleading for increased visionary insight From the very early days Joan Kelly 1979 typiﬁ ed feminist theory as a double edged vision with a strong critical and an equally strong creative function That creative dimension has been central ever since Haraway 1997 2003 Rich 2001 and it consti tutes the afﬁ rmative and innovative core of the radical epis temologies of feminism gender race and postcolonial studies Faith in the creative powers of the imagination is an integral part of feminists appraisal of lived embodied experience and the bodily roots of subjectivity which would express the become Conceptual creativity is simply unimaginable without some visionary fuel Prophetic or visionary minds are thinkers of the future The future as an active object of desire propels us forth and motivates us to be active in the here and now of a continuous present that calls for both resistance and the counteractual ization of alternatives The yearning for sustainable futures can construct a liveable present This is not a leap of faith but an active transposition a transformation at the indepth level Braidotti 2006 A prophetic or visionary dimension is necessary in order to secure an afﬁ rmative hold over the present as the launching pad for sustainable becoming or qualitative transformations of the negativity and the injus tices of the present The future is the virtual unfolding of the afﬁ rmative aspect of the present which honours our obliga tions to the generations to come Afﬁ rmative Politics The pursuit of collective projects aimed at the afﬁ rmation of hope rooted in the ordinary micropractices of everyday life is a strategy to set up sustain and map out sustainable trans formations The motivation for the social construction of hope is grounded in a sense of responsibility and intergener ational accountability A fundamental gratuitousness and a sense of hope is part of it Hope is a way of dreaming up possible futures an anticipatory virtue that permeates our lives and activates them It is a powerful motivating force grounded not only in projects that aim at reconstructing the social imaginary but also in the political economy of desires affects and creativity that underscore it Contemporary practices of posthuman subjectivity work towards a more afﬁ rmative approach to critical theory Beyond unitary visions of the self and teleological renditions of the processes of subject formation posthuman thought can sustain the contemporary subjects in the efforts to synchro nize themselves with the changing world in which they try to make a positive difference For instance against the estab lished tradition of methodological nationalism a different Conclusion image of thought can be activated that rejects Eurouniver salism and trusts instead in the powers of planetary diversity We also need to enlist affectivity memory and the imagina tion to the crucial task of inventing new ﬁ gurations and new ways of representing the complex subjects we have become Science itself is socially inscribed and ecologically integrated not along the nationalistic axis but in a nomadic web of posthuman earthwide connections Becomingposthuman consequently is a process of redeﬁ n ing ones sense of attachment and connection to a shared world a territorial space urban social psychic ecological planetary as it may be It expresses multiple ecologies of belonging while it enacts the transformation of ones senso rial and perceptual coordinates in order to acknowledge the collective nature and outwardbound direction of what we still call the self This is in fact a moveable assemblage within a common lifespace that the subject never masters nor possesses but merely inhabits crosses always in a commu nity a pack a group or a cluster For posthuman theory the subject is a transversal entity fully immersed in and imma nent to a network of nonhuman animal vegetable viral relations The zoecentred embodied subject is shot through with relational linkages of the contaminatingviral kind which interconnect it to a variety of others starting from the envi ronmental or ecoothers and include the technological apparatus This nonessentialist brand of vitalism reduces the hubris of rational consciousness which far from being an act of vertical transcendence is rather recast and pushed down wards in a grounding exercise of radical immanence It is an act of unfolding the self onto the world while enfolding the world within What if consciousness were in fact just another cognitive mode of relating to ones own environment and to others What if by comparison with the immanent know how of animals conscious selfrepresentation were blighted by narcissistic delusions of transcendence and consequently blinded by its own aspirations to selftransparency What if consciousness were ultimately incapable of ﬁ nding a remedy to its obscure disease this life this zoe an impersonal force that moves us without asking for our permission to do so Zoe is an inhuman force that stretches beyond life to new vitalist ways of approaching death as an impersonal event The process ontology centred on life leads the posthuman subject to confront this position lucidly without making con cessions to either moral panic or melancholia It asserts a secular ethical drive to enter into modes of relation that enhance and sustain ones ability to renew and expand the boundaries of what transversal and nonunitary subjects can become The ethical ideal is to actualize the cognitive affec tive and sensorial means to cultivate higher degrees of empow erment and afﬁ rmation of ones interconnections to others in their multiplicity The selection of the affective forces that propel the process of becoming posthuman is regulated by an ethics of joy and afﬁ rmation that functions through the trans formation of negative into positive passions Very much a philosophy of the outside of open spaces and embodied enactments nomadic posthuman thought yearns for a qualitative leap out of the familiar trusting the untapped possibilities opened by our historical location in the techno logically mediated world of today It is a way of being worthy of our times to increase our freedom and understanding of the complexities we inhabit in a world that is neither anthro pocentric nor anthropomorphic but rather geopolitical eco sophical and proudly zoecentred Posthuman all too Human I stated in the introduction that how one feels about the posthuman depends to a great extent on how one relates to the human in the ﬁ rst place I have honestly stated my anti humanist propensities throughout this book my interest in the posthuman is directly proportional to the sense of frustra tion I feel about the human all too human resources and limi tations that frame our collective and personal intensity There is anticipation as well as impatience in what I have been trying to write about in this book Undeniably the vitalist egalitari anism of zoe is likely to attract those who have become dis enchanted with and disengaged from the anthropocentrism that is built into humanistic thought even in what is left of the political Left of feminism and postcolonial theory I live at the tail end of biopower that is to say amidst the relentless necropolitical consumption of all that lives I am committed Conclusion to starting from this not from a nostalgic reinvention of an allinclusive transcendental model a romanticized margin or some holistic ideal I want to think from here and now from Dolly my sister and oncomouse as my totemic divinity from missing seeds and dying species But also simultaneously and without contradiction from the staggering unexpected and relentlessly generative ways in which life as bios and as zoe keeps on ﬁ ghting back This is the kind of materialism that makes me a posthuman thinker at heart and a joyful member of multiple companion species in practice Haraway 2003 I have no nostalgia for that Man alleged measure of all things human or for the forms of knowledge and selfrepresentation he engineered I welcome the multiple horizons that have opened up since the historical downfall of androcentric and Eurocentric Humanism I see the posthuman turn as an amazing opportunity to decide together what and who we are capable of becoming and a unique opportunity for humanity to re invent itself afﬁ rmatively through creativity and empowering ethical relations and not only negatively through vulnerability and fear It is a chance to identify opportunities for resistance and empowerment on a planetary scale I am putting the ﬁ nishing touches to this manuscript just as the 2012 London Olympics are in full swing One of the sensations of these games is the performance by the Jamaican athlete Usain Bolt who ran the mens 100 metre race in 963 seconds at an average speed of 38 kmh the 200 mens metre race in 1932 seconds and with his team mates the 4  100 metre relay race in a breathtaking world record of 3684 seconds The speed is such as to defy our powers of compre hension and it has ignited the imagination of the globally connected world Although this extraordinary runner is expected to improve his personal best record by a couple of seconds more it is generally acknowledged that Usain Bolts superhuman performance has stretched the boundaries of what the human body is capable of achieving at the present point in time Whether this boundary turns out to be an insurmountable physiological limit a collectively selfimposed limitation or rather the threshold of potential exploits by new bodies to come remains to be seen At the same Olympic Games the South African athlete Oscar Pistorius made history as the ﬁ rst double amputee to compete Although the struggle to qualify was long and con troversial and the athlete did not win any medals in the end Pistorius was the ﬁ rst enhanced human to run on carbon ﬁ bre transtibial artiﬁ cial limbs2 and hold his ground valiantly against natural born fastidious bipeds The extent to which Pistorius otherwise human performance sets the tone for posthuman things to come is now an open question Whether the precedent he set has a future and what kind of scenarios it might enable remain to be seen Faced with transformations of this magnitude it is urgent to set a new posthuman social agenda The limits and limita tions of posthuman bodies must become the object of collec tive discussions and decisions across the multiple constituencies of our polity and civil society in a manner that does not assume the centrality let alone the universality of humanistic principles and anthropocentric assumptions We now need to learn to think differently about ourselves and to experiment with new fundamental schemes of thought about what counts as the new basic unit of common reference for the human This is why I insisted so much in this book on issues of sub jectivity we need new frameworks for the identiﬁ cation of common points of reference and values in order to come to terms with the staggering transformations we are witnessing This book rests on the ﬁ rm belief that we early third millen nium posthuman subjects in our multiple and differential locations are perfectly capable of rising to the challenge of our times provided we make it into a collective endeavour and joint project Concrete actualized praxis is the best way to deal with the virtual possibilities that are opening up under our very eyes as a result of our collectively sustained social and scientiﬁ c advances Human embodiment and subjectivity are currently under going a profound mutation Like all people living in an age of transition we are not always lucid or clear about where we are going or even capable of explaining what exactly is happening to and around us Some of these events strike us in awe and fear while others startle us with delight It is as if our current context kept on throwing open the doors of our collective perception forcing us to hear the roar of cosmic energy that lies on the other side of silence and to stretch the 2 They are Cheetah FlexFoot devices by the ﬁ rm Ossur Conclusion measure of what has become possible It is both exciting and unsettling to be reminded almost on a daily basis that we are after all such stuff as dreams are made of and that the new possibilities are immense No wonder so many of us turn their backs on this preferring to go about well wadded with stupidity as George Eliot prophetically put it And yet Dolly the sheep is real not a science ﬁ ction char acter but the result of our scientiﬁ c research an active social imaginary and major ﬁ nancial investments Although he is popularly known as Blade Runner Oscar Pistorius does not dream of electric sheep Conductorfree trains connecting global transportation hubs to major metropolitan centres are by now a familiar sight and our handheld electronic devices so powerful that we can barely keep up with them Human all too posthuman these extensions and enhancements of what bodies can do are here to stay Are we going to be able to catch up with our posthuman selves or shall we continue to linger in a theoretical and imaginative state of jetlag in relation to our lived environment This is not Huxleys Brave New World that is to say a dystopian rendition of the worst modernist nightmares Nor is it a transhumanist delirium of transcendence from the corporeal frame of the contemporary human This is a new situation we ﬁ nd ourselves in the immanent here and now of a posthuman planet It is one of the possible worlds we have made for ourselves and in so far as it is the result of our joint efforts and collective imaginings it is quite simply the best of all possible posthuman worlds Bhabha Homi K 1994 The Location of Culture London and New York Routledge Bhabha Homi K 1996a Unpacking my library    again In Iain Chambers and Lidia
