Chapter 3 Posthuman Sexuality From Ahumanity to Cosmogenic Desire lenge conﬁgurations of life However there are ways in which an ethics of posthu man sexuality coming from a feminist history can be both accountable and avoid the perils of superﬁcial posthumanism via certain instances of desire This chapter will explore the trajectory of posthuman desire implemented through Continental Philosophy and end with a variety of conﬁgurations of desire beyond humanism but also beyond the phallologically driven biotech fetishism of some posthuman ism The posthuman shows we can no longer be trustworthy of studies of the human of humanism or even of the dispelling of the myth we were ever human Posthuman sexuality in its primary repudiation of the objectsubject sexual dialo gue reconstitutes desire not as between two or subject and thing but as affective and thus ethical force desire is constituted before the crystallization of the body and the organs before the division of the sexes before the separation between the familiarized self and the social ﬁeld Guattari 1996 153 Similar to Guattaris claim that desire belongs to the before and beyond of the subject Kristevas semio tic emphasises the before and the beyond the symbolic which is where feminist desire is found but never revealed Kristeva argues that asigniﬁed drive and thus asignifying image is not infantile prehuman but schizoid posthuman destructuring and asignifying machine of the unconscious  schizophrenic ﬂow  not schizophrenic blockage is a structuring and destructuring practice a passage to the outer boundaries of the subject and society Then  and only then  can P MacCormack  email patriciamaccormackangliaacuk  Springer International Publishing AG 2018 C Åsberg R Braidotti eds A Feminist Companion to the Posthumanities httpsdoiorg1010079783319621401_3 it be jouissance and revolution 1984 17 The posthuman in its rupturing of causal and chronocentric evolution including desire as evolutionarily more reﬁned is outside of time into a place of encounter with the imperceptible but materially affective outside Perhaps also this is why my position as a feminist of posthuman sexualities will be guilty of what Cary Wolfe states of That paradoxical observa bility of the unobservable the communicability of the incommunicable  which ought to sound familiar to students of romanticism 2009 xxxii Seemingly Foucault is similarly romantic A manifest truth writes Foucault disappearing not when it is replaced by another one that is fresher or sharper but when one begins to detect the very conditions that made it seem manifest the familiarities that served as its support the darknesses that bought about its clarity and all those far away things that secretly sustained it and made it go without saying 1994 447 Foucaults claim balances the wonder of the Romantic imperceptible embracing Outside with the required acknowledgement that the way reality is constituted and by whom is a ﬂawed result of regimes of power and masquerades of observa ble exteriority This directly correlates with the way woman has fallen Outside both phallocentric discourse and also navigates the desire to be Outside without being silenced or locked there by patriarchal forces Wolfes posthumanities via sexualities and animalities tends toward Jacques Derrida Judith Butler Bruno Latour and what could be argued a more American theoretical framework which privileges performativity in reference to sexuality and fetishisation in reference to animality Wolfe in his discussion of the place of ethics in posthuman theory explores the status of biotechnology another cyberfetish site for posthuman becomings Many other posthuman theorists tend toward Levinas Derrida Latour Haraway and Hayles while interestingly those theorists who are more aligned with my framework such as Rosi Braidotti Anna HickeyMoody Elizabeth Grosz Claire Colebrook and Felicity Colman seem to shy away from posthuman theory or are more critical of it emphasizing French feminism and the Nietzschian Bergsonian Spinozist Kristevan Irigarayan and DeleuzioGuattarian line This is the trajectory of posthuman feminism via which my understanding of posthuman sexuality emerges In a claim which both dispels all sexuality and by doing so opens up desire as an inﬁnite everything Foucault states it is not sufﬁcient to liberate sexuality it is also necessary to liberate ourselves from the notion of sexuality itself 2000 245 According to Braidotti 2013 98100 the key determining feature of post human sexualities comes from the shift from isomorphic binarism where the world and concepts are bifurcated into seeming oppositional categories which con ceal the dominance of one term perpetuated over the failure of the other term to achieve equivalence to rhizomatic connectivities Benhabib takes three elements of postmodern thought roughly translatable into posthumanism as problematic when formulating a feminist ethics for selfhood which resonate with posthuman philosophies within an explicitly feminist context due to their address to the most emphatic of all isomorphic dominant terms man These are the death of the sub ject what she calls The Death of Man the excavation of the truth of history or P MacCormack The Death of History and the death of the desire to master the self and the world by knowing everything The Death of Metaphysics 1992 211 Pepperell reﬂects on what could be called an additional death belonging to the Posthuman Condition the death of the discrete episteme in posthumanism where science meets philosophy He sees three key questions central to both science and philoso phy become defunct within the posthuman condition 1 That there will be an answer 2 That if there were an answer it would be satisfactory 3 That if the answer were satisfactory it would be because it provided a ﬁnal cause for human existence This ﬁnal cause would not be open to any further analysis of the kind that might ask what is the cause of the ﬁnal cause of human existence 1997 29 original emphasis Two major elements are responsible for or result from the death of the subject These are the ﬁguration of an embodied corporeal self as opposed to the transcendental or metaphysical and the need for different types of subject always housed in different types of bodies to become viable and ethically considered in culture particularly phallologocentric white capitalist culture This according to Guattari would be the machinic connectivity inherent in posthuman ity which replaces the diachronous ﬁnite couplings of oppositional binarised and asymmetrically empowered traits A machinics breaking with capitalist modes of thought would imply a refusal of the dichotomy between material processes and semiotic processes It would be brought to consider the deterritorializations of time and space only in connection with a new type of assemblage of enunciation new types of faciality traits refrains relations to the body sex the cosmos Guattari 2011 105 The idea of subjectivity is vast in philosophy yet constitutes any referent to ones sexuality as subjectivity in opposition or identical constitutes sexuality and even queer grapples with object and self as acting constituents but its ability to cross epistemes and indeed be the major focus of almost every question asked in every ﬁeld namely who or what am I psychically in psychoanalysis biologically in science and medicine metaphysically in philosophy elucidates the importance of being a subject in order to know what kind of subject one is Crucially however sex and sexuality distribute themselves within each of these epistemes so clearly haunt transgress and challenge all knowledges in their capa city to emerge as the thought of the body  that is the ﬂows and intensities from Outside by which bodies coalesce but which are not discrete and operational in any logical or demarcated manner Many feminists especially those who are sus picious of the representation or lack thereof of women in philosophy and the turn to the hyper technologised male of posthuman fetishism point to the redun dancy of the question who or what am I when it comes to women What does the death of subjectivity mean in postmodernism for those who never really had a selfdeﬁned subject to begin with For many feminists the question should have been acknowledged before posthumanism took ﬂight and made us all dissipative molecular constellations Many anxieties follow this question such as whether the death of subjectivity by male theorists is an appropriation of any subversive poten tial women had by being not fully ingrained by that idea of something to lose or whether the death of subjectivity means the wiping over of any history of Posthuman Sexuality From Ahumanity to Cosmogenic Desire oppression women may want to remember speciﬁcally due to their being women an anxiety Benhabib explicitly addresses in her argument on the death of the subject For in calling the death of subjectivity The Death of Man Benhabib points out that only man or male subjectivity has anything to lose through postmodern ism Mans desire was so exhaustively catalogued while womens was yetto come an arrival that in a liberating way happily never occurred By situating the postmodern postsubject posthuman within the two primary locations of corpore ality and difference postmodernism is giving women what they have always and already been condemned to  entrapment within their own ﬂesh that precedes any concept of self and is spoken for and about by others and a terminal othering from normalised axes of acceptability The desire of postmodern subjectivity in many ways is a desire to BecomeWoman Ironically and as Haraway tells us cyborgs always speak ironically 1990 149 Lacans perpetual question of what do women want coming from his anxieties over how they can be deﬁned in order that he may be deﬁned returns in posthumanities in the paradigmatic shift from the question who is the subject for feminists that never was for posthumanities that no longer is to how does the subject desire For here is found a profound alteration in concerns both for feminists and posthumanities  to deﬁne the subject is a humanist project to understand the subject as an expressive and affected con duit in perpetual relations with other expressive and affected entities via desire is the foundation of corporeal feminist posthumanities see eg MacCormack 2009 One of the most promising and contentious critiqued and celebrated elements of projects of becoming is becomingwoman It represents the pinnacle of Benhabibs anxieties about the death of subjectivity where the death of man has the potential to be the appropriation of woman by men Such a strategy enhances the subversive qualities of being oppressed and disdainful to dominant desirable male subjectivity without being accountable for this oppression or aware of the realities of living in a perhaps subversive but more pertinently often painful marginalised and most remarkably malegiven malearticulated body In a cynical explication I could suggest the desire to enter into a becomingwoman remains sufﬁciently within a binarised subjectobject dialectic but at least sees the oppressed term not as an object for consumption objectiﬁcation or domination but as an intensity or threshold which offers opportunities for escape from phallo logocentrism This problematic locus is where much of the arguments between trans subjects who wish to retain an operational binarised understanding of gender and socalled radical feminists occur But the important term seems to be increas ingly from a posthuman context at least less about women and more about desiring becoming The sexuality which is not desire for an objectterm but desire for metamorphosis itself is more valuable than the mythologised phantasy of the term woman And at least women are tactically human enough to respond albeit via minor language and thus are not coopted in the revolting manner much posthumanism perpetrates on nonhuman animals through assimilations of thor oughly human apprehensions of nonhuman behaviour and systems From ﬁghting for equality safety in our bodies and the ability to articulate our own selves the idea that our bodies are now fashionable theoretically and ripe for assimilation by P MacCormack the logic that marginalises us in the ﬁrst place is the current trend in posthuman theory Any desire to transform subjectivity potentially fails to address these pro blems because of the speaking position the thought presumes no longer exists may still exist or be important hence posthuman which when espoused by male theorists potentially believes female is a position no longer implicit and hence no longer pertinent The importance of maintaining an address to becoming woman despite its numerous valid criticism is twofold First where does the speciﬁcity of a lived womans body and history go when the desire to become process nonﬁxity and becoming replaces the idea of an historical embodied self This may help us reintroduce political materialism to posthuman experimentation Second does the creation of a constantly altering transforming self relinquish con cepts of accountability ethical responsibility and include responsibility for history My response to these questions is thus The activity of locating and transforming through others within the self produces an active engagement with 1 Concepts of other not limited by and not entirely deposing of the borders of the ﬂesh an embodied self which actively desires others as molecular not molar either the other in the self or other bodies which themselves have their own boundless others such that all speciﬁcities of all concrete others are actively engaged with at every moment a self which identiﬁes the borders of the ﬂesh and its histories but does not see them as indicative of wholes or organisms for the future due to such borders This is an ethical Spinozist map ping of the desiring body 2 Concepts which deconstruct sometimes violently any notion of the sanctity and integrity of a subject created to resemble a valuable capital commodity be it overvalued male subjectivity or objectiﬁed female biology This repudiates all oppositional sexual dialectics 3 The nature of what is being deconstructed so that history and accountability are always in process with transformation  we can transform to something else but we transform from whenever we transform to We may all be queer now but we do not forget what certain constitutions of sexuality did to minoritarians In another ironic turn then posthuman women are like Monique Wittigs les bians 1992 13 not actually women because they are delivered from an opposi tional structure Deleuze and Guattari point to the molar woman the little girl robbed of her own bodys potential who could have become woman molecularly piecebypiece with indeterminate speciﬁcities Through phallologocentric interven tion regulation or as Grosz calls it cultures most intensiﬁed disinvestments and recastings of the body 1994 174175 this little girl ceased becoming and is now being as stagnant as molarwoman Woman according to Deleuze and Guattari is deﬁned by a relation of movement and rest speed and slowness by a combination of atoms an emission of particles haeccity She never ceases to roam upon a body without organs She is an abstract line or a line of ﬂight Thus girls do not belong to an age group sex order or kingdom they slip in everywhere between orders acts ages sexes they pro duce n molecular sexes on the line of ﬂight in relation to the dualism machines they cross right though The only way to get out of the dualism is to bebetween  1987 276277 Posthuman Sexuality From Ahumanity to Cosmogenic Desire What Deleuze and Guattari fail to express is that this constant unbeing of woman who promises so much for becoming exists at a place or a bebetween that woman neither made for herself nor resides in willingly Feminism has attempted to reappropriate the inbetween and abstractedness of womans representation in culture in order to afﬁrm female being and take away the power of namingher there which phallologocentrism exercises Feminisms reappropriation of womans otherness is as much about a will to power and attaining a voice as it is a making valuable of any position woman ﬁnds herself in Inherent in this ﬁght against subjectiﬁcation is the inability to speak her desire Sexuality or rather desire is the force of femininity not the body per se What Deleuze and Guattari do is make desirable the position without acknowledging the importance of speak ing and valuing the position in the process of its becoming desirable Woman needs to speak her own subversion as much for the speech as for the subversion As Braidotti points out The problem for Deleuze is how to disengage the subject position woman from the dua listic structure that opposes it to the masculine norm thereby reducing it to a mirror image of the same  To put it in more feminist terms the problem is also how to free woman from the subjugated position of annexed other so as to make her expressive of a differ ent difference of pure difference of an entirely new plane of becoming out of which dif ferences can multiply and differ from each other Here the focus is more on the experience and the potential becoming of real life women in all of their diverse ways of understanding and inhabiting the subject position woman 1994 115 We are in a similarly dubious situation with reference to posthuman sexualities if we take the cyborg turn however Many cybertheorists and organisations such as Humanity formerly the World Transhumanist Organisation which attempt to think transhumanist futurity such as that of Extropy ethically and accountably embody or disembody a commitment to the human which has overcome human ness primarily through overcoming ﬁnitude In this way deﬁnitions of subjectivity also ceases to be a spectre but this futurity necessarily repudiates the now beyond its usefulness for an inﬁnite tomorrowing so material immanence the newness of any dividuated lifes existence in relation with that of others is maligned Extropy could be described as the cyberbiotechnological version of humanist transcendental practice while Humanity exhibits anxieties about asymmetry in access distribution and manipulation Just as certain theorists see the posthuman as coming from an outside imposed upon the base material of the human so trans humant theory insinuates this cannot be enough as if there is an inherent ﬂaw in human materiality A paradigmatic equivalence could be made here between phal lologocentric economies of lack where the absence of the phallus or its threatened truncation or castration misses entirely the multiplicity and metamorphic morpho logical mucosity of the vulva Luce Irigaray and alternate ways of reading the body at all Antonin Artaud and Deleuze and Guattari The symbolic to asignify ing genitals addressing sexual difference as the ﬁrst step away from the majoritar ian human seem almost quaint when thinking the new grand narrative of the human itself thinking it in order to unthink it expunge it from its relationship with the humans who at worst question the category of the human only in order P MacCormack to exclude any limitations or accountabilities in reference to immanent existences of other lives including other human lives be they considered majoritarian human or minoritarian ﬂesh In the deiﬁcation of biotechnology the cyborgs attractive elements which can be found in the most rudimentary feminist queer postcolonial studies  the incomplete the hybrid the germinal through denial of access to signifying systems  are offered as a future design for the inﬁnite human It is as if all the very characteristics which made minoritarians abject have been apprehended by biotechnology with an adamant forgetting of their former use as tools of oppression Why signifying systems hated the minoritarian is why they love the cyborg This is primarily due to the fact that both repudiate the human But criticisms of the desire to enter into a becomingcyborg or becomingwoman remain  a perceived aversion to material speciﬁcity the privileging of an idea tional projection over a speciﬁc singular and unique event of existence a perpe tuation of the humanist turn to deﬁning even if via nondeﬁning fetishism and fear borne of the fact we are scared because we never were human in the ﬁrst place If desire and sexuality are the jubilant loci for posthumanism which addresses feminist concerns then they are also the loci for fear for the majoritarian This may be why post and transhumanist philosophies are still relatively ﬁne with reproduc tion in the bed or the test tube but recoil when having to deal with hereandnow concerns such as the lives which are without qualifying what they are and the cessation of human reproduction proposed so elegantly by a more material and ethical posthuman movements such as the human extinction movement and the Church of Euthanasia If the modern age delivered sexuality from reproduction the posthuman age has turned reproduction into a desire to live forever sterilising car nality by almost denying its importance Along with the perhaps seemingly nihilistic sounding but utterly afﬁrmative vindication of human extinction and care of immanent and living life posthuman sexuality performs over an immortalising obsession with lives yet to come into being posthuman sexualities have diversiﬁed toward monsters spiritualities with out theism and on a grander scale a cosmic understanding of connectivity that could be described as cosmogenic For this reason the word posthuman has been challenged ﬁrst with transhumanism but now the Ahuman is used to express a here and now excess which is the already posthuman inherent in concepts such as jouissance and desire see MacCormack 2014 Ahuman theory knows neither futurefetish nor nostalgia it reputes all bifurcations  of object and subject human and animal ﬁctive and factual  via what Irigaray would call mucosal desire and Serres a cosmogenic mode of interaction Where the posthuman fetishising of others critiqued in becomingwoman and animal but also any cooption of a non human or idea which is utilised as a cipher toward posthuman desiring is deeply problematic ahumanity seeks the liberation of human life from human traits and deﬁnitions  which are increasingly destructive and malignant in relation to the connectivity of life on earth without assimilating any one of those other forms of life Irigaray utilises a desiring relationship with angels which offers a fascinating way of introducing spirituality as a mystical but deeply material ethics indepen dent of God or Gods or goddesses as a schema for encounters with Outside but Posthuman Sexuality From Ahumanity to Cosmogenic Desire devoid of utilising a subaltern to achieve these encounters The consequences of such nonfulﬁllment of the sexual act remain  to take only the most beautiful example  let us consider the angels These messengers are never immobile nor do they ever dwell in one single place As mediators of what has not yet taken place these angels therefore open up the closed nature of the world identity action history 1992 173 Angelic love is formed of what Irigaray calls a muco sal consistency It ﬁnds itself alighting upon fabulated creatures This aligns with the turn to teratology by such theorists as Haraway Braidotti and MacCormack in feminist posthumanities whereby the fabulated creature demands imagination in reference to means of escape from fetishising posthuman discourses which perpe tuate phallic compulsions Irigaray utilises the mucosal model to foil the privile ging of binaries privileging of the visual and a repudiation of desire and abjection Nor will I ever see the mucous that most intimate interior of my ﬂesh neither the touch of the outside of the skin of my ﬁngers nor the perception of the inside of these same ﬁngers but another threshold of the passage from outside to inside from inside to outside between inside and outside between outside and inside Irigaray 1993 142 The angel both awaits as the not yet and is already the quickened with us Here the body effaces itself in order to call forth another body here the body is annihilated and becomes a tiny pile of ashes in order that the existence of other bodies may rise up the immense legion of angels of absence Serres 1995 45 The self becomes ashes from the burning of ecstasy and phoenixes pluralized This stands in marked juxtaposition against compulsion toward reproduction of the same of humans of acts of identities of perception and the manic need for extension of life the my of my life afﬁrmed in the my of my consistent perception of exhaustible meaning beginning with who I am and what I desire all defunct in posthuman sexuality Cosmogenics interrogates and relishes the inﬁnite teeming and potentialities of the immanent Universe which are inherently present in all ter ritories without cyborg fantasies or devolutionary cooptions Cosmogenics encourages expressivity in alterity as inﬁnite intensities and openness to affect all without the imposition of structure This is desire as ecstatic and activist a Spinozist ethical project From angels and monsters to the unbearable impercept ibility of all as desire and desire as all feminist posthuman sexualities trace a chaos of desire to elucidate the ways feminism was always both posthuman and ahuman and tactics by which experimental and celebratory posthuman sexualities can facilitate ethical affects to open the world to all expressions of life
