my lucky stars for Allison artist and soul mate xi Introduction What Is Posthumanism It is perhaps an appropriately posthumanist gesture to begin this book with the results of a Google search As I write in summer of 2008 if you Google humanism youll be rewarded with 3840000 hits posthumanism yields a mere 60200 Apparently humanism is alive and well despite reports of its demise You will notice at a cur sory glance that despite the discrepancy in numbers there appears to be much more unanimity about humanism than posthumanism Most definitions of humanism look something like the following one from Wikipedia Humanism is a broad category of ethical philosophies that affirm the dignity and worth of all people based on the ability to determine right and wrong by appeal to universal human qualitiesparticularly ra tionality It is a component of a variety of more specific philosophical systems and is incorporated into several religious schools of thought Humanism entails a commitment to the search for truth and morality through human means in support of human interests In focusing on the capacity for selfdetermination humanism rejects the validity of transcendental justifications such as a dependence on belief without reason the supernatural or texts of allegedly divine origin Humanists endorse universal morality based on the commonality of the human condition suggesting that solutions to human social and cultural prob lems cannot be parochial Posthumanism on the other hand generates different and even irrec oncilable definitions The Web site wwwposthumanismcom provides a gloss on the term that most of the philosophers and scholars named on Wikipedias page for posthumanismMichel Foucault Judith Butler Bruno Latour and Donna Haraway among otherswould not just refine but for the most part oppose For the purposes of this book I choose to see in this confusion not a cautionary tale but an opportunity introduction xii The term posthumanism itself seems to have worked its way into contemporary critical discourse in the humanities and social sci ences during the mid1990s though its roots go back in one genealogy at least to the 1960s and pronouncements of the sort made famous by Foucault in the closing paragraph of The Order of Things An Archaeology of the Human Sciences where he writes that the historical appearance of this thing called man was not the transition into luminous consciousness of an ageold concern the entry into objectivity of something that had long remained trapped within beliefs and philosophies it was the effect of a change in the fundamental arrangements of knowledge As the archaeology of our thought easily shows man is an invention of recent date And one per haps nearing its end If those arrangements were to disappear as they appeared if some event of which we can at the moment do no more than sense the possibilitywithout knowing either what its form will be or what it promiseswere to cause them to crumble as the ground of Classical thought did at the end of the eighteenth century then one can cer tainly wager that man would be erased like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea1 By way of another wellknown genealogyone also directly relevant to this bookposthumanism may be traced to the Macy conferences on cybernetics from 1946 to 1953 and the invention of systems the ory involving Gregory Bateson Warren McCulloch Norbert Wiener John von Neumann and many other figures from a range of fields who converged on a new theoretical model for biological mechanical and communicational processes that removed the human and Homo sapi ens from any particularly privileged position in relation to matters of meaning information and cognition More recently the term has begun to emerge with different and sometimes competing meanings The first time I used it hyphenated no less was in an essay from 1995 called In Search of Posthumanist Theory on the work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela in a special double issue of Cultural Critique called The Politics of Systems and Environments that I coedited with William Rasch2 That project included a roundtable conversation with Niklas Luhmann and Katherine Hayles Hayles picked up the term with a rather differ xiii introduction ent valence as we will see in a moment in her book How We Became Posthuman 1999 Meanwhile in the United Kingdom critics such as Neil Badmington and Elaine Graham gravitated toward the term with Badmingtons edited collection Posthumanism 2000 being a notable at tempt at consolidation3 That body of work in the UK as suggested by the title of Badmingtons subsequent book Alien Chic Posthumanism and the Other Within and by Grahams Representations of the PostHuman Monsters Aliens and Others in Popular Culture tended toward a sense of posthumanism perhaps best glossed as Badmington rightly introduction xiv empirical science and critical reasonrather than revelation and re ligious authorityas ways of learning about the natural world and our place within it and of providing a grounding for morality Trans humanism has its roots in rational humanism6 To help make his point Bostrom invokes Kants famous essay of 1784 What Is Enlightenment Enlightenment is mans leaving his selfcaused immaturity Immaturity is the incapacity to use ones own understanding without the guidance of another    The motto of en lightenment is therefore Sapere aude Have courage to use your own in telligence7 Here however it is useful to recall Foucaults suggestion from his essay of 1984 by the same title that if we commit to a perma nent critique of ourselves then we must avoid the always too facile confusions between humanism and Enlightenment because the hu manistic thematic is in itself too supple too diverse too inconsistent to serve as an axis for reflection Indeed as Foucault xv introduction invoked by Balibars reference to the humanityanimality dichotomy namely that the human is achieved by escaping or repressing not just its animal origins in nature the biological and the evolutionary but more generally by transcending the bonds of materiality and em bodiment altogether In this respect my sense of posthumanism is the opposite of transhumanism and in this light transhumanism should be seen as an intensification of humanism Indeed one wellknown fig ure associated with transhumanism Hans Moravec draws Hayless ire for precisely this reason When Moravec imagines you choosing to download yourself into a computer thereby obtaining through techno logical mastery the ultimate privilege of immortality Hayles writes he is not abandoning the autonomous liberal subject but is expanding its prerogatives into the realm of the posthuman10 Hayles is no doubt right and though she is quick to add that the posthuman need not be recuperated back into liberal humanism nor need it be construed as antihuman the net effect and critical ground tone of her book as many have noted are to associate the posthuman with a kind of trium phant disembodiment11 Hayless use of the term in other words tends to oppose embodiment and the posthuman whereas the sense in which I am using the term here insists on exactly the opposite posthumanism in my sense isnt posthuman at allin the sense of being after our embodiment has been transcendedbut is only posthumanist in the sense that it opposes the fantasies of disembodiment and autonomy inherited from humanism itself that Hayles rightly criticizes My sense of posthumanism is thus analogous to JeanFrançois Lyotards paradoxical rendering of the postmodern it comes both be fore and after humanism before in the sense that it names the embodi ment and embeddedness of the human being in not just its biological but also its technological world the prosthetic coevolution of the human animal with the technicity of tools and external archival mechanisms such as language and culture of which Bernard Stiegler probably re mains our most compelling and ambitious theoristand all of which comes before that historically specific thing called the human that Foucaults archaeology excavates12 But it comes after in the sense that posthumanism names a historical moment in which the decentering of the human by its imbrication in technical medical informatic and economic networks is increasingly impossible to ignore a historical introduction xvi development that points toward the necessity of new theoretical para digms but also thrusts them on us a new mode of thought that comes after the cultural repressions and fantasies the philosophical protocols and evasions of humanism as a historically specific phenomenon Here we would do well to recall Foucaults insistence on the dif ference between humanism and Enlightenment thoughtnamely that humanisms anthropological universals underwrite a dogma for which the Enlightenment if we are true to its spirit should have no patience As Foucault puts it In this connection I believe that this the matic which so often recurs and which always depends on humanism can be opposed by the principle of a critique and a permanent creation of ourselves in our autonomy that is a principle that is at the heart of the historical consciousness that the Enlightenment has of itself From this standpoint I am inclined to see Enlightenment and humanism in a state of tension rather than identity13 It is precisely at this juncture that I want to locate a fundamental intervention that this book attempts to make namely that even if we admire humanisms suspicion toward revelation and religious authority whose stakes are all the more pitched at the current geopolitical moment14 and even if we take the additional posthumanist step of rejecting the various anthropological political and scientific dogmas of the human that Foucault insists are in tension with Enlightenment per se we must take yet another step another post and realize that the nature of thought itself must change if it is to be posthumanist What this means is that when we talk about posthumanism we are not just talking about a thematics of the decentering of the human in relation to either evolutionary ecological or technological coordi nates though that is where the conversation usually begins and all too often ends rather I will insist that we are also talking about how thinking confronts that thematics what thought has to become in the face of those challenges Here the spirit of my intervention is akin to Foucaults in What Is Enlightenment the point is not to reject hu manism tout courtindeed there are many values and aspirations to admire in humanismbut rather to show how those aspirations are undercut by the philosophical and ethical frameworks used to concep tualize them To take only two examples that I discuss later in this book most of us would probably agree that cruelty toward animals is xvii introduction a bad thing or that people with disabilities deserve to be treated with respect and equality But as we will see the philosophical and theo retical frameworks used by humanism to try to make good on those commitments reproduce the very kind of normative subjectivitya specific concept of the humanthat grounds discrimination against nonhuman animals and the disabled in the first place Similar limitations may be identified not just in the post of trans humanism but also in some who rightly criticize it As R L Rutsky points out with regard to Hayless governing theoretical model The posthuman cannot simply be identified as a culture or age that comes after the human for the very idea of such a passage however mea sured or qualified it may be continues to rely upon a humanist narra tive of historical change    If however the posthuman truly involves a fundamental change or mutation in the concept of the human this would seem to imply that history and culture cannot continue to be figured in reference to this concept15 In other words there are hu manist ways of criticizing the extension of humanism that we find in transhumanism or bad posthumanism Rutsky locates a central symptom of this fact in Hayless use of the concept of mutation in How We Became Posthuman where mutation is rendered Rutsky writes as a preexisting external force that introduces change into a stable pattern or code and into the material world or body as well But mutation Rutsky points out by definition cannot be seen as external random ness that imposes itself upon the biological or material worldnor for that matter on the realm of culture Rather mutation names that ran domness which is always already immanent in the processes by which both material bodies and cultural patterns replicate themselves16 From this vantage the problem is that there is nothing in Hayless theoretical model of historical progression which is derived from a specific set of humanist conventions and protocols of historiography whose problematic nature Foucault himselfunder the influence of Canguilhem among others17sought to expose that takes this fact into account Moreover her notion of mutation as an external force points as Bruce Clarke has recently put it toward a radical distinc tion between matter and information substance and form one that remains in a realm of dialectical antithesis which observes that the concept of the human has lost its balance andor its foundations and introduction xviii that responds either with lament or delight18 But what is needed here as Rutsky rightly points out is the recognition that any notion of the posthuman that is to be more than merely an extension of the human that is to move beyond the dialectic of control and lack of control superhuman and inhuman must be premised upon a mutation that is ongoing and immanent and this means that to become posthuman means to participate inand find a mode of thought adequate to processes which can never be entirely reduced to patterns or stan dards codes or information19 In this light it is worth recalling Clarkes suggestion that the dia lectical antithesis of matter and information corresponds to the first order cybernetics of midcentury20 while the mutational as Rutsky rightly understands it points toward the necessity of a different logic one consonant as Clarke has pointed out by quoting Gregory Batesons suggestion three decades ago that the whole of logic would have to be reconstructed for recursiveness a logic that is fundamental to the secondorder systems theory that will be articulated in these pages From this perspective I want to underscore what will be a major point of emphasis in this book that systems theory in its secondorder incar nation far from eluding or narratologically mastering the mutational processes just discussed rather subjects itself to themtraces or tracks them as Derrida might say for reasons that will become clear later in just the way Bateson calls for As Dirk Baecker puts it secondorder systems theory may well be read as an attempt to do away with any usual notion of system the theory in a way being the deconstruction of its central term21 Moreover it is also worth remembering Derridas suggestion in his late essay The Animal That Therefore I Am More to Follow that perhaps the deepest logic of his investigation of the question of the animal is in fact viral in the specific sense of a muta tional logic of the trace structure of any notational form any semiotic system that exceeds and encompasses the boundary not just between human and animal but also between the living or organic and the me chanical or technicala contention I take up in some detail in chapters 1 and 222 And it is precisely at this juncture that this book weaves together the two different senses of posthumanism that remained separate in my previous two books Critical Environments and Animal Rites posthumanism as a mode of thought in the first book explored xix introduction there on the parallel terrains of pragmatism systems theory and post structuralism and in the second posthumanism as engaging directly the problem of anthropocentrism and speciesism and how practices of thinking and reading must change in light of their critique It is worth amplifying for a moment the disciplinary institu tional ethical and political stakes of this mutational viral or parasitic form of thinking As David Wills introduction xx travelers in posthumanist thought There is the Lacanian version ar ticulated most recently by Slavoj Žižek according to which the self referential attempts of the domain of the Symbolic to give meaning to or gentrify the domain of the presymbolic Real only generate as a precipitate or remainder of that process the very outside of the Real now understood paradoxically as both pre and postSymbolic they attempt to master24 There is the nearly Zenlike assertion of Gilles Deleuze that I am an empiricist that is a pluralist his at tempt with Félix Guattari to arrive at the magic formula we all seek pluralism  monism by passing through all the dualisms which are the enemy the altogether necessary enemy25 There is Bruno Latours wellknown assertion that we have never been modern his insistence that the fundamental mechanism of modernity creates two entirely distinct ontological zones that of human beings on the one hand that of nonhumans on the other even as it proliferates hybrids of nature and culture26 And there is Foucaults archaeology of humanism to which I have already alluded But the first lesson of both Derrida and Luhmann and in this they go beyond Foucaults genealogical method and beyond dia lectical and historical accounts of the sort we find in Hayles is that Enlightenment rationality is not as it were rational enough because it stops short of applying its own protocols and commitments to itself This is of course the entire point of Derridas deconstruction of many of the major concepts texts and figures in the Western philosophical tradition And it is also the point of Luhmanns attention to the formal dynamics of meaning that arise from the unavoidably paradoxical self reference of any observationa problem that is for him a historical phenomenon created by modernity as a form of functional differen tiation of social systems Long before the historical onset of cyborg technologies that now so obviously inject the post into the posthuman in ways that fascinate the transhumanists functional differentiation itself determines the posthumanist form of meaning reason and com munication by untethering it from its moorings in the individual subjectivity and consciousness Meaning now becomes a specifically modern form of selfreferential recursivity that is used by both psychic systems consciousness and social systems communication to handle overwhelming environmental complexity In this sense Luhmann takes xxi introduction the Kantian commitment to the autonomy of reason seriously but then submits that autonomy to the unavoidable problem of paradoxical self referenceand in that sense he takes reason more seriously than Kant himself did or at least takes it to require a more complex theoretical apparatus because of the increased complexity associated with moder nity as functional differentiation27 As Luhmann puts it in Observations on Modernity The history of European rationality can be described as the history of the dissolution of a rationality continuum that had connected the observer in the world with the world28 To call such a shift historical is not however to fall back into the narrative histo riographic method I and Foucault have just criticized since this new logic itself virally infects or deconstructs if you like any possible his torical accounta fact that paradoxically if you like makes such an account historically representative that is to say in Luhmanns terms it makes it modern29 Thus what Derrida and Luhmann insist on more than any of the thinkers just noted is a thinking that does not turn away from the complexities and paradoxes of selfreferential autopoiesis quite the contrary it finds there precisely the means to articulate what I will call the principle of openness from closure which may itself be seen as the successor to the order from noise principle associated with first order systems theory and inherited by successors such as complexity theory30 Here the emphasis falls as it did not in these earlier theories on the paradoxical fact theorized by both Luhmann and Derrida the very thing that separates us from the world connects us to the world and selfreferential autopoietic closure far from indicating a kind of solipsistic neoKantian idealism actually is generative of openness to the environment As Luhmann succinctly puts it selfreferential closure does not contradict the systems openness to the environment Instead in the selfreferential mode of operation closure is a form of broaden ing possible environmental contacts closure increases by constituting elements more capable of being determined the complexity of the en vironment that is possible for the system31 In Derridas terms The living present springs forth out of its nonidentity with itself and from the possibility of a retentional trace which constitutes the intimate relation of the living present to its outside the opening to exteriority in general32 introduction xxii It is crucial as we shall see in the following chapters that the dynamics described here are not for Luhmann or for Derrida limited to the domain of the human It is thus also in this precise sensethe sense in which the viral logic articulated here must be extended as Derrida insists to the entire field of the living or rather to the lifedeath relation33that the animal question is part of the larger question of posthumanism Indeed for Derrida these dynamics form the basis for deconstructing the various ways in which we have presumed to master or appropriate the finitude we share with nonhuman animals in ways presumably barred to them as in the ability to know the world as such through our possession of language that is barred to animals according to Heidegger It is on the strength of that deconstruction that the question of our ethical relation to animals is opened anew and as it were kept open In this connection my use of Derrida and Luhmann here constitutes an extension and refinement of my deploy ment of the work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela in In the Shadow of Wittgensteins Lion where the emphasis falls on their contention that every act of knowing brings forth world On the one hand they point out that for us as languaging beings every reflec tion including one on the foundation of human knowledge invariably takes place in language which is our distinctive way of being human and being humanly active in the world34 On the other hand language arisesas it does in Luhmanns account of meaning versus language properfrom fundamentally ahuman evolutionary processes of third order structural couplings and recursive coontogenies linked in com plex forms of social behavior and communication among socalled higher animals which have themselves emerged from specific forms of embodiment and neurophysiological organization Indeed as we will see in chapter 1 there are at least three differ ent levels here that must be disarticulated first the selfreferential au topoiesis of a biological systems material substrate its conservation of adaptation through autopoietic closure on the basis of whichand only on the basis of whichit can engage in various forms of structural coupling second the selfreferential formal dynamics of meaning what Maturana and Varela will call in the arena of living systems the emergence of linguistic domains that some but not all autopoietic systems use to reduce environmental complexity and interface with the xxiii introduction world and third the selfreference of language proper as a secondorder phenomenon and a specific medium what Luhmann calls a symboli cally generalized communications medium that is used by some but not all autopoietic systems that use meaning None of these levels is reducible to the others each has its own dynamics its own evolution ary history its own constraints and protocols But this irreducibility far from frustrating our attempts at explanation actually greatly en hances them by necessitating what Maturana calls a nonreductionist relation between the phenomenon to be explained and the mechanism that generates it As Maturana explains the actual result of a process and the operations in the process that give rise to it in a generative rela tion intrinsically take place in independent and nonintersecting phenomenal domains This situation is the reverse of reductionism And this per mits us to see he continues particularly in the domain of biology that there are phenomena like language mind or consciousness that require an interplay of bodies as a generative structure but do not take place in any of them35what we will shortly see Luhmann theorizing in chapter 1 as the difference between consciousness and communica tion psychic systems and social systems which may nevertheless be coupled structurally through media such as language This view has profound implications of course for how we think about the human in relation to the animal about the body and em bodiment To begin with it means that we can no longer talk of the body or even for that matter of a body in the traditional sense We take for granted in other words Bruno Latours assertion that the human form is as unknown to us as the nonhuman    It is better to speak of xmorphism instead of becoming indignant when humans are treated as nonhumans or vice versa36 Rather the body is now seen as a kind of virtuality but one that is precisely for that reason all the more real If we believe as I think we must the contention that neurophysiologically different autopoietic lifeforms bring forth a world in what Maturana and Varela call their embodied enaction and if in doing so the environment is thus different indeed sometimes radically different for different lifeformsthen the environment and with it the body becomes unavoidably a virtual multidimensional space produced and stabilized by the recursive enactions and struc tural couplings of autopoietic beings who share what Maturana and introduction xxiv Varela call a consensual domain First there is noise multiplicity complexity and the heterogeneity of the environment of what is I put first in quotation marks to underscore the fact that such a statement could only arise after all as the observation of an autopoietic system hence first here also means because of the inescapable fact of the selfreference of such an observation last it is the environment of the system not nature or any other given anteriority37 Second there are the autopoietic systems that if they are to continue their existence respond to this overwhelming complexity by reducing it in terms of the selectivity of a selfreferential selectivity or code and this means third that the world is an ongoing differentiated construction and creation of a shared environment sometimes converging in a consen sual domain sometimes not by autopoietic entities that have their own temporalities chronicities perceptual modalities and so on in short their own forms of embodiment Fourth the world is thus a virtuality and a multiplicity it is both what one does in embodied enaction and what the selfreference of that enaction excludes Again Luhmann Reality is what one does not perceive when one perceives it Crucially then virtual does not mean not real on the con trary given the openness from closure principle the more virtual the world is the more real it is because the buildup of internal complexity made possible by autopoietic closure actually increases the complexity of the environment that is possible for any system In that sense it in creases the systems connection and sensitivity to and dependence on the environment Rethinking embodiment in this way one might be tempted to invoke Deleuze and Guattaris wellknown idea of the body without organs along the lines usefully glossed by Brian Massumi Since the body is an open system an infolding of impulses from an aleatory out side all its potential singular states are determined by a fractal attrac tor Call that strange attractor the bodys plane of consistency It is a subset of the worlds plane of consistency a segment of its infinite frac tal attractor It is the body as pure potential pure virtuality38 But taking seriously the concept of autopoiesisthat systems including bodies are both open and closed as the very condition of possibility for their exis tence open on the level of structure to energy flows environmental per turbations and the like but closed on the level of selfreferential organi xxv introduction zation as Maturana and Varela put it and taking seriously Maturanas assertion that a description in language and the generative phenomena to be described take place in independent and nonintersecting phe nomenal domains there can be no talk of the bodys plane of consis tency being a subset of the worlds plane of consistency And there can be no talk of purity Everything we know scientifically theoretically and say linguistically or in other forms of semiotic notation about the body takes place within some contingent radically nonnatural that is constructed and technical schema of knowledge The language or meaning more strictly speaking that describes is of a different phe nomenal order from that which is described Paradoxically that lan guage is fundamental to our embodied enaction our bringing forth a world as humans And yet it is dead Rather as Derrida puts it quite precisely it exceeds and encompasses the lifedeath relation That fact doesnt prevent in the least its effectivity since effectivity as Latour among others has shown is not a matter of philosophical or theoreti cal representationalism39 To return then to the question of posthumanism the perspec tive I attempt to formulate herefar from surpassing or rejecting the humanactually enables us to describe the human and its character istic modes of communication interaction meaning social significa tions and affective investments with greater specificity once we have removed meaning from the ontologically closed domain of conscious ness reason reflection and so on It forces us to rethink our takenfor granted modes of human experience including the normal perceptual modes and affective states of Homo sapiens itself by recontextualizing them in terms of the entire sensorium of other living beings and their own autopoietic ways of bringing forth a worldways that are since we ourselves are human animals part of the evolutionary history and behavioral and psychological repertoire of the human itself But it also insists that we attend to the specificity of the humanits ways of being in the world its ways of knowing observing and describingby paradoxically for humanism acknowledging that it is fundamentally a prosthetic creature that has coevolved with various forms of tech nicity and materiality forms that are radically nothuman and yet have nevertheless made the human what it is For Derrida of course this includes the most fundamental prostheticity of all language in the introduction xxvi broadest sense As I have already noted this prostheticity this consti tutive dependency and finitude has profound ethical implications for our relations to nonhuman forms of lifea point I will discuss in some detail in the first half of the book40 It also changes how we think about normal human experience and how that experience gets refracted or queried in specific modes and media of artistic and cultural practice that form the focus of the books second part The theoretical approaches I have been sketching here will be developed in greater detail in chapter 1 which attempts a sort of cross articulation of the theoretical approaches of Jacques Derrida and Niklas Luhmann not least to provide a context for a lesskneejerk response for Luhmanns work than it has been accustomed to thus far in the United States Here apropos David Willss earlier observation about the selfassurance of any hegemonic discourse or practice it is worth mentioning that the situation is quite different outside the United States especially in Europe where systems theory is widely dissemi nated and influential in academic and intellectual life A central con tention here will be that the similarities between systems theory and deconstruction have been hard to see because both converge on their central concept of difference from opposite directions While Derridas work begins by confronting a logocentric philosophical tradition in which difference must be released in its immanence through the work of deconstruction for Luhmann difference names an evolutionary and adaptive problemspecifically the fact of overwhelming envi ronmental complexitythat any system must find a way of address ing if it wants to continue its autopoiesis Against this background Derrida and Luhmann emerge as exemplary posthumanist theorists I argue because both refuse to locate meaning in the realm of either the human or for that matter the biological Moreover both insist on the crucial disarticulation of what Luhmann calls psychic systems and social systems consciousness and communication in ways famously insisted on in Derridas early critique of the selfpresence of speech and autoaffection of the voice For both the form of meaning is the true substrate of the coevolution of psychic systems and social systems and this means that the human is at its core and in its very constitution radically ahuman and constitutively prosthetic Chapter 2 moves this question of meaningits form its evolution xxvii introduction into two additional contexts that will be important for the book as a whole the question of animal intelligence and communication and the question of disciplinarity A central argument of this chapter is that Derridas theory of language in the broadest sense akin to Luhmanns meaning and its relationship to questions of subjectivity intentional ity and the like help us see how philosophers of cognitive science such as Daniel Dennett remain within the very Cartesianism they are trying to escape Because of their reliance on an essentially representational ist theory of language that many trained in the humanities would find dubious at best CogSci figures such as Dennett not only reinscribe the Cartesian subject that their functionalism wants to critique but also reinstate the ontological difference between humans and animals familiar to us from the philosophical traditiona difference that turns out to have dire ethical consequences in Dennetts work Just how dif ficult that Cartesianism is to escape is revealed in Derridas analysis of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacans rendering of the humananimal divide in light of his theory of the subject of the signifiera theory that shares more with the Cartesianism of Dennetts analytic approach on this question than one might have expected Chapter 3the longest and most ambitious in the bookexplores in much greater detail the relationship between different philosophi cal approaches and the ethical consequences attendant on those dif ferences for thinking our relations with nonhuman animals discussed in the previous chapter I begin by casting a hard look at the more familiar and institutionally powerful forms of bioethics which emerge in this discussion as less an ethics per se than a branch of policy stud ies within the historical development of what Foucault calls biopower and governmentality With regard to the specific ethical question I focus on here the standing of nonhuman animals bioethics takes for granted the underlying moral hierarchy of humananimal that it ought to be committed to questioning We need to look elsewhere I suggest for more searching engagements with this problem and I begin by examining briefly Martha Nussbaums recent attempt in Frontiers of Justice to apply an Aristotelian capabilities approach focused on the flourishing of particular species to the question of justice and spe cies difference Despite its admirable focus on vulnerability finitude and embodiment as crucial dimensions of ethical thought Nussbaums introduction xxviii work is hampered by numerous problems not the least of which is its odd combination of analytic imprecision and programmatic insistence so I turn to the philosopher Cora Diamonds remarkable body of work on this problem which is interested not just in the question of ethics and animals but also in how confronting that question changes how we think about what justice is and what philosophy itself may be Under the influence of Stanley Cavells work on philosophical skepticism Diamond asks us not to mistake the difficulty of philoso phy a propositional ifPthenQ kind of difficulty for the difficulty of reality which she finds on display in the novelist J M Coetzees character Elizabeth Costello in The Lives of Animals who is wounded and haunted by the animal holocaust going on around us daily in practices such as factory farming Diamonds searching and original analysis points us toward a fact that will I argue require Derridas work to fully articulate that we share with nonhuman animals not just one form of finitude but two not just the radical passivity and vul nerability announced in Jeremy Benthams famous assertion that the question is not can they talk or can they reason but can they suf fer but also the kind of finitude articulated by Derrida in his critique of Lacan That second form of finitude derives from the fundamental exteriority and materiality of meaning and communication itself of any form of semiotic marking and iterability to which both humans and nonhuman animals are subject in a trace structure that as he puts it exceeds and encompasses the humananimal difference and indeed the lifedeath relation itself For this reason we cannot master and erase in any analytic of finitude or existential of beingtowarddeath as in Heidegger our radical passivity in a way that would once again separate us definitively and ontologically from nonhuman animals Chapter 4 attempts to intervene at a crucial moment in the de velopment of what has recently come to be called animal studies by engaging with the question of disciplinarity In doing so it revisits and formalizes the questions of disciplinarity namely what is philosophy that animated the previous chapter but it explores that question on the terrain of current US literary and cultural studies and their ruling dis ciplinary norms which are at the current moment historicist They are historicist of a particular variety as it turns out one that takes for granted and reproduces a specific picture of the knowing subject xxix introduction that undercuts the putative historicist commitment to the material ity heterogeneity and externality of historical forces a subject that is clearly to put it in the terms of a Marxist historicism largely evacuated or at least domesticated in current literary and cultural studies an ideo logical expression of liberalism It is on this level I argue that the real force of animal studies is occluded and compromised by many of the assumptions and practices that are mobilized by the template on which it is modeled namely cultural studies Rather the full force of animal studieswhat makes it not just another flavor of fill in the blank stud ies on the model of media studies film studies womens studies ethnic studies and so onis that it fundamentally unsettles and reconfigures the question of the knowing subject and the disciplinary paradigms and procedures that take for granted its form and reproduce it To put it an other way there are humanist ways and there are posthumanist ways of engaging in this supposedly always already posthumanist pursuit called animal studies It is hereand not in the simple fact that various disciplines have recently converged on an object of study called the animalthat the deepest challenge to the disciplines posed by animal studies may be felt Chapter 5 broadens this question of posthumanist studies to in clude disability studies as well and revisits the relationship between language subjectivity and phenomenology explored in chapter 2 Here I focus on the fascinating figure of Temple Grandin perhaps the best known representative of an emergent area of contemporary US culture in which animal studies and disability studies converge Both disability studies and animal studies are interested in rethinking from the ground up as it were questions of subjectivity bodily experience mental life intersubjectivity and the ethical and even political changes attendant on reopening those questions in light of new knowledge about the life experiences of nonhuman animals and those who are called problem atically no doubt the disabled In Grandins case she insists that her specific condition a form of autism known as Aspergers syndrome enables her to understand more deeply how nonhuman animals such as cows perceive and experience the world and she has integrated that understanding she claims into her designs for animal holding facilities throughout North America I am interested here in how Grandins case helps us radically denaturalize many of the takenforgranted modes introduction xxx of human perception and mentation of normatesnot least visual experience and an entire set of assumptions about the relationship be tween language and thought that I have examined in earlier chapters I am also interested as I end this chapter in Grandins insistence that disability becomes an important form of abledness in opening up trans species modes of identification and thus helps us to disclose how we need to rethink the underlying models of subjectivity that ground the dominant discourses in disability studies drawn as they are from the liberal democratic framework and its casting of subjectivity in terms of agency autonomy and the like The second half of the book does not by any means abandon the theoretical and ethical frames that occupy part I rather part II contin ues to develop them but on different terrain by engaging in detailed readings and interpretations of a range of cultural and artistic prac tices that exemplify a posthumanist sensibility or problematic as they emerge and are worked through in particular media and art forms Chapter 6 continues to excavate the question of visuality in relation to the problem of humanism but does so by linking it to an overt the matics of nonhuman life and the question of its ethical standing that dominates the work of two very different and important contempo rary artists Eduardo Kac and Sue Coe What I am interested in here to put it schematically is the following question What is the relationship if indeed there is one between representationalism and speciesism What is the connection between an artistic mode or medium and the ways of seeing and experiencing the world that they take for granted and how do those index a certain kind of perceiving experiencing sub ject By using the work of Michael Fried and Derrida to read Sue Coes enormous and compelling project Dead Meata compilation of draw ings paintings and sketches based on her visits to slaughterhouses in the United States and abroadI try to show how art that is dedicated to exposing the horrors of anthropocentrism and the violence toward animals that it countenances may nevertheless be in its very strategies and despite itself humanist and anthropocentric On the other hand art such as Eduardo Kacs which is controversial in part because of its collaboration with genetic engineers as in his most famous work GFP Bunny which produced a glowinthedark rabbit named Alba may nevertheless engage in a fundamentally posthumanist project in its xxxi introduction deft deployment and exposure of certain habits of visuality and rep resentationalism associated as W J T Mitchell and Luhmann argue with the spectatorsubject of humanismhabits that Kacs choice of medium and method is calculated to unsettle Chapter 7 continues the investigation of the relationship between visuality and posthumanism on the terrain of photography and film but adds to it the relationship between sound and voice specifically in Lars von Triers brilliant and to some infuriating film Dancer in the Dark Drawing on work by Stanley Cavell Catherine Clément Kaja Silverman Judith Butler Slavoj Žižek Derrida and others I attempt to draw out the ethical stakes of how the film stages a certain drama of prosthetic subjectivity and of what Žižek calls the act as feminine in the story of the main character Selma played brilliantly by the pop phe nom Björka story that begins with her impending blindness and ends with her hanging for the crime of murder In the process I try to dem onstrate how both Cavells skepticism and Žižeks psychoanalysis bril liant as they are in their local insights remain fundamentally within the purview of a humanism that von Triers film both mobilizes as fantasy and throws into question in its filmic practice As Luhmann might put it Dancer in the Darks relationship to posthumanism is not just thematic in the relationship between Selmas encroaching blindness and how it reconfigures the sightsound relationship for the human but also op erational in its handling of the medium of film itself Luhmanns work is especially apt for framing our understanding of the architectural projects discussed in chapter 8 because many of them selfconsciously mobilize the discourse of emergence autopoiesis and selforganizing systems that has become an increasingly central feature in landscape architecture in particular That discourse asks us to reconceive the relationship between nature and culture as a sys temenvironment relationship in which neither term is given as such and both are a product of cospecification as they emerge from specific practices of articulation Among the distinguished group of finalists for Torontos Downsview Park competition the winning entry Tree City by Rem Koolhaas and Bruce Mau is remarkable for its bold re fusal of the realm officially known as architecture there are no built structures in the project and its antirepresentationalist attempt to dis place the compositional logic endemic to the problem of the urban introduction xxxii parka logic that is after all quite at odds with the conceptual thrust of selforganizing systems and autopoiesis invoked by all the entries To accomplish its task Tree City engages in a kind of dematerialization of the architectural medium in which time not spaceand certainly not built spacebecomes the constitutive medium A similar logic of dematerialization is at work in Diller  Scofidios Blur projecta manufactured cloud hovering over a lakeand it is one that raises fundamental questions of form and meaning in art that Luhmanns work will help us answer namely how in the medium of architec ture no less can the weakening even the refusal of form in the tra ditional sense constitute precisely a works boldest formal statement To answer that question we need to understand that art as a social system has a unique relationship to the difference between perception and communication discussed in our opening chapter The work of art Luhmann argues copresents that difference and reenters it in service of its own construction of meaning integrating what is in principle incommunicablenamely perceptioninto the communi cation network of society41 This is what allows art to have a privileged relationship to what has traditionally been called the ineffable and the sublime That paradoxical observability of the unobservable the commu nicability of the incommunicablethe fact that as Luhmann puts it the activity of distinguishing and indicating that goes on in the world conceals the world42ought to sound familiar to students of romanti cism and in particular to students of Stanley Cavells reading of philo sophical skepticism as a framework for understanding the subject of chapter 9 Ralph Waldo Emerson For Cavell skepticism names the problem deriving canonically from Kants encounter with the Ding an sich of the evanescence and lubricity of all objects as Emerson puts it which lets them slip through our fingers when we clutch hardest To Cavells brilliant rereading of Emerson I want to add Luhmanns reading of romanticism as a reaction to modernity as a phenomenon of functional differentiation because it helps us see that Emerson more than any other philosopher of his day or one might argue of any day puts particular pressure on the paradoxical dynamics of ob servation as theorized by Luhmann as in Emersons proclamation in Nature of 1836 I am nothing I see all Cavells reading of Emerson xxxiii introduction in light of philosophical skepticism thus inaugurates a project that we will need Luhmanns systems theory to complete If Cavell helps us to understand how Emerson reinvents philosophy by continuing to do philosophy after philosophy is in a very real sense impossible then Luhmann helps us articulate more precisely how that task must be come a posthumanist one how it is precisely at his most paradoxical and illogical that Emerson is at his most systematic and rigorous in obeying a quite different logic a logic inaugurated by modernity as functional differentiation and its unavoidable epistemological fallout Emersons especially rigorous form of romanticism and his en gagement of the problem of observation as theorized by Luhmann form an invaluable background for chapter 10 which engages the work of the twentiethcentury poet perhaps most associated with the Emersonian legacy Wallace Stevens Here however I am less con cerned with an authorial study than with extending Luhmanns inves tigations of the problems of form and meaning encountered in the pre vious two chapters into the realm of poetic form specifically As with my reading of Emerson my aim here is to show that Luhmanns theory of art in relation to the paradoxical dynamics of observation provides us with the tools to move beyond the critical impasses that have char acterized vague discussions of Stevenss romantic modernism Like Emersons philosophy Stevenss poetry insists on our not turning away from paradoxical selfreference it both calls for an encounter with things exactly as they are and proclaims that what I saw  Or heard or felt came not but from myself43 It is not just in paradox but in the systematicity with which it is deployed that we may identify the rigor of Stevenss poetry Far from a nonserious or imaginative engage ment of the problem Stevenss work uses form in Luhmanns sense to stage and more importantly to make productive the central paradox of meaning after the turn to functional differentiation that selfreference mind imagination or spirit in the thematics of romanticism and hetero reference reality world nature are themselves both products of self reference Luhmanns work helps us to see that this is not however simply an updated form of philosophical idealism of the sort derived from Kant It also helps us understand a fact we encountered in chap ter 8 that form does not involve the material or perceptual substrate of the artwork here in the conspicuous absence in much of Stevenss introduction xxxiv poetry of the prosodic features typically associated with poetic form but is rather a matter of the recursive selfreference of arts communi cation what Luhmann calls arts overcoming of its own contingency Form is not that is the externalization of a subjective interiority or a consciousness and it is in that precise sense posthumanist In the final chapter I return to questions that animate the middle part of the bookquestions of sound voice music and visuality I re visit the work of Jacques Derrida to parse the relationship between analog and digital media on the site of David Byrne and Brian Enos collaboration both musical and artistic around their remarkable re cord My Life in the Bush of Ghosts 1981 The uncanny effect of that record on almost everyone who hears it in my experience has to do in no small part with its use of found vocal materials drawn from a range of I THEORIES DISCIPLINES ETHICS This page intentionally left blank Meaning and Event or Systems Theory and The Reconstruction of Deconstruction As I said humans cant communicate niklas luhmann How Can the Mind Participate in Communication The reception of systems theory in the United Statesand in North America generallyover the past decade and more has been vexatious at best In a professional academic landscape in which most critics and theorists pride themselves on moving easily and syncreti cally between theoretical approaches that at an earlier moment were thought of more as warring factions systems theory remains odd man out When it is understood at all it is routinely greeted with re actions ranging from suspicion to outright anger Critics who think of their work rightly or wrongly as a component of a broader politi cal projectat least in the last instance to borrow Louis Althussers wellknown caveatoften view systems theory as just a grim techno cratic functionalism or a thinly disguised apology for the status quo a kind of barely camouflaged social Darwinism In this view systems theoryin either its firstorder Norbert Wiener version or its second order Niklas Luhmann retoolinggets assimilated to the larger context of postWorld War II societys obsession with management commandandcontrol apparatuses informatic reproduction homeo stasis and the like rightly criticized by theorists like Donna Haraway in her important essay The Biological Enterprise Sex Mind and Profit from Human Engineering to Sociobiology1 Systems theory in stead of being invited to the party reserved for chaos and complexity theory and their interest in the unpredictability creativity and emer gence of complex nonlinear dynamics ends up dancing with Richard Dawkinss The Selfish Gene Still others level more general charges meaning and event familiar from the shopworn discourse of antitheory and lament sys tems theorys excessive abstraction its lack of attention to social and historical texture and its blind ambition to assimilate everything in its purview as grist for its universalizing mill If these charges sound familiar they ought to because they are an uncanny echo of the sorts of things that we all remember being said about deconstruction and specifically about the work of Jacques Derrida when it came ashore in North America in the 1970s Derridas Speech and Phenomena appeared in translation in 1973 followed in rapid succession by Of Grammatology in English in 1976 and Writing and Difference in 1978 Of course we all got over it and the irony need hardly be remarked but Ill remark it anyway that it is difficult to find anyone who has had much success in the profession of literary and cultural studies in North America who did not cut his or her teeth on just these texts and whose deployment of lessons learned from them in his or her own work is not more or less automatic and unconscious though that has changed some over the past decade with the hege mony of certain modes of historicism in which the antitheory compo nent is especially virulenta question I will revisit in some detail in chapter 4 The reasons for system theorys chilly reception in the United States are complicated and Im not going to investigate them in any detail here but Ill at least offer a couple of brief speculations One set of reasons not to be underestimated is disciplinary and institutional First as many of us remember deconstruction in Americaa time capsule phrase if ever there was onemade its way into universities mainly via comparative literature departments and if you think that was a precarious foothold consider that the major practitioner of sys tems theory Luhmann has entered the US academy primarily by way of German departments or their equivalent fractions in larger compara tive literature and language departments mainly under the rubric of German intellectual history Here the work of scholars such as David Wellbery William Rasch and Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht is exemplary But over the past decade many American universities have downsized or eliminated their German departments and it is hard for me to think of any more endangered place to be in the humanities in the United States over the past ten years with the possible exception of classics Related to this question of institutional foothold is another dif ferent deficit the absence of a nationally disseminated journal that is tethered to the theoretical model Diacritics published out of the Comparative Literature Department at Cornell University became something like the house journal for deconstruction in the 1970s and 1980s but the Stanford Literature Review which has done more than any single US journal to consistently publish work in systems theory is not Diacritics A few special issues of other wellknown journals have been devoted to systems theory and Luhmanns workTheory Culture and Society published by Sage in Great Britain though widely available in the United States MLN New German Critique and one and a half issues of Cultural Critique titled The Politics of Systems and Environmentsbut nothing that has the kind of ongoing rela tionship to systems theory that Representations did and does for New Historicism Moreover systems theory has had to brook an even greater degree of disciplinary dissonance where the establishing texts of deconstruction were quite identifiably within the purview of phi losophy and often of literature the major texts and figures of systems theory enter the humanities through the side door of science either social science and sociology with Luhmann or the life sciences in the case of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela or the inter face of firstorder cybernetic computer science with neurology in the case of Heinz von Foerster Finally there is the daunting difficulty of the theory itself whichparticularly in Luhmanns handsgives even seasoned readers of theory pause with its extraordinary abstrac tion and rigor its headon engagement with problems of paradox self reference and the like its systematically counterintuitive findings and its relative lack of creature comforts along the way for those who have signed on for the journey of what Luhmann unabashedly calls supertheory Of course here again we should probably remind our selves that it is hard to recall a major theoretical development about which something similar was not said and some of our colleagues are old enough to remember similar complaints about the technical rigor and coldbloodedness of that strange alienating scientistic approach to literary texts called gasp the New Criticism Other speculations could no doubt be offered about why systems theory in the United States has not emerged as the kind of factor in meaning and event cultural studies that it is most obviously in Germany but my main point is not to analyze those reasons further Rather it is to nudge the reception of systems theory in a different direction by strategi cally bringing out some of its more deconstructive characteristics2 Indeed I hope to make clear to skeptics that much of what they like about deconstruction is also much of what they should like about sys tems theory because systems theory in its contemporary articulation far from conforming to the stereotypes prepared for it in the US academymay well be read to borrow Dirk Baeckers formulation as an attempt to do away with any usual notion of system the theory in a way being the deconstruction of its central term3 To take only one example let us revisit the epigraph with which I began On the one hand the dominant hand Luhmanns conten tion that humans cant communicate seems not just counterintuitive but flatly wrong in fact as a colleague mentioned to me recently at a conference it seems insulting And yet as I hope will be clear by the end of my comments here Luhmanns remark rhetorically calculated no doubt to cause just such a stir makes essentially the same point about the difference between consciousness and communication that we have quite readily accepted for decades now as gospel from Derrida namely his deconstruction of the autoaffection of the voice aspresence and of the valorizing of speech as an index of the self presence of consciousness to itself  over writing a recursive domain of iterative communication that is properly understood fundamen tally ahuman or even antihuman I will return to the ethical implica tions around this question of the metaphysical voice in chapter 6 Similarly I will explore in more detail in the next chapter Derridas insistence that it is just this sort of radical separation of what Luhmann calls psychic and social systems that will lead him to reject the notion of the signifier as in Lacans formulation of the subject of the signifier which seems at first glance quite cognate to Luhmanns formulation in favor of the articulation of writing as fundamentally a structured dynamics of the trace Equally important for my purposes in this book as we will see in the next three chapters is that this trace structure of communication extends beyond the human to nonhuman animals and indeed exceeds as we are about to see the boundary between the liv ing and the mechanical or technical come as no surprise because Derrida himself announces the conver gence in his own terms in early formative texts such as Of Gramma tology whose first chapter The End of the Book and the Beginning of Writing begins with a section entitled The Program There Derrida argues that the entire field covered by the cybernetic program will be the field of writing but writing understood in terms of the grammè or the grapheme a writing that would name as its fundamental unit an element without simplicitywhich is to say an element of irre ducible complexity specifically as systems theory uses the term And a temporalized complexity at that for as Derrida writes cybernetics is itself intelligible only in terms of a history of the possibilities of the trace as the unity of a double movement of protention and retention4 Derridas claim put forth as it was in the late 1960s may seem even now a radical one but in fact it was lodged against the back drop of an entire revolution in the sciences that had already taken such models as axiomatic In fact the first chapter of the 1965 Nobel Prize winner Francois Jacobs remarkably influential The Logic of Life is also called The Programme There Jacob reminds us that hered ity is described today in terms of information messages and code What this meansand this is clearly related to Derridas early work on both Husserl and Saussureis that the intention of a psyche has been replaced by the translation of a message The living being does indeed represent the execution of a plan but not one conceived in any mind5 Derrida would add to this however the point he presses in Of Grammatology If the theory of cybernetics is by itself to oust all metaphysical conceptsincluding the concepts of soul of life of value of choice of memorywhich until recently served to separate the machine from man it must conserve the notion of writing trace grammè written mark or grapheme until its own historicometaphysical character is exposed6 As an example of such character interestingly enough Derrida cites in a footnote not Jacob but the firstgeneration systems theorist Norbert Wiener who while abandoning semantics and the opposition judged by him as too crude and too general between animate and inanimate meaning and event etc nevertheless continues to use expressions like organs of sense motor organs etc to qualify the parts of the machine 324n3 Part of what I will be arguing in what follows is that Luhmanns handling of systems theory accomplishes just the sort of conservation of the logic of the grammè that Derrida calls for a conservation that is crucial to any posthumanism whatsoevernot only because the movement of the programasgrammè goes far beyond the possibilities of the in tentional consciousness as the source and guarantor of meaning but also because once the notion of the program is invoked one no longer has recourse to the concepts that habitually serve to distinguish man from other living beings instinct and intelligence absence or presence of speech of society of economy etc etc 84 As I have suggested elsewhere this crosstalk between postwar science and what would come to be called theory is not limited to Derrida and Wiener Indeed perhaps the most profound backstory of all in contemporary thought is the ongoing if episodic influence of such new scientific discourses on thinkers who would emerge in the 1950s and 1960s to redefine the very landscape of the humanities and social sciences think here of Foucaults interest in Jacob and Canguilhem Lacans in cybernetics Lyotards in chaos and catastrophe theory and so on7 My aim at the moment however is not to make that histori cal argument Nor is it just to play up the deconstructive aspects of systems theory nor even to suggest as I have been that the largely kneejerk reactions to systems theory in the United States have been misplaced or at least visàvis the reception of deconstruction rather ungenerously placed Rather my emphasis here will on the usefulness of viewing secondorder systems theory as to use Luhmanns characterization the reconstruction of deconstruction8 That project hinges on sys tems theorys extraordinarily rigorous and detailed account of the fundamental dynamics and complexities of meaning that subtend the reproduction and interpenetration of psychic and social systems And systems theory then takes the additional step of linking those dynam ics to their biological social and historical conditions of emergence and transformation a crucial move that as Gunther Teubner has ar gued deconstruction either cannot or will not undertake It is certainly the case that Derridas later work has been intensely and increasingly engaged with the question of social institutions in all their formsthe law the university the question of rights the institution of property and so onand the logics that ground and sustain their reproduction But though he has raised such questionsworried them might be a bet ter termwith a degree of nuance and suppleness perhaps unmatched in contemporary theory and philosophy Derrida has not been espe cially interested in articulating the relationship between the theoreti cal complexities of those dynamics and the historical and sociological conditions of their emergenceconditions that he suggests impel such thinking at this very moment9 Whether this is a failure or a prin cipled refusal on Derridas part is an interesting question and it is one I will return to later in this chapter One could cite any number of Derridas texts in this connection but the recent collection of essays Without Alibi exemplifies quite well what I mean There Derrida considers the question of what he calls a politics of the virtual of a certain delocalizing virtualization of the space of communication discussion publication archivization against the backdrop of this larger question Will we one day be able and in a single gesture to join the thinking of the event to the think ing of the machine10 Today he continues they appear to us to be antinomic    An event worthy of the name ought not so we think to give in or be reduced to repetition but rather ought above all to happen to someone some living being who is thus affected by it The machine on the contrary is destined to reproduce impassively im perceptibly without organ or organicity received commands it obeys a calculable program without affect or autoaffection 72 If we are to address the sorts of questions raised here Derrida argues now is the time for a new kind of thinking How he asks is one to reconcile on the one hand a thinking of the event which I pro pose withdrawing despite the apparent paradox from an ontology or a metaphysics of presence    and on the other hand a certain concept of machineness machinalité 136 This he rightly observes is the place of a thinking that ought to be devoted to the virtualization of the event by the machine to a virtuality that in exceeding the philosophi cal determination of the possibility of the possible    exceeds by the same token the classical opposition of the possible and the impossible 135 If one day he continues with one and the same concept these meaning and event two incompatible concepts the event and the machine were to be thought together you can bet that not only    will one have produced a new logic an unheardof conceptual form In truth against the back ground and horizon of our present possibilities this new figure would resemble a monster 73 It would be in a word posthumanist What I want to suggest of course is that systems theory in its secondorder incarnation is just such a monster one whose corner stone genetic mutation is the transfer of the concept of autopoiesis from organicity to the domain of not only psychic but also social systems systems whose fundamental elements are not people or groups but com munications and eventsand events conceptualized along the lines Derrida lays out in the previous paragraph We have already used de construction to help clarify a central point from systems theorythe separation of psychic and social systemsbut here we can return the favor and use systems theory to clarify how the thinking of the event may be in Derridas words withdrawn from an ontology or meta physics of presence11 On the one hand events constitute the fundamen tal elements of psychic and social systems in Luhmanns scheme On the other hand they occur only once and only in the briefest period nec essary for their appearance the specious present They are identified by this temporal appearance and cannot be repeated12 But precisely this suits them to be the elementary units of processes because the system itself determines the length of time during which an element is treated as a unity that cannot be further dissolved that period has a conferred not an ontological character 48 An elements unity corre sponds to no unity in the substrate it is created by the system that uses them through their connectivity 215 accordingly Luhmann con tinues an adequately stable system is composed of unstable elements It owes its stability to itself not to its elements its constructs itself upon a foundation that is entirely not there and this is precisely the sense in which it is autopoietic 48 And here as much as anywhere we get a specific sense of how systems theory thinks Derridas event and machine all at once as a deconstructive enfolding of the difference between the systems iterative selfreference and the fleeting temporality of the event from the outsidea difference that not only serves as the very basis for the systems autopoiesis but also clarifies the fact as Dietrich Schwanitz puts it that systems theory is anything but mechanistic13 As for Derridas partyou will have already guessed by my use of the term iterative a moment agowe know what his version of this monstrosity of the eventmachine looks like it looks like écriture archéwriting as différance as grammè and as trace For our purposes it is all the more interesting then that in contrast to his notion of writing Derrida has interrogated the concept of communication in a variety of contexts and nowhere more forcefully perhaps than in his essay Signature Event Context and its related documents collected in Limited Inc There he argues that his concept of writing can no longer be comprehensible in terms of communication at least in the limited sense of a transmission of meaning Inversely it is within the general domain of writing defined in this way that the effects of semantic communication can be determined as effects that are particular sec ondary inscribed and supplementary14 The full resonance of this last assertion in relation to the dynam ics of meaning in systems theory will become clear in a moment but for now we need to note as well that the difference between writing in Derridas sense and communication as he defines it is marked by radi cally different relations to the question of the subjectand here indeed we encounter from the point of view of humanism part of its mon strosity As Derrida writes Imagine a writing whose code would be so idiomatic as to be established and known as a secret cipher by only two subjectsand subjects here is given in quotation marks Could we maintain that following the death of the receiver or even of both partners the mark left by one of them is still a writing Yes to the extent to that organized by a code even an unknown and non linguistic one it is constituted in its identity as a mark by its iterability in the absence of such and such a person and hence ultimately of every empirically determined subject    The possibility of repeating and thus of identifying the marks is implicit in every code making it into a network une grille that is communicable transmittable decipherable iterable for a third and hence for every possible user in general To be what it is all writing must therefore be capable of functioning in the radical absence of every empirically determined receiver in general15 Herein lies the radically posthumanist dimension of writingas difference the subjectin a process nearly proverbial for contempo rary thought from Derrida to Lacanonly comes to be by conforming meaning and event to a strictly diacritical system of differences effects which do not find their cause in a subject or a substance in a thing in general a being that is somewhere present thereby eluding the play of difference16 Moreover those effects and relations are at once material bodily ex ternal institutional technological and historicalthey exist in all the specificity and heterogeneity of what Derrida calls their iteration Hence Derrida argues that this pure difference which constitutes the selfpresence of the living present introduces into selfpresence from the beginning all the impurity putatively excluded from it The living present springs forth out of its nonidentity with itself and from the possibility of a retentional trace It is always already a trace And what this means in turn is that the trace is the intimate relation of the liv ing present to its outside the opening to exteriority in general17 From the point of view of the philosophical tradition that Derrida is concerned to deconstruct such will be the corrupting and con taminating work the monstrosity if you will of iterability which entails the necessity of thinking at once both the rule and the event concept and singularity as such it marks the essential and ideal limit of all pure idealization not as the concept of nonideality as ideal itys pure other but as the impossibility or at the least the provisional ity of idealization as such18 Like the undecidability that it unavoid ably generatesand this will lead us to the final question we want to raiseiterability remains heterogeneous to rather than simply op posed to the order of the ideal the calculable the pure and so on As such it names a form of ethical responsibility that entails vigilant attention to each specific interfolded iteration of rule and event to this particular undecidable that opens the field of decision or decid ability 116 one that is always a determinate oscillation between pos sibilities that takes place in strictly defined situations for example discursivesyntactical or rhetoricalbut also political ethical etc They are pragmatically determined 148 Exactly what the force and scope of this last assertionprag matically determined and in strictly defined situationsare for Derrida is a question that goes directly to Teubners concerns already touched on earlier and it is one to which I will return later in this chapter and the book particularly in chapter 3 For now however I simply want to make the point that this picture of writing in the Derridean sense and the restructuring of the question of the subject that it pulls in its wake does not mark a difference between Derridas écriture and the concept of communication in systems theory rather it is precisely what illuminates their convergence When Derrida uses the term communication in Limited Inc what he really has in mind is the model of communication mobilized by firstgeneration systems theory That model like the speech act theory of Austin deconstructed in Limited Inc seems but only seems as it turns out to rightly refer the question of meaning to its external formal dynamics rather than to ontology intentionality and so on Of course it is this very bag gage attached to the term communication that Luhmanns work like Derridas is dead set on rejecting In fact Communication and Action the chapter in Social Systems that makes this clearest explic itly meaning and event that are already ensconced in textual and institutional form and then asks how the subversion of those structures by their own elements can be revealed21 For Derrida contingency temporality the event noise and so on constitute the eruptive and finally irrepressible difference at the heart of any logos or law a difference whose unavoidability and un masterability deconstruction aims to bring to light and sustain For systems theory however this radical heterogeneity is handled within an adaptive and operational framework as a fundamental evolution ary problem for autopoietic systems that have to reproduce themselves in the face of this overwhelming difference22 Because of this reversal of orientation the descriptions offered by systems theory autopoietic systems that can reduce environmental difference and complexity will continue to exist have been misunderstood as prescriptions such sys tems should exist and difference and complexity are negative values But of course systems theory doesnt desire the reduction of differ ence and complexity indeed Luhmann would be the first to insist that such would constitute a category mistake if ever there was one it only describes how difference and complexity have to be handled by sys tems that hope to continue their autopoiesis Systems theory in other words does not occlude deny or other wise devalue difference but rather begins with differencenamely the cornerstone postulate of the difference between system and envi ronment and the corollary assumption that the environment of any system is always already of overwhelmingly greater complexity than the system itself Since it is obviously impossible for any system to es tablish pointforpoint correspondences between itself and its environ ment systems thus handle the problem of overwhelming environmen tal complexity by reducing it in terms of the selectivity made available by the systems selfreferential code as Luhmann puts it The systems inferiority in complexity must be counterbalanced by strategies of se lection Complexity in this sense he continues means being forced to select and thus in his winning formulation only complexity can reduce complexity23 Under pressure to adapt to a complex and chang ing environment systems increase their selectivitythey make their environmental filters more finely woven if you likeby building up their own internal complexity by means of selfreferential closure and the reentry of the systemenvironment distinction within the system itself in a process of internal differentiation24 For example the difference between the legal system and its en vironment is reintroduced in the legal system itself which now serves as the environment for the various subsystems of the law and the same could be said within the educational system about the vari ous academic disciplines and subdisciplines and so on25 This self referential closure however does not indicate solipsism idealism or isolation but is instead crucial to understanding a fundamental prin ciple I will return to throughout these pages the principle of what I call openness from closure It does not contradict the systems open ness to the environment Instead in the selfreferential mode of opera tion closure is a form of broadening possible environmental contacts closure increases by constituting elements more capable of being de termined the complexity of the environment that is possible for the system And this is why Luhmann writes selfreference is in itself nothing bad forbidden or to be avoided indeed it points directly to system formation because systems can become complex only if they succeed in solving this problem and thus in deparadoxicalizing themselves26 What makes such systems paradoxical in the first place is the unity of the difference between the two sides of the distinction that anchors the systems code For example the firstorder distinction be tween legal and illegal in the legal system is itself a product of the codes own selfreferencethat is to say the problem is that both sides of the distinction are instantiated by one side of the distinction namely the legal hence the tautology legal is legal But the tautological unity of this distinction may be disclosed only by a secondorder observer operating within another system and another code which must re main blind to its paradoxical distinction if it is to use that distinction to process events for the systems autopoiesis and so on and so forth The formal notation for this dynamic that Luhmann borrows from George SpencerBrowns Laws of Form will help make this clearer As Bruce Clarke summarizes it the form consists of four elements 1 the indi cation or marked state of a distinctions inside 2 the indications unmarked state or the outside of the distinction 3 the distinction itself as a unity of its marked and unmarked states and 4 a second meaning and event distinction between marked and unmarked spaces made by a second order observer which will obey the same form27 Thus What is most interesting here however is that these constitutive paradoxes far from hindering the autopoiesis of selfreferential systems in fact force their autopoiesis28 And herein this transvaluation of the paradoxes of selfreference from paralytic to productivethe lines of re lation between systems theory and deconstruction come quite clearly into view If we want to observe paradoxical communications as de framing and reframing deconstructing and reconstructing operations Luhmann writes we need a concept of meaning    as the simultaneous presentation    of actuality and possibility    The distinction actualpossible is a form that reenters itself On one side of the distinction the actual the distinction actualpossible reappears it is copied into itself    If we observe such a reentry we see a paradox The reentering distinction is the same and it is not the same But the paradox does not prevent the operations of the system On the contrary it is the condition of their possibility29 This is so Luhmann writes because the totality of the socalled present element    is related to something other than itself thereby keeping within itself the mark of the past element while at the same time being vitiated by the mark of its relation to the future element thus constituting what is called the present by means of this very relation to what it is not31 Or as Luhmann puts it One could say that meaning equips an actual experience or action with redundant possibilitiesnamely what was selected the actual and what could have been the possibleand this is crucial for any systems ability to respond to environmental complexity by building up its own complex ity via the form of meaning This is what Luhmann means when he says that this formal requirement refers meaning to the problem of complexity32 The genesis and reproduction of meaning presupposes an infrastructure in reality that constantly changes its states he writes Meaning then ex tracts differences which only as differences have meaning from this substructure to enable a differenceoriented processing of information On all meaning therefore are imposed a temporalized complexity and the compulsion to a constant shifting of actuality without mean ing itself vibrating in tune with that substructure 63 From an adap tive and evolutionary point of view then selfreference and the form of meaning do not indicate solipsism Quite the contrary As Luhmann points out it is unproductive for meanings to circulate as mere self referentiality or in shortcircuited tautologies    One can think This rose is a rose is a rose is a rose But this use of a recursive path is pro ductive only if it makes itself dependent on specific conditions and does not always ensue 61 And herein lies the difference for Luhmann between meaning and information one that recalls Derridas emphasis in Limited Inc on the specific pragmatics of iterability Luhmann contin ues A piece of information that is repeated is no longer information It retains its meaning in the repetition but loses its value as information One reads in the paper that the deutsche mark has risen in value If one reads this a second time in another paper this activity no longer has value as information    although structurally it presents the same selection Something can be meaningful in other words but have no informational value or to put it another wayone that will bear di rectly on my discussion of form and poetry in chapter 10form and formalism are only part of the story when it comes to meaning meaning and event One thus begins not with identity but with differencewith two differences in fact the difference inherent in every experience between what is actually given and what can possibly result from it that is given in the internal form of meaning itself and the difference between meaning and information that is forced on the system by environmental complexity and temporality Only thus can one give accidents informational value and thereby construct order because information is nothing more than an event that brings about a con nection between differencesa difference that makes a difference Therefore we encounter the decomposition of meaning per se the de tautologization of meanings selfreference forced on the system by the adaptive pressure of the environment of the outside world 75 This is whycontrary to the view of systems theory as solipsistic im perialistic and so onLuhmann insists that the difference between meaning and world is formed for this process of the continual self determination of meaning as the difference between order and per turbation between information and noise Both are and both remain necessary The unity of the difference is and remains the basis for op eration This cannot be emphasized strongly enough A preference for mean ing over world for order over perturbation for information over noise is only a preference It does not enable one to dispense with the contrary 83 italics mine In the form of meaning then we find that systems increase their contacts with their environments paradoxically by virtualizing them Meaning is the continual actualization of potentialities Luhmann writes but because meaning can be meaning only as the difference between what is actual at any given moment and a horizon of possibilities every actualization always also leads to a virtualization of the potentialities that could be connected up with it The instability of meaning resides in the untenability of its core of actuality the ability to restabilize is provided by the fact that everything actual has meaning only within a horizon of possibilities    that can and must be selected as the next actuality    Thus one can treat the difference between actual ity and possibility in terms of temporal displacement and thereby pro cess indications of possibility with every new actuality Meaning is the unity of actualization and virtualization of reactualization and revirtualization as a selfpropelling process 65 This virtualization via meaning is an extraordinarily powerful evo lutionary dynamic and it is put to good use by both psychic and social systems Indeed Luhmann insists Not all systems process complex ity and selfreference in the form of meaningand here one could think of various biological systems33but for those that do it is the only possibility Meaning becomes for them the form of the world and consequently overlaps the difference between system and envi ronment 61 Or as Luhmann sometimes characterizes itin a for mulation resonant not only with Derridas essays such as Structure Sign and Play but also with Emersons philosophy and the core pre occupations of romanticismThe relationship between meaning and world can also be described with the concept of decentering As mean ing the world is accessible everywhere in every situation in any de tail which is to say that the world is indicated in all meaning To that state of affairs corresponds an acentric world concept 70 and hence the closure of the selfreferential order is synonymous here with the infinite openness of the world 62 This coimplication of psychic and social systems via the formal dynamics of meaning combined with Luhmanns simultaneous insis tence on the strict separation of psychic and social systems as discrete autopoietic entities marks one of systems theorys most difficult and counterintuitive featuresbut also one of its most powerful innova tions In a formulation as matteroffact as it is beguiling Luhmann writes Humans cannot communicate not even their brains can com municate not even their conscious minds can communicate Only communication can communicate34 What we experience as our own mind operates as an isolated autopoietic system he points out and in fact that isolation is an indispensable condition of its possibility 170 There is no conscious link between one mind and another nor is there any operational unity of more than one mind as a systemall of which Luhmann argues is essentially taken for granted at this point by contemporary neurophysiology 170 Indeed he asks how could any psychic system maintain its own functions if it shared its unity with other minds How could I deliver a lecture if I shared the momentto moment ebb and flow of psychic activity of even one other conscious ness in the room In this sense communication Luhmann writes operates with an unspecific reference to the participating state of meaning and event mind it is especially unspecific as to perception It cannot copy states of mind cannot imitate them cannot represent them This is the basis for the possibility of communications building up a complexity of its own 178 Our intuitions of course would seem to suggest otherwise and this is so precisely because psychic systems and social systems have coevolved each serving as the environment for the other and this has led to a common achievement employed by psychic as well as social systems35 That achievement of course is meaning Meaning Luhmann writes is the true substance of this emergent evolution ary level It is therefore false or more gently it is falsely chosen an thropocentrism to assign the psychic    ontological priority over the social It is impossible to find a supporting substance for meaning Meaning supports itself in that it enables its own selfreferential repro duction And only the forms of this reproduction differentiate psychic and so cial structuresnamely whether consciousness in the case of psychic systems or communication social systems is chosen as the form of operation 98 Here as I have already suggested we find Luhmanns answer to Derridas critique of the autoaffection of the voice and of consciousness as presence in Speech and Phenomena Of Grammatology and elsewhere of the fallacy that writing or communication could be referred for its efficacy as a representation to an ontic substrate of consciousness and the psychic system whereas in fact it is the onto logically unsupported urdynamic of writing Derrida or meaning Luhmann that is fundamental and allows psychic and social systems to interpenetrate And as we will see in later chapters 8 and 10 the disarticulation and interpenetration of consciousness and communica tion are crucial to how art and within that poetry engages in a par ticular form of communication that is barred to other social systems The difficulty in understanding this disarticulation of conscious ness and communication Luhmann points out in a disarmingly commonsensical moment lies in that every consciousness that tries to do so is itself a selfreferentially closed system and therefore cannot get outside of consciousness For consciousness even communication can only be conducted consciously and is invested in further possible consciousness But for communication this is not so Communication is only possible as an event that transcends the closure of consciousness as the synthesis of more than the content of just one consciousness 99 The confusing of consciousness and communication if one wants to put it that way is precisely why the concept of meaning must be employed on such a high theoretical level Meaning enables psychic and social systems to interpenetrate while protecting their autopoiesis meaning simultaneously enables consciousness to understand itself and continue to affect itself in communication and enables communication to be re ferred back to the consciousness of the participants 219 The allimportant medium that allows this interpenetration via the form of meaning to take place is you will have already guessed language But this does not mean language determines consciousness Luhmann writes psychic processes are not linguistic processes he continues nor is thought in any way internal dialogue as has been falsely maintained It lacks an internal addressee There is no second I no self in the conscious system no me visàvis an I no addi tional authority that examines all linguistically formed thoughts to see whether it will accept or reject them and whose decision conscious ness seeks to anticipate 272 Luhmanns point here no doubt takes for granted similar formulations throughout Derridas early work in Speech and Phenomena Of Grammatology and elsewhere but the empha sis in Luhmann falls rather differently on the evolutionary aspects of this disarticulation What is important for Luhmann is that one must do justice to the powerful role of language in the coevolution of psy chic and social systems while simultaneously paying attention to their autopoiesis and selfreferential closure On the one hand the evolu tion of social communication is only possible in a constantly operative link with states of consciousness which is provided by the medium of language on the other hand language transfers social complexity into psychic complexity SS 272 in a process generically referred to in contemporary theory as subjectification or subject formation36 The social system places its own complexity which has stood the test of communicative manageability at the psychic systems disposal but at the same time language and even more writing ensures for the communication system what Maturana calls the conservation of meaning and event adaptation the constant accommodation of communication to the mind They define the free space of autopoiesis within the social com munication system37 For Luhmann then language is not constitutive of either psychic or social systems but is rather a specific secondorder phenomenona type of symbolically generalized communication mediathat those systems use in the services of the firstorder processes of meaning for maintaining their own autopoiesis while at the same time enabling them to interpenetrate and use each others complexity to mutual benefit38 From Luhmanns point of view language is not just a means of communication because it functions in psychic systems without communication in the strict sense of having to take place 94 but at the same time communication is also possible without language and may take place in all sorts of nonlinguistic ways perhaps through laughing through questioning looks through dress and so on 150 In fact what is fundamental about communication for Luhmann is not its disrelation to language but that it is a synthesis of three selec tions 147 information the content if you like to be communicated utterance the specific pragmatic communicative event or behavior selected to communicate information and understanding a receivers processing of the difference between information and utterance that completes the communicative act 14042 147 151 Again the issue is not just difference all forms of meaning of which communication is a specific instance operate by means of difference the issue is whether to remember Gregory Batesons phrase an utterance is a difference that makes a difference in terms of the systems autopoiesis Or as Luhmann puts it difference as such begins to work if and insofar as it can be treated as information in selfreferential systems 40 To recall Luhmanns earlier example of the value of the deutsche mark an utter ance once repeated may retain the same form as meaning but lose its status as information it retains the same form but has lost its capacity to select the systems states 40not because its form has changed but because the state of the system has This fact draws our attention in turn to what Derrida in Limited Inc calls the specific pragmatically determined nature of any instance of undecidability the emphasis on which would seem to run counter to Luhmanns assertion that com munication is realized if and to the extent that understanding comes about 147 Here again however Derrida and Luhmann converge on the same point from opposite directions while Derrida emphasizes the final undecidability of any signifying instance Luhmann stresses that even so systems must decide they must selectively process the differ ence between information and utterance if they are to achieve adaptive resonance with their environments Thus underneath this apparent divergence is a shared emphasisagainst relativism and anything goes reflexivityon the determinate specificity of the signifying or communicative instance that must be negotiated which is precisely why in Limited Inc Derrida rejects the term indeterminacy because it occludes an understanding of the determinate oscillation between pos sibilities for example of meaning but also of acts39 In Luhmann as in Derrida writing takes center stage as the paradigm of communication but only because it exemplifies a deeper trace structure the grammè of the program as it were of meaning a paradigm whose essential logic is for Luhmann only intensified by the sorts of later technical developments beginning with printing in which we have already seen Derrida himself keenly interested in texts like Without Alibi and Archive Fever In this light the problem with oral speech as Luhmann describes it is that it threatens to collapse the difference between information and utterance performatively subordi nating information to utterance and presuming their simultaneity leaving literally no time for doubt as Luhmann puts it40in precisely the manner analyzed in Derridas early critique of the subordination of writing to speaking But if the value of language is that it is the medium that increases the understandability of communication be yond the sphere of perception 160 then writing is its full realization Only writing Luhmann observes enforces the clear distinction between information and utterance and only writing and printing suggest communicative processes that react not to the unity of but to the difference between utterance and information    Writing and printing enforce an experience of the difference that constitutes com munication they are in this precise sense more communicative forms of communication 16263 Language then may be a medium distinguished by the use of signsone that is capable of extending the repertoire of understand able communication almost indefinitely in practice an achievement meaning and event whose significance can hardly be overestimated But it rests however on functional specification Therefore one must also keep its boundaries in view 160 For Luhmannand this is something like the nega tive image or reverse aspect of Derridas early reading of Saussure spe cifically his drawing out the full implications of Saussures contention that language is a diacritical system that operates without positive termsto subsume the dynamics of meaning under the theory of the sign is to ignore what he calls the basal recursive selfreference that forms the context in which all signs are determined 71 Hence the concept of the symbolic generalization of meanings selfreference replaces the concept of the sign that until now has dominated the theoretical tradition 94 And it also provides an important bridge between Derridas contention that the trace structure of writingcom munication is not limited to the domain of the human and the lin guistic alonea contention that Luhmanns work allows us to situate within a coevolutionary account of the relations between meaning communication language and the forms of complexity they make possible in psychic and social systems For Luhmann whether or not to understand Derrida precisely in terms of the theoretical tradition of the sign has been a matter of some uncertaintyan uncertainty that mirrors to a large extent broader disagreements in theory and philosophy about how Derrida is to be read and whether moreover the same understanding applies to his earlier versus later work41 At certain times Luhmann suggests a high degree of translatability between the two theories while at others he is concerned to keep his distance42 But my point here is not to rehearse these differences much less to suggest which understanding of Derrida is right nor is it to further systematize the relationship between Luhmann and Derrida along the lines already carried out quite ably by critics such as Dietrich Schwanitz David Wellbery Drucilla Cornell Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht and others Rather my point is to suggest that if systems theory needs deconstruction in the sense I touched on at the outset then deconstruction also needs systems theory to help carry out work toward which it has in comparison only gestured This complementarity rests as I have been arguing on two fun damental disarticulations in Luhmann that are at the core of Derridas work as well the disarticulation of psychic and social systems and on an even more fundamental level the disarticulation of the formal dynamics of meaning from language per se In my viewand I will develop this claim in detail over a range of contexts in the next three chaptersit is from this double disarticulation that the ethical and po litical ambitions of deconstruction derive Those ambitionsand how they are motivated by a certain set of theoretical commitmentsare aptly expressed by Derrida at moments like this one in the interview Eating Well to which I will have occasion to return more than once during these pages If one reinscribes language in a network of possibilities that do not merely encompass it but mark it irreducibly from the inside everything changes I am thinking in particular of the mark in general of the trace of iterability of différance These possibilities or necessities without which there would be no language are themselves not only human    And what I am proposing here should allow us to take into account sci entific knowledge about the complexity of animal languages genetic coding all forms of marking within which socalled human language as original as it might be does not allow us to cut once and for all where we would in general like to cut43 At such moments Derrida unfolds the implications of the point he first made for US audiences in Of Grammatology that the form and force of différance the grammè and the trace indicates a recursive it erative dynamics of meaning that exceeds the rather tidy purview of human linguisticality alone As Derrida puts it in Of Grammatology In all senses of the word writing thus comprehends language 7 And it is on the strength of that theoretical commitment that the ethical issues involvedin this particular case issues related to what is popularly known as animal rightsarise Similarly in a remarkable late essay on Lacans rendering of the humananimal divide visàvis the subject of the signifier which I ex plore in some detail in the next chapter the ethical question of our ob ligations to nonhuman beings is generated by a theoretical articulation of the force of the trace versus the Lacanian signifier that pushes Derridas thought very much in the direction of Luhmanns work on the dynamics of meaning in autopoietic systems As Derrida puts it there It is difficult to reserve as Lacan does the differentiality of signs meaning and event for human language only as opposed to animal coding What he at tributes to signs that in a language understood as belonging to the human order take on their value from their relations to each other and so on and not just from the fixed correlation between signs and reality can and must be accorded to any code animal or human44 Not only do such passages make clear that Derrida is offering us not a theory of language nor even one of writing but a far more ambitious and thoroughly posthumanist account of the paradoxi cal and deconstructive dynamics of meaning they also make it clear that the account of meaning in systems theory should be viewed as the reconstruction of deconstruction one that provides the sort of rigor ously articulated analysis toward which deconstruction only gestures philosophically but for that very reason in a sense more provocatively than the science of Luhmanns sociology This joining of forces be tween deconstruction and systems theory is crucial I would like to think not just from systems theorys vantage but from deconstructions as well Derrida points toward this necessity in an important footnote in Positions where he writes The critique of historicism in all its forms seems to me indispens able    The issue would be can one criticize historicism in the name of something other than truth and science the value of universality omnitemporality the infinity of value etc and what happens to sci ence when the metaphysical value of truth has been put into question etc How are the effects of science and of truth to be reinscribed    Finally it goes without saying that in no case is it a question of a dis course against truth or against science This is impossible and absurd as is every heated accusation on this subject And when one analyzes systematically the value of truth    it is not in order to return naively to a relativist or sceptical empiricism45 If we believe Gunther Teubner such a perspective only draws into even sharper focus the need to supplement deconstruction with sys tems theory whose explanatory force resides not only in a renovation of science that enables it to take account of selfreference and the mani fold challenges of constructivism but also in its ability to link these epistemological innovations to the historical emergence and specificity of particular social forms Moreover Teubner suggests systems theory thus enables us to understand a crucial fact about social and political ef fectivity that in his view is lost onor at least lost indeconstruction that the disclosure of paradox does not in itself threaten the autopoie sis of social systems a point that in turn bears on the putative politi cal force of deconstructions philosophical intervention As Teubner puts itand this would I think actually amount to taking seriously Derridas insistence on the specific pragmatically determined char acter of all instances of iteration and undecidability now writ large Derridas nightmare is that it is the secret of autopoiesis that social systems are no longer threat ened by the paradoxes of their deconstructive reading Autopoietic selfreproduction means that in routine operations they are constantly deparadoxifying their foundational paradox Thus they are capable of deconstructing deconstruction of course not in the sense that they can exclude it on a longterm basis but in the sense that they shift dis place disseminate historicize deconstruction itself which drastically changes the conditions of its possibility46 What this suggests for Teubner is that a deconstruction that took ac count of the foundational paradoxes of emerging social systems would need to become historical especially to recognize its own trans formations While the basic structures of the paradox remain the same social processes of their invisibilization and the threatening moments of their reemergence depend on historical contingencies    The dis tinctions which are used for deparadoxification he continues are dependent on historicalsocietal conditions of plausibility of accept ability are contingent on binding knowledge in particular societies47 Now one might well argue that Derridas workparticularly his later investigations of questions of justice in relation to law rights and so on both in his own work and in that of his interlocutorsis quite cognizant of this fact and indeed does what it does precisely to con front such systems of binding knowledge with internal paradoxes and contradictions to which they must respond But my larger point here is that the ahistorical asociological character of deconstruction is not at all obviously a failure per se on Derridas part as Teubner would have it indeed it might well be viewed from the vantage Derrida voices above on the effects of truth as a resolutely philosophical meaning and event refusal Derridas rejoinder to Teubner would no doubt be that systems theoryeven on Luhmanns termscannot have its science and eat it too This is so because as Luhmann explains the particular kind of operation that uses distinctions in the services of designation is called observation We are caught once again therefore in a circle the distinction between operation and observation appears itself as an element of observation48 Empiricism in other words must always give way to contingent and deconstructable selfreference even if we acknowledge that observation takes place always in pragmatically de termined instances of historical articulation From a Derridean point of view then the advantage that Teubner finds in Luhmanns historically oriented analysis would simply be re ferred back to an empiricism whose untenability Luhmann himself makes clear Luhmann Derrida would argue cannot maintain that there exists no observerindependent given reality49 and at the same time hold that selfreference designates the unity that an element a process or a system is for itself For itself means independent of the cut of observation by others50 If it is indeed the case that both attri butions observer attribution and object attribution are possible and that the results can therefore be considered contingent51 then this means from a Derridean point of view that the empiricism on which any historicism depends and tacitly trades is rendered permanently problematic What we are really dealing with is a specific undecid ability in the domain of meaning about what sorts of attributions are made by whom and to whom and with what particular effects Thus when Luhmann holds that the difference between selfreference in the object and selfreference in the analysis between the observed and the observing system comes to be reflected in the problem of com plexity52 what this really means in Derridean terms is comes to be reflected in the deconstructibility of the very distinctions upon which such a formulation depends Moreover Derrida would surely be the first to argue that even if such distinctions are tenable in analytical terms to take Luhmanns procedure at its word when they come to be expressed in language then our ability to draw clear boundaries between what Luhmann calls the empirical analytical and semantic dimensions of observation description is only further eroded There are then at least three orders of complexity here the autopoietic selfreference neither analytical logical nor linguistic per se of any system that makes selfreference and heteroreference a product of its own selfreferential closure a sec ond level of complexity in which some of those autopoietic systems use the form of meaning to process environmental complexity and re produce themselves and a third level of autopoietic systems that in addition to using basal selfreference and meaning also use language To acknowledge as much is from a Derridean point of view simply to take account of what we have already discussed as the contaminating force of iterabilityits monstrosity as Derrida puts itwhich miti gates against the kind of conceptual ideality that would appear to be in play in Luhmanns assumption that the empirical analytical and semantic dimensions can be so neatly separated Hence as Derrida insists in Limited Inc there can be no rigorous analogy between a sci entific theory    and a theory of language and in fact it is more scientific to take this limit if it is one into account and to treat it as a point of departure for rethinking this or that received concept of sci ence and of objectivity 118 What is involved here then to return to the text of Derridas with which we began is a certain difference between Derrida and Luhmann in relation to thinking the grammar of the event As Derrida insisted for over forty years I dont know what a grammar of the event can be except as Peggy Kamuf puts it in her introduction to Without Alibi as a reduction a cancellation of the very thing being called event53 Of course Luhmann would respond that the only way any of us are even around to declare such an inability at all is precisely on the basis of a prior reduction of environmental complexity one that provides the autopoietic conditions of possibility for raising such questions or any questions in the first place Or in Luhmanns words One must be capable of generating both continuity and discontinuity which is easier in reality than in theory54 This page intentionally left blank Language Representation and Species Cognitive Science versus Deconstruction I want to begin with a storya dog story in fact Its a story about an experiment in canine signifying abilities that appeared on June 11 2004 in my hometown newspaper the Houston Chronicle It was a re print of an article that appeared that same day in the Washington Post which in turn was about the lead article in the June 11 2004 issue of Science The Post story carried the title Common Collie or Uberpooch German Pets Vocabulary Stuns Scientists I prefer my hometown headline Dogs May Be as Smart as Owners Think They Are be cause it unwittingly directs us toward a question that I will insist is essential to addressing these kinds of issues a question that definitively separates cognitive science represented here by Daniel Dennett and deconstruction in the person here of Jacques Derrida That question is what language is and how it is related to our ideas about subjectivity consciousness and the like And that question in turn cannot be ad dressed without investigating our assumptions about what knowledge is and the kinds of knowledge we can have of ourselves and of others in this case the hardest case perhaps nonhuman others represented here by the taxonomy Canis familiaris In the most general terms then the issue that separates cognitive science and deconstruction is one that goes all the way down both epistemologically and ethically whether or not knowledgeincluding knowledge of our own subjec tivity and that of othersis representational and within that how we are to construe the relationship between epistemological and ontologi cal questions In light of these concerns the sort of intervention I am attempting here is of particular moment because Daniel Dennetts work is often re garded as a more philosophically attuned version of what is taken to be a core feature of cognitive science generally that it is thought to be in its functionalism resolutely postontological and postrepresentational language r epr esentation and species in precisely this way In this light Dennetts work presents itself as a less reductive and more nuanced version of what Terrence Deacon in The Symbolic Species characterizes as materialistic reductionism which offers in theories of mind and consciousness the dominant alternative to the Cartesian perspective It is exemplified he writes by the theoretical claim that the mind is like the sort of computa tion that takes place in electronic computers In simpler terms minds are software programs run on the hardware neural circuits of the brain The strong version of this claim or the weakest depending on your point of view is called eliminative materialism which holds that notions such as mind intention belief thought representation and so on will eventually be eliminated in discussions of cognitive pro cesses in favor or more mechanistic synonyms that refer to chemical electrical signaling processes of the brain Mentalistic terms it is sug gested are merely glosses for more complex brain processes that we at present do not understand1 With those contexts in mind let us return to the story of Rico the Uberpooch if he is one According to the various reports this nineyearold border collie living in Germany with his human com panions has recently been shown in a series of careful studies car ried out by Julia Fischer a biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig a good pedigree Id say to have a stunningly large vocabulary of about 200 words that cor respond to a collection of toys balls and the like a range compa rable to that of great apes dolphins and parrots that have undergone extensive training in language experiments2 In these experiments Rico and his owner were placed in one room and ten of the dogs toys were placed in another The dog was then instructed by his owner to retrieve two randomly selected objects named by the owner while the owner remained secluded in the separate room to avoid any chance of Clever Hans activity In forty tests Rico was accurate thirtyseven times Even more impressively in the next phase of the study the researchers put seven of his toys in the room along with one he had never seen before The owner then called out the unfamiliar name of the new toy and Rico was correct in seven out of ten tries Finally in the last phase researchers tested Rico a month later and he still remembered the name of the new toy three out of six times without language r epr esentation and species having seen it since the first testa rate of success equivalent to that of a human threeyearold3 The key finding of the study we are told is that Rico is appar ently capable of a process called fast mappingan ability to instantly assign a meaning to a new word a strategy human toddlers use to learn language at a prodigious rate and a skill thought to be exclu sively the province of humans Rico apparently can do something sci entists thought only humans could do figure out by process of elimi nation that a sound he has never heard before must be the name of a toy he has never seen before Stein According to the authors of the study all of this suggests that mammals developed abilities to under stand sounds before humans learned to speak Czuczka and Ricos remarkable learning abilities may indicate that some parts of speech comprehension developed separately from human speech You dont have to be able to talk to understand Dr Fischer observes And Sue SavageRumbaughwhose language acquisition work at Georgia State University with the bonobo Kanzi is wellknowngoes even further in a commentary published in the same issue of Science sug gesting that if Rico had a human vocal tract one would presume that he should be able to say the names of the items as well or at least try to do so Stein Of course we might well add to this appendix of scientific com mentary that appears alongside the publication of the study in Science the remarks of Daniel Dennett the director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University whose books Consciousness Explained and Kinds of Minds Toward an Understanding of Consciousness would seem to shed light not only on what we have discovered about the cogni tive abilities and mental life of our Uberpooch but also on the ethical implications thereof Indeed from Dennetts point of view it is hard to overstate how much it matters in ethical terms that we are able to be as specific as possible about the cognition and consciousness of particular beings What makes a mind powerful he writes indeed what makes a mind consciousis not what it is made of or how big it is but what it can do Can it concentrate Can it be distracted Can it recall earlier events    When such questions as these are answered we will know everything we need to know about those minds in order to answer the morally important questions4 As Dennett puts language r epr esentation and species it Membership in the class of things that have minds provides an all important guarantee the guarantee of a certain sort of moral stand ing Only mindhavers can care only mindhavers can mind what hap pens 4 As I have already suggested Dennetts functionalist approach to questions such as what is a mindhavernot what is it but what can it dois perhaps what he is best known for but what I want to argue now is that Dennetts apparent functionalism and material ism are unable to escape the spell of the very philosophical tradition whose most extreme expression is Cartesian idealism that he suppos edly rejects In Kinds of Minds and throughout his work Dennett rightly rejects the idea that some central Agent or Boss or Audience 73 what he also sometimes calls a Cartesian puppeteer 80takes in and appreciates the information produced by the neural networks and uses it to steer the ship of subjectivity 73 In what he debunks as the myth of double transduction the nervous system first trans duces input from its environment light sound temperature etc into neural signals and then in a second moment in some special central place it transduces these trains of impulses into some other medium the medium of consciousness 72 The idea that the network itself could assume the role of the inner Boss and thus harbor conscious ness seems preposterous but that is exactly what happens he argues in the distributed networks in both brain and body from which con sciousness arises 73 To ask for something moreto assume that what you are is something else some Cartesian res cogitans in addition to all this brainandbody activityis to betray a deep confusion because what you are just is this organization of all the competitive activity between a host of competences that your body has developed 15556 To ask for more is to remain captive to what he calls the Cartesian theater the specter of a disembodied freefloating central knower or self who stands aside from and above these processes at once the product and appreciator of them Dennetts apparently robust materialist account of embodied consciousness and mentation buttressed by an impressive understand ing of neural networks evolutionary processes perceptual mecha nisms and the like would seem to find an apt accompaniment in an understanding of language within the context of a larger prosthetics language r epr esentation and species of signifying systems in all their technicity and exteriority one that would seem quite consonant with contemporary theorists in the hu manities and social sciences from Derrida and Kittler to Bateson and Luhmann5 The source of our greater intelligence when compared to our mammalian relatives he argues is not the size of our brains but our habit of offloading as much as possible of our cognitive tasks into the environment itselfextruding our minds that is our men tal projects and activities into the surrounding world where a host of peripheral devices we construct can store process and represent our meanings streamlining enhancing and protecting the processes of transformation that are our thinkinga process that releases us from the limitations of our animal brains And thanks to our pros thetically enhanced imaginations he continues we can formulate otherwise imponderable unnoticeable metaphysical possibilities6 The problem is that it is not clear how such prosthetic processes and devices can be said to constituteto store process and represent in Dennetts wordsour thinking After all if we pay attention to the material social technical and cultural complexities of such de vices then in what sense can the internal psychic states Dennett calls our thinking be said to be represented by such devices And this is obviously true not just for storage devices such as archives encyclo pedias books and the institutional and disciplinary contexts in which they are embedded but also for that first and most fundamental pros thesis of all language itself which cannot be said to represent our thinking for at least two reasons First as Niklas Luhmann has put it with characteristic astringency language like all forms of communi cation operates with an unspecific reference to the participating state of mind it is especially unspecific as to perception It cannot copy states of mind cannot imitate them cannot represent them7 Second there can be no representation of our thinking in language because the meaning of an utterance is always subject to differential interpretation an interpretation that itself takes place within multiply embedded pro tocols traditions conventions and so on If this werent the case then it would be a private language and we couldnt use it to communicate our thinking at all All of whichas David Wills has reminded us in multiple registers in his wonderful book Prosthesis and elsewhere is built in to the very logic of the prosthetic itself As Wills puts it we language r epr esentation and species are dealing here with technologies of the exteriorization of memory of which writing is a if not the fundamental historically identifiable form And this has serious consequences for how we think about sub jectivity because technology in these terms is the extemporization the movement out of selfpresence that permits and defines memory a prosthetization of the animate or the human that not only makes it difficult to rigorously distinguish the human from its inanimate other but also makes us forever removed from ourselves as the very condition of what it means to be human8 But the primary problem with Dennett as we are about to see is not just that he overlooks how the prosthetic nature of the human permanently destabilizes the boundaries between our thinking and anyoneor more radically anythingelses It is that he thenin a subsidiary moveuses a fundamentally representationalist concept of language that reinstalls the disembodied Cartesian subject at the very heart of his supposedly embodied materialist functionalism Indeed it is on this basis that the ontologically unique status of the human and all the ethical consequences that flow from itis established in Dennetts work Now few would argue with Dennetts observation that there is no step more uplifting more explosive more momentous in the his tory of mind design that the invention of language through which Homo sapiens stepped into a slingshot that has launched it far beyond all other earthly species in the power to look ahead and reflect But we begin to glimpse the problem with Dennetts theory in passages like the following The freefloating rationales that explain rudi mentary higherorder intentionality of birds and haresand even chimpanzeesare honored he writes in the designs of their ner vous systems but we are looking for something more we are looking for rationales that are represented in those nervous systems9 The problem here is not as he argues in Animal Consciousness What Matters and Why his insistence that we should be analyzing patterns of behavior external and internalbut not private and at tempting to interpret them in the light of evolutionary hypotheses re garding their past or current functions10 The problem here is that this something more turns out to be another version of the very user illusion that Dennett wants to rejecta userillusion provided by language r epr esentation and species Dennetts misunderstanding of language as something that can repre sent rationales in a nervous system as he puts it I want to pause for a moment to emphasize however brieflyin part to make it clear that I am not just picking on Dennettthat this theoretical misunderstanding and phenomenological misuse of language are common problems in work in and around the philosophical implica tions of cognitive science and I find them even in work that I admire by Gerald Edelman Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela among others11 Indeedto take only the last exampleMaturana and Varela offer an extremely valuable account of the evolutionary emergence of language proper from linguistic domainsan account that reaches back to Gregory Batesons important work on metacommunicative frames in mammalian communication especially in forms of play and forward to the latest work in these areas by Noam Chomsky Marc Hauser and others12 Maturana and Varela rightly conclude that on the basis of experimental evidence some nonhuman animals are capable of interacting with us in rich and even recursive linguistic domains and they even declare that based on these facts language remains a permanent biologic possibility in the natural drift of living beings13 But though it is certainly useful to combine their language now with Batesons to distinguish participation in a metacommunicative frame linguistic domains from the metametacommunicative frame that is language properthe ability to make a linguistic distinction of a linguistic distinction 210 as they put itit is questionbegging in the extreme as we have already seen to make the ontological category of subjectivity depend solely on this last attribute For as we have already seen to declare as Maturana and Varela do that selfconsciousness awareness mindthese are phenomena that take place in language 230 is to make a statement that if it is true is selfrefuting since as Luhmann would put it only language takes place in languagewhich is to say in a domain external to the self of selfconsciousness To return then to Dennett he argues that the sort of informa tional unification that is the most important prerequisite for our kind of consciousness is not anything we are born with not part of our in nate hardwiring but in surprisingly large measure is an artifact of our immersion in human culture So far so good But then Dennetts formulation takes a bizarre turn indeed language r epr esentation and species What that early education produces in us is a sort of benign user illusionI call it the Cartesian Theater the illusion that there is a place in our brains where the show goes on towards which all perceptual input streams whence flow all conscious intentions to act and speak I claim that other speciesand human beings when they are newborn simply are not beset by the illusion of the Cartesian Theater Until the organization is formed there is simply no user in there to be fooled14 But how one might ask is this really any different from the Cartesianism that Dennett rejects particularly when we remember his insistence on the difference between the freefloating rationales that explain rudi mentary higherorder intentionality of birds and hares that are merely a product of the designs of their nervous systems and the something more of human intentionality and consciousness rationales that are represented in those nervous systems Take for example the tortured trajectory of the following argu ment Many animals hide but dont think they are hiding Many ani mals flock but dont think they are flocking Dennett argues in Kinds of Minds15 they have knowhow as he puts it but not represented knowledge 154 Eventually some creatures began offloading problems into the world and just into other parts of their brains They began making and using representations but they didnt know they were doing so They didnt need to know Should we call this sort of unwitting use of representations thinking If so then we would have to say that these creatures were thinking but didnt know they were thinking Unconscious thinkingthose with a taste for para doxical formulations might favor this way of speaking but we could less misleadingly say that this was intelligent but unthinking behavior because it was not just not reflective but also not reflectableupon 154 The problem here is that reflectableupon behavior and represented knowledge in Dennetts scheme depend on the assumption that lan guage can provide by means of a grammatical fiction the very user illusion that Dennett has just disavowed Doubly problematic is that this conceptual and phenomenological restabilization of the subject by means of languageputting Humpty Dumpty back together again as it werenot only constitutes an illusion but also forms the very ontological specificity of the human itself an ontological specificity language r epr esentation and species that is no different in principle from the Cartesianism Dennett rejects Only here language is doing the work previously carried out by the Cartesian cogito As an example of such intelligent but unthinking behavior Dennett offers the distraction display among some species of low nesting birds who when predators approach their nest put on an os tentatious show of feigned injury captivating the predators attention and promising an easy kill that the predator now drawn away from the vulnerable eggs is never quite able to make 12122 Such behav iors among nonhuman animals are quite abundant and wellknown but none of them Dennett argues manifests what he calls the work ings of a thirdorder intentional system An important step toward becoming a person was the step up from a firstorder intentional system to a secondorder intentional system A first order intentional system has beliefs and desires about many things but not about beliefs and desires A secondorder intentional system has be liefs and desires about beliefs and desires its own or those of others A thirdorder intentional system would be capable of such feats as wanting you to believe that it wanted something 120 If this has a familiar ring to it it should because it is exactly the strat egy that Jacques Lacan famously usesin his essay of 1960 The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious16to juridically separate the human from the animal as that being alone among the living who can lie by telling the truth The animal in Lacans terms can pretend but not pretend to pretend only the human as subject of the signifier can do that As Jacques Derrida summarizes Lacans position in a recent essayand here the distance between Dennetts discourse and Lacans will become abso lutely minimal There is according to Lacan a clear distinction between what the ani mal is capable of namely strategic pretense    and what it is incapable of and incapable of witnessing to namely the deception of speech la tromperie de la parole within the order of the signifier and of Truth The deception of speech    involves lying to the extent that in promising what is true it includes the supplementary possibility of telling the truth in order to lead the other astray on order to have him believe something language r epr esentation and species other than what is true we know the Jewish story recounted by Freud and so often quoted by Lacan Why do you tell me that you are going to X in order to have me believe you are going to Y whereas you are indeed going to X According to Lacan the animal would be in capable of this type of lie of this deceit of this pretense in the second degree whereas the subject of the signifier within the human order would possess such a power and better still would emerge as subject instituting itself and coming to itself as subject by virtue of this power a seconddegree reflexive power a power that is conscious of being able to deceive by pretending to pretend17 As I have already suggested one of the ironies of Dennetts discourse is that even as it promises a rigorous clearheaded view of these complexitiesDont confuse ontological questions about what exists with epistemological questions about how we know about it he ad monishes in the opening pages of Kinds of Mindsit reproduces in detail the Cartesian position it claims to move beyond and does so moreover precisely because it is unwilling or unable to pursue the full implications of the paradoxical formulations such as intelligent but unthinking behavior that it leads itself into but refuses to think through As Derridas later work makes clear that Cartesianism rests on two fundamental points 1 the assertion that animals however so phisticated they may be can only react but not respond to what goes on around them And this is so because 2 the capacity to respond depends on the ability to wield concepts or representations which is in turn possible only on the basis of languageand precisely in the sense voiced by Dennett when he writes No matter how close a dogs concept of cat is to yours extensionally you and the dog discriminate the same sets of entities as cats and noncats it differs radically in one way the dog cannot consider its concept    No languageless mammal can have a concept of snow in the way we can because a languageless mammal has no way of considering snow in general or in itself18 Two points need to be registered hereone experimental or sci entific as it were and one philosophical First as Donna Haraway has recently pointed out the entire picture of language and nonhuman mental life has become considerably more complicated during the past several years Indeed even Noam Chomsky has recently argued in a paper coauthored with two Harvard researchers that the available language r epr esentation and species data suggests a much stronger continuity between animals and humans with respect to speech than previously believed We argue that the con tinuity hypothesis thus deserves the status of a null hypothesis which must be rejected by comparative work before any claims of uniqueness can be validated For now this null hypothesis of no truly novel traits in the speech domain appears to stand This conclusion is based in no small part on the authors contention that even if we distinguish between lan guage in the broad sensecomposed of many interacting subsystems sensorimotor and computationalintentional that do not necessarily evolve as a unit as Haraway puts itand language in a more narrow sense the recursive ability to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements as they write linguistic uniqueness in this second sense must be a testable hypothesis not an assumption rooted in premises of human exceptionalism in Haraways words19 Most of the recent experimental data as it happens does not tend in the direction of an unquestioned exceptionalism In fact Chomsky and his colleagues argue that the powerful capacities such as those that manifest them selves in the capability of discrete infinity that characterizes language in the narrow sense might well have evolved in Haraways words in domains other than communication such as territory mapping spatial navigation and foraging and then been hijacked for communication in ways uncoupled from tight constraints of function 373n44 And this of course has profound implications for the ontologicaland eventually ethicalstatus of nonhuman beings for it would lead us to disarticulate these questions from language ability in the limited sense rather than assimilate and collapse them as Dennett has done As Marc Hauser one of Chomskys coauthorsargues in a separate study and again I quote Haraway this means that organisms possess heterogeneous sets of mental tools complexly and dynamically put together from genetic developmental and learning interactions throughout their lives not unitary interiors that one either has or does not have20 This in turn leads me to my second point the philosophical one that Dennetts supposedly hardnosed materialist account of em bodied consciousness falls in line not just with the philosophical ideal ism of Descartes but also that of Heidegger whose characterization of the animal as that which has a world in the mode of nothaving depends as Derrida argues in Of Spirit on the inability of the animal language r epr esentation and species to have access to entities as such and in their Being because of a lack of language that is not primarily or simply linguistic but rather as Derrida puts it derives from the properly phenomenological impos sibility of speaking the phenomenon21 In light of Derridas critique then Dennetts discourse takes its place in a long line of philosophers from Aristotle to Lacan Kant Heidegger and Levinas all of whom as Derrida puts it say the same thing the animal is without language Or more precisely unable to respond to respond with a response that could be precisely and rigorously distinguished from a reaction22 Even those who from Descartes to Lacan have conceded to the said animal some aptitude for signs and for communication Derrida con tinues have always denied it the power to respondto pretend to lie to cover its tracks or erase its own traceshence the fallback position we find here in Dennett and Lacan when more explicitly metaphysical versions of humanism are no longer available the difference between communication and metacommunication signifying and signifying about signifying thinking and knowing youre thinking and so on But the problem with this position as Derrida points out is that it seems difficult in the first place to identify or determine a limit that is to say an indivisible threshold between pretense and pretense of pretense How could one distinguish he continues for example in the most elementary sexual parade or mating game be tween a feint and a feint of a feint If it is impossible to provide the criterion for such a distinction one can conclude that every pretense of pretense remains a simple pretense animal or imaginary in Lacans terms or else on the contrary and just as likely the every pretense however simple it may be gets repeated and reposited undecidably in its possibility as pretense of pretense human or symbolic in Lacans terms    Pretense presupposes taking the other into account it therefore supposes simultaneously the pretense of pretensea simple supplementary move by the other within the strategy of the game That supplementarity is at work from the moment of the first pretense23 The distinction between the inscription of the trace and its era sure as the means by which to juridically separate the human from animal fares no better As Derrida argues in that same essayand this is why so long ago I substituted the concept of trace for that of signi language r epr esentation and species fier he begins by sayingthe structure of the trace presupposes that to trace amounts to erasing a trace as much as to imprinting it    How can it be denied that the simple substitution of one trace for another the marking of their diacritical difference in the most elementary inscriptionwhich capacity Lacan concedes to the animalinvolves erasure as much as it involves the imprint It is as difficult to assign a frontier between pretense and pretense of pretense to have an indivis ible line pass through the middle of a feigned feint as it is to assign one between inscription and erasure of the trace 137 first italics mine The point here as Derrida argues is less a matter of asking whether one has the right to refuse the animal such and such a power    than of asking whether what calls itself human has the right to rigorously attribute to man    what he refuses the animal and whether he can ever possess the pure rigorous indivisible concept as such of that at tribution Thus were we even to supposesomething I am not ready to concedethat the animal were incapable of covering its tracks by what right could one concede that power to the human to the subject of the signifier 138 What Derrida helps us to seeand we can only see it if we have the taste for paradoxical formulations that Dennett suggests we ignoreis that just because a particular discourse operates within pa rameters and conventions that we think of as scientific or presents itself as a materialist rendering of the problem of consciousness in rela tion to embodiment does not mean that the discourse is not meta physical As a methodological consideration for such a discourse language appears as a rather unimportant secondorder phenomenon whose job is to be as transparent as possible to the concepts and beyond that the objects it represents which is why the eventual goal for materialistic reductionism can be to eliminate language altogether At the same time paradoxically this apparently insubstantial thing called language constitutes the phenomenological and indeed ontological and ethical divide between human and nonhuman subjectivity paradoxically it constitutes the phenomenological specificity of the very being who then in an idealist abstraction if ever there was one rises above it to deploy it literally at willor in Dennetts terms by intention Indeed what Derrida writes about Austin and speech act theory in Signature Event Context applies even more pointedly to the language r epr esentation and species recovery and maintenance of the humanist subject in Dennett as what Derrida there calls a free consciousness present to the totality of the operation and of absolutely meaningful speech vouloirdire master of itself the teleological jurisdiction of an entire field whose organiz ing center remains intentionan intention that expresses itself for instance in the difference between pretending and pretending to pre tend thinking and knowing youre thinking and so on24 And this as we will see in multiple contexts throughout the next two chapters has farreaching consequences for the rigor and objectivity of the knowl edge that we think we can have of ourselves and of other nonhuman beings a rigor and objectivity that analytical philosophy and cogni tive science have typically reserved for themselves over and against the merely epistemological quandaries of poststructuralist philosophy For as Derrida points out it is not certain that what we call language or speech acts can ever be exhaustively determined by an objective sci ence or theory indeed it is more scientific to take this limit    into account and to treat it as a point of departure for rethinking this or that received concept of science and of objectivity25 All of this might be viewed as merely theoretical if you like were it not for the fact that Dennett himself insists that the ethical stakes of determining which creatures have mindsa determination that de pends in turn on a specific relation to languageare dire indeed On the one hand Dennett argues that the ethical course is to err on the side of overattribution just to be safe when considering the possibility of nonhuman minds because the ethical consequences of being niggardly and then later being found wrong could be grave26 At the same time however he writes It may not be able to talk but surely it thinks one of the main aims of this book has been to shake your confidence in this familiar reaction 159 But because a deeply flawed theory of talking is central to a representationalist notion of thinking in Dennetts work and because only things that think that is to say both think and know they are thinking have minds and because only things that have minds and we might add know they have minds merit ethical consid eration Dennett is forced to embrace ethical implications that despite his generous gestures to the contrary would seem to run counter to the supposed point of his entire project which is to take seriously the statusepistemologically and ethicallyof different kinds of minds language r epr esentation and species Take for example Dennetts rendering of the difference between pain and suffering which unwittingly reproduces the very Cartesianism that Dennett has time and again declared the enemy Dennett writes that we might well think that the capacity for suffering counts for more in any moral calculations than the capacity for abstruse and sophisticated reasoning 16227 But on this point Dennett follows Descartes almost to the letter Descarteswho is often misunderstood on this pointinsisted not that animals do not feel those sensations we call pain but only that they do not experience them as suffering because there is no one home no subject of the cogito to do the experiencing and thus the pain is not morally relevant28 Similarly Dennett argues that for such states to matterwhether or not we call them pains or conscious states or experiencesthere must be an enduring subject to whom they matter because they are a source of suffering 161 My point here of course is not that human and nonhuman ani mals all experience the same kinds or levels of suffering even the most ardent animal rights philosophers such as Peter Singer agree that they do not29 My point is that the difference between pain and suffer ing in Dennett turns out to be not just a difference in degree but a difference in kind an ontological difference one that simply reproduces on another level the difference between thinking and knowing youre thinking having thoughts and having represented thoughts and so on30 The problem in other words is with the unwitting Cartesianism of Dennetts enduring subject which in turn leads him not surpris ingly to embrace some ethical conclusions that should I think give us pause For example when Dennett attempts to draw out the ethical consequences of his contention that human consciousness    is a nec essary condition for serious suffering 165 he ends up suggesting that a dissociated child does not suffer as much as a nondissociated child 164 And just as different forms of being human in the world are re written as they are here in terms of a homogeneous Cartesian ideal so nonhuman beings in all their diversity are now rendered not as fully complete forms of life that are radically irreducible to such a thin idealized account of what counts as subjectivity but rather as dimin ished or crippled versions of that fantasy figure called the humanthe Cartesian cogito now rewritten as the userillusion qua enduring sub ject Nonhuman animals are now seen as creatures that are naturally language r epr esentation and species dissociatedthat never achieve or even attempt to achieve the sort of complex internal organization that is standard in a normal child and disrupted in a dissociated child 164 The problem here is not the ethical foregrounding of pain and suffering The problem is that Dennetts ontological distinction be tween pain and suffering is based on a set of phantom abilities an chored by but not limited to language and its imagined representa tional capacities in relation to the world of things that no subject either nonhuman or human possesses in fact I will return to these issues in much greater detail in the next chapter but for the moment we can get an even sharper sense of this by reference to Derridas very different approach to the question of nonhuman suffering which takes place ironically enough by way of the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham who anchors the animal rights philosophy of Peter Singer The relevant question here Bentham asserts is not can they talk or can they reason but can they suffer For Derrida putting the question in this way changes everything because from Aristotle to Descartes from Descartes especially to Heidegger Levinas and Lacanand we might add to Dennettposing the question of the animal in terms of the capacity for either thought or language deter mines so many others concerning power or capability pouvoirs and attributes avoirs being able having the power to give to die to bury ones dead to dress to work to invent a technique31 What makes Benthams reframing of the problem so powerful is that now the ques tion is disturbed by a certain passivity    a notbeingable What of the vulnerability felt on the basis of this inability Derrida continues what is this nonpower at the heart of power    What right should be accorded it To what extent does it concern us It concerns us di rectly in fact for mortality resides there as the most radical means of thinking the finitude that we share with animals the mortality that belongs to the very finitude of life to the experience of compassion32 From this vantageto return now to the story with which we beganwe can derive from the exploits of Rico the Uberpooch an un expected lesson whose ethical as well as epistemological resonance we are now in a position to appreciate that even though thinking about the consciousness intelligence and emotional and mental lives of nonhuman animals in terms of their linguistic abilities has historically language r epr esentation and species been a crucial means for getting such questions on the table at all33 it may not be the best way and it is certainly not the only way of ap proaching these questions Indeedand I will explore this point on a much broader canvas in my discussion of Temple Grandin in chapter 5 Ricos prodigious signifying abilities may be only one sign among many others and only the one most readily legible to us as language dependent creatures of a thinking if thats what we want to call it that we ought to be interested in not because it is a diminished or dim approximation of ours but because it is part of a very different way of being in the world that calls on us to rethink ever anew and vigilantly so what we mean by person mind consciousnessthat entire cluster of terms and the ethical implications that flow from them In this light as Derrida suggests It would not be a matter of giving speech back to animals but perhaps of acceding to a thinking however fabu lous and chimerical it might be that thinks the absence of the name and of the word otherwise as something other than a privation34 What I am suggesting here is that your theory of language mat ters and it matters not just epistemologically as well see in chapter 3 or methodologically chapter 4 because all sorts of consequences both ontological and ethical follow in its wakeconsequences that I have here tried to draw out on the terrain of the question of species differ ence and the question of subjectivity But I am also suggesting that there is an interdisciplinary imperative we need to undertake when ad dressing such complex questions If it is true that cognitive science has an enormous amount to contribute to the area of philosophy that we used to call phenomenologyif it has even in a way taken it over then it is also true that the textually oriented humanities have much to teach cognitive science about what language is and isnt and how that in turn bears on any possible philosophy of the subject human or animal This is simply to say that it will take all hands on deck I think to fully comprehend what amounts to a new reality that the human occupies a new place in the universe a universe now populated by what I am prepared to call nonhuman subjects And this is why to me post humanism means not the triumphal surpassing or unmasking of some thing but an increase in the vigilance responsibility and humility that accompany living in a world so newly and differently inhabited This page intentionally left blank Flesh and Finitude Bioethics and the Philosophy of the Living But who me jacques derrida Limited Inc Bioethics Inc What is bioethics now With what questions is it properly concerned And how is its ability to address those questions predisposed or fore closed by a certain set of theoretical and philosophical commitments To ask the question What can bioethics be thinking is to raise the question of not just its institutional norms which are powerfully vested indeed but also its philosophical norms In that light I will make the case that bioethics in its dominant mode of practice needs to undertake what one recent philosopher calls following Wittgenstein a gram matical redescription1 of its chosen domain if it is to more fully and responsibly address the bio of bioethicsthe question of what Derrida calls simply but not so simply the living in general2 At stake here is not just a style of doing philosophy but more important who and what can count as a subject of ethical address And from this vantage one of the central ironies of bioethics in its dominant institu tionalized form is that it is subtended by a certain notion of the human that remainsdespite wave after wave of changes in our understand ing of the bio of bioethicsnot only uninterrogated but indeed re trenched and nowhere more clearly or more predictably than in the confidence with which the boundary between human and nonhuman animals is taken for granted as an ethical nonissuethe very differ ence ironically enough that would seem thrown completely open to question by the very biotechnical and scientific developments with which contemporary bioethics is so concerned I make no pretense at giving anything like a complete picture flesh and finitude of contemporary bioethics but I can at least provide a snapshot with reference to one or two of its bestknown practitioners A glance at the table of contents of one of the leading textbooks in the field the col lection Contemporary Issues in Bioethics edited by Tom Beauchamp and LeRoy Walters will give at least some sense of the sorts of issues that occupy the field 1 patientprofessional relationships with particular focus on patients rights and specific patient populations this last including essays on involuntary hospitalization of the mentally ill medicine in an aging society and caring for socially undesirable patients among others 2 management of medical information with

epidemic with sections on the duty to warn and not to harm testing and screening programs and issues in clinical research on HIVAIDS3 Of particular interest here too are the particular sorts of docu ments and authors included To be sure one finds the usual academic essay in abundance but roughly 25 to 30 percent of the contributions are from legal corporate governmental or professional organizations or bodies We find for example the American Medical Associations Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs contributing a document titled Fundamental Elements of the PatientPhysician Relationship v the American Hospital Association providing A Patients Bill of Rights vi contributions by the Presidents Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry the Council of Europe the World Medical Association and similar bodies and a large number of legal documents and rulings by the Court of Appeals of both the United States and the District of Columbia Supreme Courts of both the United States and California and various branches of state and federal government All of which raises a question that goes to the very heart of contemporary bioethics the question of codification which involves as Derrida flesh and finitude them There has been a parallel shift in the right of death or at least a tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a lifeadministering power and to define itself accordingly This death that was based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure maintain or develop its life by means of a power that exerts a positive influence on life that endeavors to administer optimize and multiply it subjecting it to pre cise controls and comprehensive regulations5 As Foucault puts it in one of the more important passages in all of his later work one worth quoting at length This was nothing less than the entry of life into history that is the entry of phenomena peculiar to the life of the human species into the order of knowledge and power into the sphere of political techniques It is not a question of claiming that this was the moment when the first contact between life and history was brought about On the contrary the pressure exerted by the biological on the historical had remained very strong for thousands of years epidemics and famine were the two great dramatic forms of this relationship that was always dominated by the menace of death But through a circular process the economic and primarily agriculturaldevelopment of the eighteenth century and an increase in productivity and resources    allowed a measure of relief from these profound threats despite some renewed outbreaks the period of great ravages from starvation and plague had come to a close before the French Revolution death was ceasing to torment life so directly    Western man was gradually learning what it meant to be a living species in a living world to have a body conditions of exis tence probabilities of life an individual and collective welfare forces that could be modified and a space in which they could be distributed in an optimal manner For the first time in history no doubt biological existence was reflected in political existence 264 Within this general historical shift and mutation in the forms of power comprising modern society the areas of health and what will come to be called the biomedical take on new politically central roles directly linked to the reproduction of both the state and capitalist rela tions 263 Such a power Foucault continues has to qualify mea sure appraise and hierarchize rather than display itself in its murder ous splendor    The judicial institution is increasingly incorporated into a continuum of apparatuses medical administrative and so on whose functions are for the most part regulatory 266 In this con text he argues the emergence of the health and physical wellbeing of the population in general becomes one of the essential objectives of political power which focuses on how to raise the level of health of the social body as a whole Different power apparatuses are called upon to take charge of bodies not simply to exact blood service from them or levy dues but to help and if necessary constrain them to en sure their own good health The imperative of health at once the duty of each and the objective of all6 Not surprisingly then Medicine as a general technique of health even more than as a ser vice to the sick or an art of cures assumes an increasingly important place in the administrative system and the machinery of powera role which is constantly widened and strengthened throughout the eighteenth century The doctor wins a footing within the different in stances of social power The administration acts as a point of support and sometimes a point of departure for the great medical inquiries into the health of populations and conversely doctors devote an increas ing amount of their activity to tasks both general and administrative assigned to them by power A medicoadministrative knowledge be gins to develop concerning society its health and sickness its condi tions of life housing and habits which serves as the basic core for the social economy and sociology of the nineteenth century And there is likewise constituted a politicomedical hold on a population hedged in by a whole series of prescriptions relating not only to disease but to general forms of existence and behavior7 As even a cursory glance at the table of contents of Contemporary Issues in Bioethics suggests bioethics as it is currently institutionalized represents something like the apotheosis of this medicoadministrative edifice and its dense imbrication in contemporary apparatuses and institutions of state and economic power serving as it were as its selfdesignated conscience The obvious problem with this is that the functions of conscience and those of establishing policies palatable to both state and economic power do not always or even often go hand in hand and while there may be precious few compulsions on the side of conscience for the field of bioethics there is no shortage of them on the side of policy Indeed professional bioethicists routinely cultivate flesh and finitude relations with the biomedical research industry and its university liai sons that would seem to mitigate against the kind of skepticism and autonomy that the role of selfdesignated conscience would demand8 Of course practicing bioethicists would be the first to say that they must do this if they are not to be cut out of the decisionmaking process about biomedical research policy altogetherbut that simply proves the point that in contemporary bioethics the tail does indeed wag the dog in an arrangement that one critic calls Real Ethik To simply declare certain procedures such as human cloning immoral and call for an immediate and permanent ban is to ignore brazenly the history of technology one lesson of which might fairly be summarized as If it can be done it will be done This dictates what one bioethicist calls a pragmatic approach to bioethics in which for example we are wasting our time huffing and puffing about an international ban on human cloning Get over it he asserts its not going to happen9 Of course such a positionwhich might be characterized as dropping the pretense that the fox is not guarding the chicken coop might well be a cause for concern and some of it has come from within the community of bioethicists themselves Carl Elliott who is con cerned to make the field more philosophically nuanced and responsive to the real complexities it faces puts it this way If the occupational hazard of philosophy is uselessness that of medicine is an unthink ing pragmatism When bioethics is driven solely by clinical concerns usually those of the hospital it runs the danger of getting stuck in a permanent feedback loop in which the same issues are discussed again and again    Constrained by the demand for immediately useful an swers clinical ethics at its worst at any rate comes dangerously close to being a purely technical enterprise carried out in isolation from any kind of deep reflection about the examined life It will come as no surprise then as Elliott puts it that the law is the lingua franca of bio ethics The language in which bioethics is discussed revolves around largely quasilegal notions such as consent competence rights to re fuse treatment to have an abortion and so on Many writers have tar geted the language of rights and autonomy for special criticism    But I also think that the laws influence on bioethics has been much deeper and more subtle It has given us a picture of morality as some how like the law in structure10 the point The collection is fronted by an opening section on ethical theory at whose core lies a section titled Ethical Principles of which in the authors view there are three primary ones respect for au tonomy beneficence and justice11 The first emerging from an essentially Kantian view of the person as end and not means is de fined as freedom from external constraint and the presence of criti cal mental capacities such as understanding intending and voluntary decisionmaking capacity a picture of the subject drawn from the liberal philosophical tradition that we will have ample opportunity to scrutinize later In this view if autonomy is to be limited it is only because it conflicts with one or both of the other two principles be neficence which is defined as the active promotion of good kindness and charity including the core directive primum non nocere above all do no harm 20 and the principle of justice which the authors define in the following way Common to all theories of justice is a minimal beginning principle Like cases should be treated alike or to use the language of equality equals ought to be treated equally and unequals unequally In bioethics this principle tends to take the form of a focus on distributive justice the fair equitable and appropriate distribu tion    of primary social goods such as economic goods and funda mental political rights 22 including access to various kinds of health care the ability to pay for such access and so on12 As Elliott points out these kinds of discussions take a fairly pre dictable form in which bioethicists conventionally take concepts like person and define or redefine them so that they can be strictly and consistently applied Once language is thus refined we will know how words should be used and thus how we should act13 Elliott continues This way of reasoning says we can figure out what to do in this case if we can just get straight about what a person is That is we know how to treat a person so if we decide that this marginal being is a persona fetus an anencephalic or a neurologically damaged adultor say a primate used in biomedical researchthen a conclusion about how we should morally treat that marginal being will logically follow 159 But the problem here from Elliotts point of view is the notion that we can somehow define what a person is apart from our moral at titudes towards persons and that once we get the definition right this flesh and finitude will tell us what our moral attitudes should be 159 But this is not the way our moral grammar works he argues in fact just the oppo site Our moral attitudes are not grounded by a theory of persons they are built into our language Part of what we mean by the word person entails a certain moral attitude 160 And when Elliott says moral grammar here he means it in a specifically Wittgensteinian sense as in Wittgensteins wellknown statement that to imagine a language is to imagine a form of life14 And equally Wittgensteinian is Elliotts contention that bioethics generally if implicitly assumes its subject matter to be questions of conduct and sometimes character    It does not conventionally consider questions about the sense or mean ing of life and it considers only in very awkward constructions such as quality of life those questions about what makes life worth living These are ultimate questions about the framework against which our judgments of value get their sense but they are for the most part ab sent or at least hidden in mainstream bioethics15 To put it another way it may be that the pragmatism of Real Ethik in bioethics dictates shifting from policies of stark authorizationpro hibition to a web of regulation and incentives from ultimatums to real diplomacy from grandstanding to nuance and compromise16but in the name of what exactly against what background to use the Wittgensteinian term The answer typically given by bioethics is to maximize the general social welfare and to minimize harm17 but as we shall see and as Elliott has already suggested this reply begs all sorts of questions not the least of which is how it can be distinguished from a simple appeal to social norms and more pointedly the preju dices and pragmatic expediencies on which such consensus is based Of these prejudices none is more symptomatic of the current state of bio ethics than prejudice based on species difference and an incapacity to address the ethical issues raised by dramatic changes over the past thirty years in our knowledge about the lives communication emotions and consciousness of a number of nonhuman speciesa prejudice that bio ethics shares with the very core of a centuriesold humanism that con temporary bioethics and its scifi scenarios appear but only appear to have always already left behind18 This is entirely to the point for the field of contemporary bioethics of course simply because millions of animals are used in the area of biomedical research each year19 Elliotts observation about moral attitudes not being grounded by a theory of persons but rather built into our language is perfectly exemplified by the bioethicist Arthur Caplans attempt to confront or evade the question of our obligations to nonhuman animals espe cially those used in biomedical research in a recent essay on the ethical complexities of xenotransplantation using animal organs for trans plantation into humans I choose Caplan not because he is an easy mark a retrograde voice in the field quite the contrary he is in many ways one of its more progressive voices And he is certainly one of its most visible in addition to running the University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics he is a regular columnist for MSNBC and appears regularly in the major media as the designated expert in contemporary bioethics Caplans essay Is the Use of Animal Organs for Transplants Immoral puts on display exactly the kind of confusion that Elliott objects to and on every page evinces the kind of contamination of eth ics by pragmatic expediency and ethnocentrism that is the hallmark of the Real Ethik of contemporary bioethics20 At the core of the essay Caplan argues that it is acceptable to use some animals even primates to demonstrate the feasibility of xenografting in human beings and that this is so for a familiar set of reasons First he argues that the differences in the capacities and abilities of humans and primates he lists the familiar litany language tool use rationality intentional ity and so on justify a different moral status He concedes that all of these are found in nonhuman species but he asserts that humans are capable of a much broader range of behavior and intellectual function ing than is any other primate species and that therefore humans and nonhuman animals are not moral equivalents21 One might well begin by observing that there is a fundamental slippage here that needs to be clarified before we can make any real headway on this question As even the most famous animal rights phi losopher on the planet Peter Singer has argued the question is not and has never been whether humans and nonhuman animals are the same morally As Singer puts it the issue is not saying that all lives are of equal worth or that all interests of humans and other animals are to be given equal weight no matter what those interests may be It is saying that where animals and humans have similar interestswe flesh and finitude might take the interest in avoiding physical pain as an example for it is an interest that humans clearly share with other animalsthose inter ests are to be counted equally with no automatic discount just because one of the beings is not human22 A further problem with Caplans position is that it is open to the objection by means of what is often called the argument from mar ginal cases As the philosopher Paola Cavalieri puts it Concretely it is not true that all human beings possess the attributes that allegedly mark the difference between us and the other animals It is undeni able that there exist within our species individuals who on account of structural problems due to genetic or developmental anomalies or of contingent problems due to diseases or accidents will never acquire or have forever lost the characteristicsautonomy rationality self consciousness and the likethat we consider as typically human23 This objection also undermines Caplans second point Human be ings can be ethical he writes They may act this way only rarely and some may never do so but we are creatures capable of moral activ ity and moral responsibility Humans can be moral agents while ani mals even other primates are moral subjects24 As we have just seen however even if this assertion is true of nonhuman animals it is cer tainly not true of all human beingsnamely those marginal cases just referenced And yet we refrain from using them to harvest organs while we do so with other animals who are demonstrably superior in relevant moral characteristics Moreover as Cavalieri points out a position such as Caplans rests on a fundamental slippage between the question of moral agents and moral patients This view may appear plausible she writes but is in fact ambiguous It can indeed mean two different things a that only rational and autonomous beings can be morally respon sible or b that only what is done to rational and autonomous beings has moral weight As Cavalieri puts it If the moral agent is a being whose behavior may be subject to moral evaluation the moral patient is a being whose treatment may be subject to moral evaluation25 From this vantage it is irrelevant as Caplan puts it that animals are inca pable of being held to account for what they do since the fundamental issue here is not their behavior but rather our treatment of them One might say the same after all of a human being suffering from severe schizophrenia or a small child or an elderly person suffering from Alzheimers disease and so on Caplans final line of defense in response to the marginalcases problem is perhaps the most telling and disturbing of all The reason that even the severely retarded or permanently comatose person should not be used in the same research in which we use a more fully endowed great ape has nothing to do with the properties capacities and abilities of chil dren or infants who lack and have always lacked significant degrees of intellectual and cognitive function The reason they should not be used is because of the impact using them would have upon other human be ings    The assessment of the morals of how we treat each other and animals does not hinge simply on the properties that each possesses Relationships must enter into the equation as well and when they do the balance begins to tip toward human rather than animal interests when there is a conflict26 The problem with this position of course is twofold at least Ethically speaking it is a not even thinly disguised appeal to ethnocentrism and prejudice under the cover term relationsin this case prejudice on the basis of species membership and logically speaking it is utterly circular As for the first this appeal to relational rather than individ ual characteristics though it seems commonsensical and clearheaded enough is in fact ethically pernicious and just how pernicious is re vealed by a little experiment that Cavalieri conducts with it in her book The Animal Question First she quotes the same relational position held by Caplanthis time from the work of Robert Nozick Perhaps it will turn out Nozick contends that the bare species characteristic of simply being human    will com mand special respect only from other humansthis is an instance of the general principle that the members of any species may legitimately give their fellows more weight than they give members of other species or at least more weight than a neutral view would grant them Lions too if they were moral agents could not then be criticized for putting other lions first27 But what is revealed about this position Cavalieri asks if we plug in other terms instead flesh and finitude white    will command special respect only from other whitesthis is an instance of the general principle that the members of any race may legitimately give their fellows more weight than they give members of other races or at least more weight than a neutral view would grant them Blacks too    could not then be criticized for putting other blacks first 80 Caplan may want to fall back on the view that says that we are powerful and the primates are less so therefore they must yield to human purposes This line of response he contends is far removed from the kinds of arguments that should be mustered in the name of morality28 But the point here is that in reality that is the kind of argu ment Caplan is making As Tom Regan puts it Might according to this theory does make right Let those who are the victims of injustice suffer as they will It matters not so long as no one else    cares about it    As if for example there would be nothing wrong with apartheid in South Africa if few white South Africans were upset by it29 In more strictly philosophical terms at the core of this position is a fundamental selfdefeating confusion familiar to us since Humes Law which insists on the distinction between facts and values that what ought to be cannot be derived from what is30 Caplan doesnt just confuse the question what ought we to do with the question what are people likely to do he in fact subordinates the former to the latter In doing so bioethics becomes little more than the status quo with apologies Moreoverto return to my second pointit is not just that the position is ethnocentric it is also circular to wit we care about being X because we think of them as persons and we think of them as persons because we care about them But what is needed here of course is a disarticulation of the question of persons from the ques tion of membership in the species Homo sapiens And from this vantage the Wittgensteinian point about moral attitudes being built into our language is not some sort of positivism though it is sometimes under stood that way that holds that we should simply take for granted what we mean by persons On the contrary it suggests that we should be extraordinarilyindeed philosophicallyattuned to how forms of language what we say what we write how we ask philosophical questions open up certain lines of thoughtindeed the imagining of whole worldsand foreclose others From this point of view it is precisely the ungroundedness of what is meant by persons to take the example at hand that requires our dili gence about how philosophical questions are formulated In this light what becomes clear is that the philosophical impoverishment of bio ethics overdeterminesor perhaps we should say leaves undisturbed its ethical parochialism So when Caplan asks if it is ethical to use ani mals in research to study the feasibility of crossspecies xenografting and responds that in part the answer to this question pivots on whether or not there are plausible alternative models to the use of animals31 it is obvious that the question ostensibly being asked has already been decided since the question is really not can we consider using them but simply under what pragmatic circumstances Beyond Rights So far I have been responding to the shortcomings of bioethics in its own termsthat is to say the terms of analytical philosophy and what is sometimes called its justice tradition As I hope I have shown far too hastily Im afraid even in its own terms it is woefully inadequateboth ethically and philosophicallyfor confronting the complex questions of life death and our relations to other living beings that far exceed what bioethics currently constitutes as its unified field At this juncture we might move in one of two directions Along one tack we might remain within the purview of the analytical tradition and work more diligently to apply it consistently and dispassionately to the questions just raised which is essentially what we find in the work of Cavalieri Regan and Singer Conversely we might shift to another way of doing philosophy altogether one that has a very different notion of the relationship be tween the practice of philosophy and the kinds of questions that animate or ought to animate bioethics I want to explore both options here with the eventual aim of showing how the limitations of the analytic tradition for confronting these questions pivot on a certain understanding of the relationship between language philosophical concepts and subjectivity that shortcircuits our ability to think questions of ethics in relation to the living with the kind of subtlety and rigor they demand flesh and finitude Before moving to that part of my argument however I want to look briefly at one of the more recent attempts within the analytic tradition to redress some of the problems we have already discussed Martha Nussbaums use of an Aristotelian framework in Frontiers of Justice Disability Nationality Species Membership 2006 My concern here will be to show the limits of philosophical humanism for think ing about the status of nonhuman beings and our relations and duties to them which stems in part from its inability to locate the question properly More specifically if philosophical work that takes the moral status of nonhuman animals seriously is in some obvious sense post humanist in the sense that its want to challenge the ontological and ethical divide between humans and nonhumans is itself a linchpin of philosophical humanism such work may still be quite humanist on an internal theoretical and methodological level that recontains and even undermines an otherwise admirable philosophical project a point Ill return to in the next chapter So what I will try to do here is map a kind of philosophical or theoretical spectrum that moves from humanist approaches to posthumanism or antianthropocentrism to posthumanist approaches to posthumanism And my point here will be not to pursue a kind of moreposthumanistthanthou sweepstakes but to bring out in a detailed way how the admirable impulses be hind any variety of philosophy that challenges anthropocentrism and speciesismimpulses that I respect wherever they may be found demand a certain reconfiguration of what philosophy or theory is and how it can and cannot respond to the challenge that all the phi losophers discussed here want to engage the challenge of sharing the planet with nonhuman subjects and treating them justly Such differences should not obscure a remarkable fact with which Id like to begin that figures as diverse as Nussbaum Cora Diamond and Jacques Derrida all set out from the same starting point that an chors our ethical response to nonhuman animals namely how our shared embodiment mortality and finitude make us as Diamond puts it fellow creatures in ways that subsume the more traditional markers of ethical consideration such as the capacity for reason the ability to enter into contractual agreements or reciprocal behaviors and so onmarkers that have traditionally created an ethical divide between Homo sapiens and everything or everyone else Peter Singer might be added to the list as well for Singer more than thirty years ago in Animal Liberation drew attention to a passage buried as Paola Cavalieri has reminded us in a footnote in Jeremy Benthams Intro duction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation that also serves re markably enough as a crucial locus for Derridas later work on the question of the animal32 What else is it that should trace the insu perable line Bentham asks Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse But a fullgrown horse or dog is beyond com parison a more rational as well as a more conversable animal than an infant of a day or a week or even a month old But suppose the case were otherwise what would it avail The question is not Can they reason nor Can they talk but Can they suffer33 For Singer as well as for Derrida Benthams passagewith its rejection of the relevance of talk and the faculty of discourse as an ethically decisive difference between humans and nonhumansmarks a signal advance beyond the wellknown political animal passage in Aristotle which as Derrida has noted inaugurates an entire philosophical tradition of thinking the difference between human and nonhuman animals in terms of the humans ability to properly respond to its world rather than merely react to it an ability made possible so the story goes by language We will return to this point in some detail later but for the mo ment it is worth quoting Aristotle by way of contrast Now that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other gregarious animals is evident Aristotle writes Nature as we often say makes nothing in vain and man is the only ani mal whom she has endowed with the gift of speech And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure or pain and is therefore found in other animals for their nature attains to the perception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one another and no further the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and inexpedient and therefore likewise the just and the unjust34 Bentham shifts the focus however to the fact that the capacity for suffering as Singer puts it is not just another characteristic like the capacity for language or higher mathematics    The capacity for suf fering and enjoyment he continues is a prerequisite for having interests at all a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests flesh and finitude in a meaningful way35 Now one might think that the question of suf fering and more broadly of finitude and mortality that links us with nonhuman animals would be a rather philosophically straightforward matter but as we shall see exactly the opposite is the case In fact this question will be handled in different and even opposed ways by Singer Nussbaum Diamond and finally Derridadifferences that will be de finitive for understanding the difference between what I am calling humanist and posthumanist approaches to the question of nonhuman and human animal life Nussbaum for example asserts that utilitarianism has contrib uted more than any other ethical theory to the recognition of animal suffering as evil but she rejects Singers utilitarian view for many of the same reasons outlined by among others Tom Regan in The Case for Animal Rights 1983 For her not only is its sumranking of in terests problematic but it is also in a fundamental way beside the point of justice per se As for the first charge because the core utilitar ian principle is the greatest good for the greatest number of interest holding beings of whatever species in Singers scheme utilitarianism seems to have no way to rule out on grounds of basic justice the great pain and cruel treatment of at least some animals whose treat ment in a circus say might be justified on the grounds that the suf fering of ten or twenty animals brings greater pleasure on balance to hundreds of thousands of human beings As Regan summarizes the problem succinctly The victims pleasures and pains carry no more moral weight than the equal pleasures and pains of anyone else To count his pleasures or pains more heavily is ruled out by the egalitari anism claimed as one of the virtues of classical utilitarianism36 The problem in other wordsand this is Nussbaums second pointis that utilitarianism provides no way for animals to be direct subjects of jus tice It seems that the best reason to be against slavery torture and lifelong subordination she writes is a reason of justice not an em pirical calculation of total or average wellbeing that might or might not entail the maltreatment of a particular sentient being37 Moreover and again the point is articulated in great detail by Regan38 the derivation of fundamental interests from the principle of suffering is itself problematic for as Nussbaum at when we consider the entitlements of animals It seems plausible to think that there may be goods they pursue that are not felt as pain and frustration when they are absent And the reverse is true as well for example in the pain involved in the effort required to master a dif ficult activity 345 As an alternative Nussbaum argues not for the contractarian or social contract view promoted by John Rawls whose limitations in this case ought to be obvious enough39 but for the capabilities approach that she derives from Aristotle Now it may seem odd that Aristotle would be chosen as a guide in this realm given his decisive separation of humans from nonhuman animals on the basis of speech and rationality As Gary Steiner argues however there is a tension in Aristotles writings between the zoological texts such as History of Animals and Parts of Animals and the psychological metaphysical and ethical works such as On the Soul and the Nicomachean Ethics40 In the zoological texts Aristotle attributes to animals capacities that he treats in the psychological and ethical writings as applying only to human beingscapacities such as character intelligence ingenuity and emo tion and he provides a hint of the interpretation of such attributions when he says that we call the lower animals neither temperate nor selfindulgent except by a metaphor because these have no choice or calculation 71 Steiners position is that for Aristotle clearly there is a cosmic scheme of things and human beings are superior to ani mals in that scheme because only humans possess the contemplative ability that likens us to the gods 60an ability as we have seen decisively linked with reason and with speech Ultimately Steiner writes he is unable to do justice to both sides of the dichotomy be tween the human and animal realms But he may come closer to doing so than any other Western advocate of the superiority of human beings over animals chiefly on the strength of the broader but also specifi cally nonethical context provided by the zoological writings 72 It is this ambiguity in Aristotles position that Nussbaum seizes upon We might say then that Nussbaum tries to do for Aristotle what Regan did for Kant retrofit their theories by rejecting the central role of rationality as an ontological and ethical dividing line between hu mans and nonhuman animals Hence the rather onesided reading if we believe Steiner of Aristotle that we find in Nussbaum flesh and finitude The capabilities approach by contrast sees rationality and animality as thoroughly unified Takings its cue from Aristotles notion of the human being as a political animal    it sees the rational as simply one aspect of the animal and at that not the only one that is pertinent to a notion of a truly human functioning More generally the capabilities approach sees the world as containing many different types of animal dignity all of which deserve respect and even awe The specifically human kind is indeed characterized usually by a kind of rationality but rationality is not idealized and set in opposition to animality it is just gardenvariety practical reasoning which is one way animals have of functioning 159 Moreover she writes the Aristotelian idea of the human as the politi cal animal must receive the proper accentthe political animalso that we properly understand the human being as not just a moral and political being but one who has an animal body and whose human dignity rather than being opposed to this animal nature inheres in it and in its temporal trajectory from cradle to grave which involves long periods and sometimes unexpected modes of dependency and vulnerability as embodied beings 8788 Thus while the capabilities view includes an idea related to the contractarian idea of freedom 88 it by definition rejects the grounding of that freedom in a conception of the person as free equal and independent 87 What is fundamental to the ethical standing of both humans and nonhumansand this is readily brought into focus in animal rights philosophy by the analogy between the situation of nonhuman higher animals and severely disabled human beingsis not the contractarian idea that only those who can join a contract as rough equals can be primary nonderivative subjects of a theory of justice 327 but rather the embodiment and finitude of creatures of whatever species who may be deemed to use Tom Regans term the subject of a life41 As we have already seen this criterion is not reduc ible to sentience and suffering per se nor is the rightness or wrongness of how such beings are treated subject to the sumranking of inter ests that we find in Singers utilitarianism Instead the rightness or wrongness of our treatment of such subjectshuman or nonhuman is in Nussbaums view determined by the extent to which it enables or impedes their flourishing a flourishing that is based on a more or less empirical assessment of the capabilities needs characteristic behaviors and so on of the particular being in question The general aim of the capabilities approach in charting political principles to shape the humananimal relationship she writes would be that no sentient animal should be cut off from the chance for a flourishing life a life with the type of dignity relevant to that species and that all sentient animals should enjoy certain positive opportunities to flourish42 At this juncture it would be possibleindeed were I an ana lytic philosopher it might be imperativeto point out some of the many problems with Nussbaums approach even within the purview of its own terms For example it is not clear that it marks any advance over Regans rights position as articulated nearly twentyfive years ago with which it shares several core features the rejection of utilitarian sumranking and of its abstraction of interests from the beings who hold them as mere receptacles the rejection of contractarian theo ries the assertion that nonhuman animals may be direct subjects of jus tice and not just indirect or derivative ones and most important the nearly complete overlap of Nussbaums account of beings capable of flourishing with Regans subjectofalife43 In fact Regans view would seem to avoid two fundamental problems that plague the latter twothirds of Nussbaums treatment of the animal question where she attempts to draw out the conclusions of her view first the problem of determining what counts as human flourishing does it include hunting the exercise of evolutionary predatory instincts the right to procreate to the point of overpopulation and so on44 and second the unavoidability given her position of falling into precisely what she criticizes in the utilitarians namely the problem of balancing competing rights to flourishing human and nonhuman just as the utilitarians must rank competing interests Indeed what we might characterize as the methodological mini malism of both Singers account of interests and Regans of the subject ofalife is calculated to avoid what Geoffrey Harpham calls the human essentialism that plagues Nussbaums later work where Aristotle is called on as the first thinker to try and pick out those features of human life most distinctive of humanity and therefore most worth cultivat ing But missing from the inventory of acceptable human passions Harpham flesh and finitude that are in a sense dispassionate and responsive to the patient work of philosophy are to be considered part of the human essence the rest are merely constructed by social evaluations45 Most problematic of all here of course is the notorious List of Central Human Functional Capabilities that shows up regularly in Nussbaums later work46 It includes capabilities such as being able to move freely from place to place having ones bodily boundaries treated as sovereign    having opportunities for sexual satisfaction    Being able to use the senses to imagine think and reasonand to do these things in a truly human way    Being able to search for the ultimate meaning of life in ones own way Being able to have pleasurable experiences and to avoid non necessary pain    Being able to experience longing gratitude and justified anger and so forth As Harpham Elizabeth Costello is hauntedwounded to use a figure that Cora Diamond highlightsby how we treat nonhuman animals in practices such as factory farming a systemized and mechanized killing that she compares to the consternation of some in its scale and its violence to the Holocaust of the Jews during World War II At a dinner after one of her invited public lectures she is asked by the president of the uni versity whether her vegetarianism comes out of moral conviction and she responds against the expectations of her hosts No I dont think so    It comes out of a desire to save my soul And when the university administrator politely replies Well I have a great respect for it she retorts impatiently Im wearing leather shoes Im carrying a leather purse I wouldnt have overmuch respect if I were you49 What haunts Costello here also torments another of Coetzees characters David Lurie in the novel Disgrace Lurie a literature profes sor in South Africa whose career ends abruptly after he has an affair with a female undergraduate and is charged with sexual harassment moves to the country where his daughter Lucy has a small farm and begins volunteering at the local animal shelter where he assists in euthanizing the scores of animals mainly dogs for whom no homes can be found Lurie has never thought of himself as a sentimentalist as he puts it and he takes to the work reluctantly But then gradually he becomes absorbed in it He had thought he would get used to it Coetzee writes But that is not what happens The more killings he assists in the more jittery he gets Then one Sunday night as he is driving back from the clinic it hits him He actually has to stop at the roadside to recover himself Tears flow down his face that he cannot stop his hands shake He does not understand what is happening to him For reasons he doesnt understand his whole being is gripped by what happens in the surgical theatre50 Both characters experience headon the unnerving weight and gravity of our moral responsibilities toward nonhuman animals But both moments insist on something else too something that also in a different way unsettles the very foundations of what we call the human Both moments acknowledge a second kind of unspeakabil ity not only the unspeakability of how we treat animals in practices like factory farming but also the unspeakability of the limits of our own thinking in confronting such a realitythe trauma as Diamond puts flesh and finitude it of experiences in which we take something in reality to be resistant to our thinking it or possibly to be painful in its inexplicability51 Writ large in the terms of the postEnlightenment philosophi cal tradition this is often referred to as the problem of philosophical skepticism and part of what Diamond is interested in pressuring is the extent to which these two questions are or are not the same On this point Diamond draws on the work of Stanley Cavell who has explored the problem of skepticism with remarkable nuance and range over the past forty and more years a body of thought I will revisit in some detail in chapter 7 Working through figures as diverse as Kant Descartes Emerson Wittgenstein Austin and Heidegger among others Cavell has plumbed the consequences of what it means to do philosophy in the wake of what he calls the Kantian settlement with skepticism As Cavell characterizes it in In Quest of the Ordinary To settle with skepticism    to assure us that we do know the existence of the world or rather that what we understand as knowledge is of the world the price Kant asks us to pay is to cede any claim to know the thing in itself to grant human knowledge is not of things as they are in themselves You dontdo youhave to be a romantic to feel some times about that settlement Thanks for nothing52 But if in Cavells reading of Kant reason proves its power to itself over itself 30 by logically deriving the difference between the world of mere appear ances phenomena that we can know and the world of the Ding an sich noumena that our knowledge never touches then we find ourselves in a position that is not just odd but in fact profoundly unsettling for philosophy in a fundamental sense then fails precisely insofar as it suc ceeds We gain knowledge but only to lose the world The question in the wake of skepticism thus becomes what it can mean to continue to do philosophy after philosophy has become in a certain sense impossible One thing it does not mean if we be lieve Diamond is to think that such resistance of the world the difficulty of reality to use the phrase Diamond borrows from John Updike could be dissolved or overcome by ever more ingenious or ac complished propositional arguments ever more refined philosophical concepts or for that matter by the making of lists Indeed to think that it can to mistake the difficulty of philosophy for the difficulty of reality as do the philosophical Reflections published at the end of The Lives of Animals Diamond suggests is to indulge in a deflec tion of a reality that impinges on usbefalls us as Wittgenstein once put itin ways not masterable by the crafting of analytical argu ments That is why for Diamond Elizabeth Costello doesnt offer one in defense of her vegetarianism and it is also why Costello is quick to point to the inconsistency of her own practices with regard to animal products It is that impingement that pressure of reality that over takes David Lurie on the drive back from the clinic He literally does not know what is happening to him he has no reasons for it and he cant explain it And yet it is the most real thing in the world These fundamental challenges for philosophy are sounded out by Cavell in his reading of the philosopher most important to him Ralph Waldo Emerson and I will revisit that relationship in some detail in chapter 9 Emerson writes in his most important essay Experience I take this evanescence and lubricity of all objects which lets them slip through our fingers then when we clutch hardest to be the most unhandsome part of our condition For Cavell this moment regis ters the confrontation with skepticism certainly but it also voices an understanding of how philosophy must change in the wake of that confrontation For the unhandsome here names not just the Kantian Ding an sich but also Cavell writes what happens when we seek to deny the standoffishness of objects by clutching at them which is to say when we conceive thinking say the application of concepts in judgments as grasping something53 When we engage in that sort of deflection we only deepen the abysswhen we clutch hardest between our thinking and the world that we want to understand The opposite of clutching on the other handwhat Cavell calls the most handsome part of our conditionis facing the fact that the demand for unity in our judgments that our deployment of concepts is not the expression of the conditionedness or limitations of our humanness but of the human effort to escape our humanness54 Philosophy can hence no longer be seen as mastery as a kind of clutching or grasping via analytical categories and concepts that seemed for Heidegger a kind of sublimized violencethe kind of violence that Nussbaums critics find on display most egregiously of course in the List55 Rather the duty of thinking is not to deflect but to suffer remember Costellos woundedness what Cavell calls our exposure to the world flesh and finitude to bring out with reference to a poem by Ted Hughes Six Young Men whose last stanza she quotes to open The Difficulty of Reality The poem concerns the uncanny sense of confronting a photograph of young carefree men taken not long before they are all killed in World War I That mans not more alive whom you confront And shake by the hand see hale hear speak loud Than any of these six celluloid smiles are Nor prehistoric or fabulous beast more dead No thought so vivid as their smoking blood To regard this photograph might well dement Such contradictory permanent horrors here Smile from the single exposure and shoulder out Ones own body from its instant and heat What the poem helps to underscore is not just the experience of the minds not being able to encompass something which it encounters56 but also the unnerving proximity of life and deathand thus the im portant connection she will develop between the exposure of our con cepts to the confrontation with skepticism and the physical exposure to vulnerability and mortality that we suffer because we like animals are embodied beings As Diamond puts it in a key moment in her essay unpacking her sense of Costellos startling assertion that I know what it is like to be a corpse The awareness we each have of being a living body being alive to the world carries with it exposure to the bodily sense of vulnerability to death sheer animal vulnerability the vulnerability we share with them This vulnerability is capable of panicking us To be able to ac knowledge it at all let alone as shared is wounding but acknowledg ing it as shared with other animals in the presence of what we do to them is capable not only of panicking one but also of isolating one as Elizabeth Costello is isolated Is there any difficulty in seeing why we should not prefer to return to moral debate in which the livingness and death of animals enter as facts that we treat as relevant in this or that way not as presences that may unseat our reason 74 But there is yet a third type of exposure or finitude that is cru cial here as well as practiced readers of Heidegger or for that matter of Cavell or Derrida will already have guessed our exposurein a radical sense our subjectionto language and writing in ways that bear directly on what it means to do philosophy what philosophy can do in the face of these existential and ethical challenges One further conse quence of everything we have been saying thus far is that the relation ship between philosophical thinking concepts and philosophy as a writing practice now takes on unprecedented importance which is why Heidegger and Derrida and Cavell write the way they dowhich is to say unphilosophically even literarily Against the backdrop of what is often referred to as the linguistic turn in twentiethcentury philosophy we find a direct line of connection between the problem of philosophical skepticism and the work of Wittgenstein on language that will prove so important to Diamond and in a different way to Cavell But it is also on this point as I will try to bring out later that crucial differences emerge between this sort of work emerging as it does out of an especially adventurous wing of the analytical tradition and the work of Derrida who construes the consequences of the rela tion between philosophy and language of our finitude in relation to both in ways that bear directly on how we may and may not think of our relations to ourselves and to nonhuman animals Diamonds earlier work is worth revisiting here in some detail As she insists in an essay from 2001 called Injustice and Animals our grammatical redescription of a philosophical problem is crucial and in some sense determinative of our ability to do justice to the ethical challenges it entails57 For Diamond the fundamental ques tion of justice issues from an essentially different conceptual realm from the question of rights As she argues elaborating on some ideas of Simone Weil when genuine issues of justice and injustice are framed in terms of rights they are thereby distorted and trivial ized because the language of rights still bears the imprint of the con text in which it was shaped Roman law and its codification of property rightsnot least of course property rights over slaves 120 But the question of justice cannot be reduced to the question of the fairness or unfairness of a share The attempt to give voice to real injustice in the language of rights Diamond argues falters because of the underlying tie between rights and a system of entitlement that is con cerned not with evil done to a person but with how much he or she flesh and finitude gets compared to other participants in the system 121 In rights dis course she argues the character of our conflicts is made obscure by what Wittgenstein would call a poor grammatical description of the problem of justice 124 Instead what generates our moral response to animals and their treatment is our sense of the mortality and vulnerability that we share with them of which the brute subjection of the bodyin the treatment of animals as mere research tools say or in the torture of political pris oners in waris perhaps the most poignant testament For Diamond the horror at the conceptualizing of animals as putting nothing in the way of their use as mere stuff depends on a comparable horror at human relentlessness and pitilessness in the exercise of power toward other humans 136 What the rights tradition misses in her view is that the capacity to respond to injustice as injustice depends not on working out from a safe ontological distance as it were who should have a fair share of this or that abstract good but on a recognition of our own vulnerabilitya recognition not demanded and in some sense actively avoided by rightsoriented thinking 121 We can get a sense of the implications of this view for the grain of Diamonds thinking by following her discussion of a highly publicized case several years ago In a videotape smuggled out of the University of Pennsylvanias Head Injury Laboratory researchers and lab workers were shown making fun of a baboon who had been subjected to mas sive head injury in their experiments and was now serving as a mere prop for their jokes as one of the lab workers posed with one animal who had large cranial sutures and the rest of the staffincluding the director of the lablaughed at the animal and made fun of his punk look 148n41 Viewers almost without exception find this tape shock ing and deeply disturbingbut not Diamond argues in a way ac countable or defensible by either side of the animal rights debate For Diamond the nub of the issue here is that the animals body which is all it has as a poor mans body may be all he has is turned into the mere butt of your jokes the animal lacks the power to get away or to resist and what is morally repugnant is to make this disempower ment this absolute subjection the occasion for jokes But the moral repugnance of such a thing is not easily accounted for by the rights framework fixated as it is on the dependence of rights on interests good of the animal Not being a butt of humor is not taken to be part of its good Diamond writes It may seem to a defender of animal rights that although we should not ridicule animals it will be hard to make out that we owe it to the animals not to ridicule them In the background here is the idea that we cannot owe it to animals    unless they would suffer from such treatment and the idea would be that an animal cannot suffer from being ridiculed if it is not even aware that it is being ridiculed 13738 What such an insight points toward is that there is something wrong with the contrast taken to be exhaustive between demand ing ones rights and begging for kindnessbegging for what is merely kindness The idea that those are the only possibilities is    one of the main props of the idea that doing injustice is failing to respect rights 129 Contemporary moral theory thus pushes apart justice on the one hand and compassion love pity tenderness on the other 131 but Diamonds understanding of the question has at its center the idea that a kind of loving attention to another being a possible victim of injustice is essential to any understanding of the evil of injustice 13132 In this light one might well agree with Weils suggestion as Diamond does that in fact rights can work for justice or for in justice and as such the concept of rights possesses a kind of moral noncommitment to the good 128 In an important sense in other words rights are beside the point of justice per se and the language of rights is one might say meant to be useful in contexts in which we cannot count on the kind of understanding of evil that depends on lov ing attention to the victim 139 There are in other words two different and in fact incommen surable kinds of value here 121a point missed by both sides of what Diamond calls that great arena of dissociated thought contemporary debate about animals rights58 The problem with both sides of the debaterepresented by say Peter Singer on one side and on the other the philosopher Michael Leahy and his avatar Thomas OHearne in The Lives of Animalsis that they are locked into a model of justice in which a being does or does not have rights on the basis of its possession or lack of morally significant characteristics that can be empirically derived Both sides argue that what is involved in moral thought is flesh and finitude knowledge of empirical similarities and differences and the test ing and application of general principles of evaluation59 And so as Diamond puts it in The Difficulty of Reality the opposite sides in the debate may have more in common than they realize In the voices we hear in the debate about animal rights those of people like Singer on the one hand and those of Leahy and the fictional OHearne on the other there is shared a desire for a because because animals are this kind of being or because they are that kind of being thusandsuch is their standing for our moral thought 71 But what Diamond hears in both sets of voices is an evasion of our exposure to an arena of moral complexity in which to quote Cavell the other can present me with no mark or feature on the basis of which I can settle my attitude 71 Part of the reason for that of course is that such attitudes are far from the thin ifPthenQ abstractions that a certain kind of phi losophy takes them to be They are thick with psychological vexation and rife with contradictory impulses and attachments So Diamond is concerned to show not just that such a picture of ethics confuses the question of justice with the mediocre level of mere rights but also that it bears no resemblance to what she suggests is our moral life60 For her proponents of animal rights in the analytical tradition are wrong when they insist that the distinction between human and animal is not ethically fundamental At the same time however those who oppose animal rights within that same analytical tradition are wrong about how the difference between humans and animals is relevant The no tion human being is of the greatest significance in moral thought she argues but not because it is a biological notion 264 Rather the concept of human being is a main source of that moral sensibility which we may then be able to extend to nonhuman animals We can come to think of killing an animal as in some circumstances at least similar to homicide she continues but the significance of doing so depends on our already having an idea of what it is to kill a man and for us as opposed to abstract Moral Agents the idea of what it is to kill a man does depend on the sense of human life as special as something set apart from what else happens on the planet61 For Diamond then it is crucial to take account of what human beings have made of the difference between human beings and ani mals62 As she puts it elsewhere If we appeal to people to prevent suffering and we in our appeal try to obliterate the distinction between human beings and animals and just get people to speak or think of different species of animals there is no footing left from which to tell us what we ought to do    The moral expectations of other human beings demand something of me as other than an animal and we do something like imaginatively read into animals something like such expectations when we think of vege tarianism as enabling us to meet a cows eyes There is nothing wrong with that there is something wrong with trying to keep that response and destroy its foundation63 So for Diamond it is not by denying the special status of human being but by intensifying it that we can come to think of nonhuman animals not as bearers of interests or as rights holders but rather as something much more compelling fellow creatures That phrase does not mean biologically an animal something with biological life but rather refers to our response to animals as our fellows in mortality in life on this earth64 Hence the difference between human and nonhuman animals may indeed start out as a biological difference but it becomes some thing for human thought through being taken up and made something ofby generations of human beings in their practices their art their literature their religion65 practices that enable us to imaginatively read into animals expectations that originate in the human the other than an animal Given her critique of the rights framework and her emphasis on compassion not standing as fundamental to justice it may come as a surprise that Diamond finds in the contemporary animal rights move ment a commitment to justice not available in the concept of mere animal welfare The welfarist view she writes is essentially that we should ease the burdens we impose on animals without getting off their backs without ceasing to impose burdens on them burdens that we impose because we can because they are in general helpless to resist us But the force of the animal rights movement comes from the sense of the profound injustice of thisa sense however that its dominant language of rights is not equipped to articulate But if we reject the opposition all too dominant in contemporary moral the ory of justice and compassion rights and pity what is revealed is a kind of pitilessness at the heart of welfarism a willingness to go ahead flesh and finitude with what we do to the vulnerable a willingness to go on subject ing them to our power because we can that is different not in struc ture but only in degree from what goes on in the animal research labs Willingness is indeed too weak a word she writes we will not give up a form of life resting on the oppression of others and the will to continue exercising power in such ways    is inseparable from the compassion we express in welfarismone that has nothing to do with the grounds of justice in embodiment vulnerability and finitude as Diamond conceives it66 Double Finitude or Taking Bioethics off Autopilot The originality and subtlety of Diamonds position lie in no small part then in her separation of the question of justice from the discourse of rightsand beyond that in her insistence that vulnerability and com passion are very much to the point of justice and in a profound sense lie at its very heart Diamonds nuanced thinking of these questions helps us to bring out more precisely the oddly disjunctive and muddled character of Nussbaums work that is created by how her chosen philo sophical approach forecloses and frustrates her altogether admirable attempt to move beyond the reduction of the problem of justice for nonhuman animals to interests that we find in utilitarianism and replace it with a broader view of capabilities and flourishing that takes an interest not just in pleasure and pain but in complex forms of life and functioning67 Both agree as Nussbaum puts it that the best reason to be against slavery torture and lifelong subordination is a reason of justice not an empirical calculation of total or average well being 343 Similarly Nussbaum like Diamond insists that the power of sympathetic imagining of the lives of nonhuman animals of the sort made available by literature but not only there is important and relevant to questions of moral judgment As she puts it imagining the lives of animals makes them real to us in a primary way as potential subjects of justice 355 It is entirely symptomatic in this regard how ever that while the force of literature for Diamond is its difference from philosophy its ability to confront propositional analytic thought with its own limitations even unnervingly so as in Hughess Six Young Men for Nussbaum literature serves as a kind of kinder gentler sup plement to analytic philosophys project of sentimental education stirring in us identifications empathetic responses and projections that may then be readily formalized in analytical propositions 411 As Harpham succinctly puts it In Nussbaum the specificity of litera ture as a discourse an object of professional study is almost altogether erased and replaced by a conception that treats it bluntly as moral phi losophy The aesthetic is made to serve the aims of culture and moral ity in a dedifferentiated unity rarely seen in the modern world And philosophical reading is thus calculated to extract maxims that could guide contemporary policy makers economists or jurists68 Similarly the change in philosophical approach that would seem to be required by Nussbaums attempt to honor the importance of sym pathetic imagining in questions of justicethe very impulses that drive her away from the thin accounts of utilitarianism and contrac tarianismis immediately foreclosed by her insistence that justice is the sphere of basic entitlements and that what is lacking in the con tract theory of a Rawls is the sense of the animal itself as an agent    a creature to whom something is due69 As Diamonds work suggests however such a philosophical approach only reinstates the reduction of questions of justice to questions of entitlement that the capabilities approach was meant to resist in the first place thus pushing apart the questions of justice and compassion in precisely the way that Nussbaum had resisted in both utilitarian and contractarian approachesa sepa ration made all the more acute by Nussbaums characteristically fuzzy insistence that on the one hand compassion overlaps with the sense of justice and a full allegiance to justice requires compassion for beings who suffer wrongfully but on the other compassion itself is too in determinate to capture our sense of what is wrong with the treatment of animals 337a wrong that must presumably be directed at their entitlements as rightsholding agents As Diamond would be the first to point out however what is indeterminate is not our compassion for the suffering of nonhuman animals but the idea that rights and en titlement bear anything other than a completely contingent relation ship derived from the historically and ideologically specific character of our juridical and political institutions and the picture of the subject of rights that they provide to the question of justice for nonhuman animals Or to put it slightly otherwise the idea that animals deserve flesh and finitude justice because they are moral agents and not just moral patients while perhaps problematic in its own right70 undercuts Nussbaums earlier assertion that the key link between humans and nonhuman animals as subjects of justice is not their agency but exactly the opposite their shared finitude as embodied vulnerable beings I would like to turn now to Jacques Derridas later work to pro vide an example of how the admirable impulses behind Nussbaums attempt to think the questions of justice and moral standing for non humans might motivate a very different view of what philosophy is eventuating in theoretical and methodological commitments that avoid not just the sort of problems we have just been discussing in Nussbaum but also limitations in Diamonds remarkable set of essays on these questions At first glance Derridas work seems quite consonant with Diamonds beginning with three main features First Derrida empha sizes like Diamond and like Nussbaum that the fundamental ethical bond we have with nonhuman animals resides in our shared finitude our vulnerability and mortality as fellow creatures a phrase he too invokes at key moments in his argument Second Derrida shares with Diamond against Nussbaum a certain understanding of what ethics is not propositionally deriving a set of rules for conduct that apply generically in all cases but confronting our exposure to a permanent condition in which to use Cavells phrase there is no way to settle our attitude Third Derrida also insists that crucial to both of these is to show as Diamond puts it in an earlier essay how philosophi cal misconceptions about language are connected with blindness to what our conceptual life is like71a blindness that is everywhere on display as I have been suggesting in Nussbaums attempt to think the animal question It is here I think that Diamonds approach as illuminating and searching as it is runs aground She is certainly right to suggest that our ability to think questions of bioethics depends fundamentally on the understandingindeed the theoryof language that we bring to it But what we find in her work I believe is an understanding of how language operates in a philosophical contextan understanding di rectly linked to her notion of human beingthat undermines her at tempt to open the question of justice beyond the human sphere alone I choose to focus on Derrida in this connection not just because of his wellknown theory of language as écriture dissemination trace and so on but also because we find in his recent work a gathering of terms around questions of justice and the living that is strikingly simi lar to what we have seen in Diamond It will come as a surprise to any reader I think that in his recent work on ethics and the question of nonhuman others Derrida returns to what serves in Singers work as the benchmark for the ethical consideration of animals namely the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Benthams contention that the relevant question here is not can they talk or can they reason but can they suffer For Derrida putting the question in this way changes everything because from Aristotle to Descartes from Descartes especially to Heidegger Levinas and Lacan posing the question of the animal in terms of either the capacity for thought or language de termines so many others concerning power or capability pouvoirs and attributes avoirs being able having the power to give to die to bury ones dead to dress to work to invent a technique72 What makes Benthams reframing of the problem so powerful is that now the ques tion is disturbed by a certain passivity It bears witness manifesting already as question the response that testifies to sufferance a pas sion a notbeingable What of the vulnerability felt on the basis of this inability he continues what is this nonpower at the heart of power    What right should be accorded it To what extent does it concern us It concerns us directly in fact for mortality resides there as the most radical means of thinking the finitude that we share with animals the mortality that belongs to the very finitude of life to the experience of compassion73 In Derrida as in Diamond the vulnerability and ultimately mor tality that we share with nonhuman animals and the compassion that they elicitwhat Diamond characterizes as the capacity to be harmed but also to be brought up short of inflicting harm on another by rec ognition of that capacity74lie at the core of the question of ethics not just mere kindness but justice For Derrida too what is still presented in such a problematic way as animal rights has a force quite indepen dent of the philosophical framework that usually accompanies it a force that involves a new experience of this compassion one that has opened anew the immense question of pathos of suffering pity and compassion and the place that has to be accorded to the interpretation flesh and finitude of this compassion to the sharing of this suffering among the living to the law ethics and politics that must be brought to bear upon this experience of compassion For Derrida then the point of the animal rights movement however flawed its articulation is to awaken us to our responsibilities and our obligations with respect to the living in general and precisely to this fundamental compassion that were we to take it seriously would have to change even the very basis    of the philosophical problematic of the animal75 For Derrida too the force of the animal rights movement out strips its own ability to articulate the questions it addresses questions that require an alternative conception of ethics to the rights tradition of analytical philosophy as it manifests itself in Singer and others For Singer as we have seen ethics means the application of what Derrida will elsewhere characterize as a calculable processin this case quite literallyof the utilitarian calculus that would tally up the interests of the particular beings in question in a given situation regardless of their species and would determine what counts as a just act by calculating which action maximizes the greatest good for the greatest number76 In doing so however Singer would reduce ethics to the very antithesis of ethics in Derridas sense because it would overleap what Derrida calls the ordeal of the undecidable which must be gone through by any decision worthy of the name A decision that didnt go through the ordeal of the undecidable would not be a free decision it would only be the programmable application or unfolding of a calculable process It might be legal it would not be just    And once the ordeal of the undecidable is past if that is possi ble the decision has again followed a rule or given itself a rule invented it or reinvented reaffirmed it it is no longer presently just fully just77 Ordeal is indeed the word we want here which is one reason Diamond rivets our attention more than once on Elizabeth Costellos rawness of nerves her sufferance of a responsibility that is both undeniable and unappeasable But what the rights view of ethics gives us insteadin either the Singer or Nussbaum versionis a deflection of this fully ethical ordeal one in which as Diamond puts it We would be given the presence or absence of moral community or thusandsuch degree or kind of moral community with animals78 Aside from thus being the antithesis of the ethical in Derridas sense such a calculation in its derivation of the shared interests of human and nonhuman animals would confuse what Diamond calls biological concepts with the con cepts proper to ethical thought This is what Derrida has in mind and more as we are about to see in his criticism of a biological continuism whose sinister connotations we are well aware of one that ignores the abyssal rupture between human and nonhuman forms of life but also within and between different forms of nonhuman animal life79 I have thus never believed he writes in some homogeneous continuity be tween what calls itself man and what he calls the animal80 At this juncture howeverand it is marked quite precisely by Derridas emphasis on what calls itself man and what he calls the animalsome fundamental differences between Derrida and Diamond begin to come into view not least in the articulation of this peculiar thing called the human We can get a sense of this differ ence by returning to the crucial role that vulnerability passivity and ultimately mortality play here for both Diamond and Derrida Let us recall Diamonds contention that we can come to think of killing an animal as in some circumstances at least similar to homicide but the significance of doing so depends on our already having an idea of what it is to kill a man81 Such an idea depends however on a relation to our own mortality that is rejected in Derridas work for Derrida con tra Diamond we never have an idea of what death is for usindeed death is precisely that which can never be for usand if we did then the ethical relation to the other would be immediately foreclosed This is clearest perhaps in Derridas reading of Heidegger and his concept of beingtowarddeath a concept that appearsbut only appearsto do justice to the passivity and finitude in which the ethical resides As Richard Beardsworth characterizes it for Derrida Heidegger appropriates the limit of death rather than returning it to the other of time The existential of beingtowardsdeath is consequently a being able pouvoiretre not the impossibility of all power whose passivity and vulnerability tie the self to the other in an ethical relation For Derrida on the other hand the impossibility of death for the ego confirms that the experience of finitude is one of radical passivity That the I cannot experience its own death means firstly that death is an immanence without horizon and secondly that time is that which exceeds my death that time is the flesh and finitude generation which precedes and follows me    Death is not a limit or horizon which recognized allows the ego to assume the there as in Heideggers beingtowarddeath it is something that never arrives in the egos time a notyet which confirms the priority of time over the ego marking accordingly the precedence of the other over the ego82 For Derrida then no relation to death can appear as such and if there is no as to death then the relation to death is always mediated through an other The as of death always appears through an others death for another 118 Beardsworth quotes Derrida The death of the other thus becomes    first always first Hence Beardsworth ar gues The recognition of the limit of death is always through another and is therefore at the same time the recognition of the other 118 And since the same is true of the other in relation to its own death what this means is that death impossibilizes existence and does so both for me and for the othersince death is no more for the other than it is for me 132 But it is paradoxically in just this impossibility that the possibility of justice resides the permanent call of the other in the face of which the subject always arrives too late Or to put this in somewhat different terms when Diamond affirms Costellos asser tion that I know what it is like to be a corpse Derridas response would be No you dont Only the other does and for that you are held hostage to use Levinass term in unappeasable ethical debt to the otherhence the otherwise odd idea of the gift of death to borrow from Derridas book by the same title To put it another way there is the suggestion in Diamond I think that imaginative and literary projection can somehow achieve in this instance what propositional syllogistic philosophy cannot achieve the nonconceptual nonlogical force of I know what its like to be a corpse but Derrida would see this too as a deflection of exposure exposure not just to mortal ity but also to a certain estranging operation of language to a second kind of finitude whose implications are enormous a point Ill return to in just a moment Such is the full resonance I think of Derridas recent contention with regard to Bentham that the word can pouvoir changes sense and sign here once one asks can they suffer The word wavers henceforth As soon as such a question is posed what counts is not only the idea of a transitivity or activity being able to speak to reason and so on the important thing is rather what impels it towards selfcontradiction something we will later relate back to autobiography83 What Derrida has in mind by the auto of autobiography is exemplified in Diamonds picture of the human in relation to ethics a picture in which as in Heidegger vulnerability passivity and finitude are recuperated as a beingable and a transitivity thus ontologizing and hypostatizing the split be tween the human and the otherall its othersacross which the human then reaches in an act of benevolence toward an other we imag ine is enough like us to warrant ethical treatment This only reinforces our suspicion that this human being is an essentially homogeneous and undifferentiated creature that is capable of a more or less transparent relationship to its own nature a relationship that it then expresses in and through language and may then extend benevolentlyor notto the nonhuman other This seems clear enough for example in Diamonds conten tion that the basis for justice lies in the human beings unreasoned expectation of good one that can if we are willing to attend to it stop us from inflicting harm not that it generally or even frequently happens she admits that people are thus inhibited84 We should recall here too her contention that the moral expectations of other human beings demand something of me as other than an animal and we do something like imaginatively read into animals something like such expectations when we think of vegetarianism as enabling us to meet a cows eyes85 In both these examples what the language of un reasoned good moral expectations and imaginatively read into unsuccessfully attempts to paper over is just how undifferentiated in relation to itself the human is in this account and how hypostatized its relations to the nonhuman other have become And matters are not helped any by her contention that our hearing the moral appeal of an animal is our hearing it speakas it werethe language of our fellow human beings86 There are two distinct issues here that we need to treat in turn The first of course is who exactly these fellow human beings are particularly if we have ruled out recourse to a biological concept as Diamond insists we should The secondand I will return to this in a momentis that even if we know who those fellows are what does it mean to say that there is a language proper to them and that the flesh and finitude animal must speak it if it is to be heard morally As for the first issue perhaps the most succinct way to make my point is simply to note the question of ethnocentrism that it begs a problem made all the more acute by Diamonds rejection of reference to biological or scientific co ordinates which might be viewed as independent of cultural determi nations For example she writes in Experimenting on Animals that if we want to know whether it is a good thing to treat dogs differently from other animals or cows differently from other animals it is absurd to think these are questions you should try to answer in some sort of totally general terms quite independently of seeing what particular human sense people have actually made out of the differ ences or similarities you are concerned with And this is not predict able If the Nuer for example had not actually made something hu manly remarkable out of giving cows a treatment quite different from that accorded other animals one could not know that singling cows out for special treatment could come to that    The modes of life and thought of our ancestors including their moral thinking have made the differences and similarities which are now available for us to use in our thinking and our emotions and decisions 351 Diamond may be right of course that we are never confronted with the existence of beings with discoverable empirical similarities and differences toward which we must act with the aid of general principles in such and such a way 351 But the problem is that there is nothing in Diamonds position to prevent us from carrying out ex actly the same sort of thought experiment here that we saw Cavalieri carry out earlier with Nozicks relational view of ethics To wit If the Germans for example had not actually made something humanly re markable out of giving Aryans a treatment quite different and so on Rather the only thing that does stop us is the extraordinarily hedged and finally empty contention that we may readily distinguish between attitudes toward racial difference species difference sexual difference and so on that are humanly valuable and those that arent 351 Of course one communitys humanly valuable is anothers humanly deplorable which is exactly the question with which the whole dis cussion began We seem then to be faced with a double bind How can we agree with Diamonds rejection of basing ethical questions on empirical data and biological concepts and at the same time distance her view from the pernicious ethnocentrism harbored by a relational or completely culturally referenced view of ethics Derrida captures the problem when he asks the same question about historicism which is structured by precisely the same dilemma can one criticize it in the name of something other than truth and science the value of universality omni temporality the infinity of value etc and what happens to science when the metaphysical value of truth has been put into question    How are the effects of science and truth to be reinscribed87 The prob lem here in other words is that the ethnocentric we might have been forcibly opened to take account of what lies beyond its comfort zone by appeal to the universality and omnitemporality of truth and science that exceeds any ethnocentric determination which is essentially how the appeal to empirical interests functions in animal rights philosophy but that seems no longer possible in any straight forward sense even if as Derrida remarks in the same note the point of raising this difficulty is not in order to return naively to a relativist or sceptical empiricism At this juncture then we suspect that a different way of thinking these problems may be necessary a way suggested but only suggested I think by Diamonds remarkable essay The Difficulty of Reality In her earlier work as I have been arguing we find something like the problem we see in Richard Rortys concept of belief that there is nothing in the relation of the ethnos to itself what we have made of the humananimal difference that installs alterity not outside the self enclosed subject of the ethnos who may then benevolently recognize or notsuch difference from a safe and secure ontological distance as it were but rather at its very core as the truth of the subject itself88 In this light part of the strength and attraction of Diamonds The Difficulty of Reality is precisely its weakness Where the emphasis in earlier essays was on our ability Derridas pouvoirs to extend imagi natively an apparently secure sense of the human to animals hearing them speak our language seeing in them expectations of us as other than animal here when we try to put into words the experience of the difficulty of reality that we find bodied forth in Ted Hughess Six Young Men or Coetzees The Lives of Animals the words fail us the words dont do what we are trying to get them to do The words make flesh and finitude separate me from something I very much want to see But the fact that the words are apparently too weak to do what I am demanding from them does not mean that the experience here of powerlessness has been shown to involve a kind of grammatical error 8 The force of this turn in Diamonds thought and its consequences for ethics can be extended and elaborated by means of Derridas work which would help us to articulate more fully the implications of the fact that there are two kinds of finitude here two kinds of passivity and vulnerability The first type physical vulnerability embodiment and eventually mortality is paradoxically made unavailable inappropri able to us by the very thing that makes it availablenamely a second type of passivity or not being able which is the finitude we experi ence in our subjection to a radically ahuman technicity or mechanicity of language a technicity that has profound consequences of course for what we too hastily think of as our concepts which are therefore in an important sense not ours at all And here then we arrive at the third point of contactbut also finally of differencebetween Diamond and Derrida that I noted ear lier how philosophical misconceptions about language are connected with blindness to what our conceptual life is like to use Diamonds phrase Derridas point would be not only that we dont have a concept of the human but also that its a good thing too because it is only on the strength of that weakness that we are able to avoid both horns of the dilemma brought to light in Diamonds work on the one hand the constant threat of ethnocentrism that a certain understanding of Wittgenstein flirts with we do what we do because of what we have made of the difference between humans and animals which keeps us from lapsing into biological continuism and on the other hand the mining for ethical universals that for philosophers such as Singer Regan and Nussbaum would attempt to counter this very threat by un covering first principles of ethics via the antiethnocentric autonomy of reason Derrida I am suggesting makes available a third way whose response would be that yes it is true that what we think of as the prin ciples of personhood morality and so on are inseparable from who we are from our discourse as a mode of life to put it in Wittgensteins terms But at the same time we are not we we are not that auto of autobiography as in Derridas The Autobiographical Animal that humanism gives to itself Rather we are always radically other already in or ahuman in our very beingnot just in the evolutionary biological and zoological fact of our physical vulnerability and mortal ity our mammalian existence but also in our subjection to and consti tution in the materiality and technicity of a language that is always on the scene before we are as a precondition of our subjectivity And this means that what he calls man what we call we always covers over a more radical not being able that makes our very conceptual life possible Even more important perhapsat least for the topic at handis that this passivity and subjection are shared by humans and nonhumans the moment they begin to interact and communicate by means of any semiotic system As Derrida puts it in a wellknown passage from the interview Eating Well If one reinscribes language in a network of possibilities that do not merely encompass it but mark it irreducibly from the inside everything changes I am thinking in particular of the mark in general of the trace of iterability of différance These possibilities or necessities without which there would be no language are themselves not only human    And what I am proposing here should allow us to take into account sci entific knowledge about the complexity of animal languages genetic coding all forms of marking within which socalled human language as original as it might be does not allow us to cut once and for all where we would in general like to cut89 At this juncture we can feel the full force of the difference between Derridas posthumanist position and how Diamonds humanism for mulates the relation between language ethics and the humananimal divide In Injustice and Animals she suggests that applying the con cept of justice to nonhuman animals is a response to communicative pressure which she defines thus In our various activities including our attempts to think about our lives and to make sense of what we ex perience and what we do we can use words well or badly The ways of speaking we find in response to activities and experiences may accom modate a merely superficial kind of meaning it or we may be able to find words that more fully render experiences or activities words that can be meant more fully90 But I think it is clear by now that the flesh and finitude distinction between superficially meaning it and really meaning it is bound to fare no better than Lacans distinction between really pre tending and just pretending to pretend that I discussed in the previous chapter In both cases what is at stake is the recovery and maintenance of the humanist subject as auto as a free consciousness present to the totality of the operation and of absolutely meaningful speech vouloirdire master of itself the teleological jurisdiction of an entire field whose organizing center remains intentionan intention that ex presses itself in the difference between pretending and pretending to pretend meaning something superficially and really meaning it91 It is over and against this recovery of humanism by what one might think of as the analyticwithapologies tradition that Derrida counterpoises what he characterizes as the corrupting and contami nating work of iterability the trace and so on92 As we saw in the opening chapter iterability does not signify simply    repeatability of the same but rather alterability of this same idealized in the singu larity of the event    It entails the necessity of thinking at once both the rule and the event concept and singularity as such it marks the essential and ideal limit of all pure idealization but not as the concept of nonideality as idealitys pure other 119 Like the undecidability that it generates iterability remains heterogeneous to rather than op posed to the order of the ideal the calculable and the pure Hence the form of ethical responsibility it entails is of another order altogether tending to each specific concatenation and iteration of rule and event to this particular undecidable 116 that is always a determinate oscil lation between possibilities one that takes place in strictly defined situations for example discursivesyntactical or rhetoricalbut also political ethical etc And as Derrida emphasizes such instances are pragmatically determined 148 Equally important for Derridaand this is crucial to situating the question of the animal in the broader context of posthumanism that we have been developingis that this second form of finitude this second kind of not being able renders uncertain and unstable unsettled in Cavells termsthe relationship of the human to itself because it renders unstable not just the boundary between human and animal but also between the organic and the mechanical or techno logical And here perhaps more clearly than anywhere else we can locate the most radical sense of Derridas posthumanism which finds the generative force of the nonliving at the origins of any living being human or animal who communicates and this in the broadest sense with another For these reasonsbecause of the estrangement of the the human from the auto that we give to ourselvesthe rela tion between the human and nonhuman animals is constantly opened anew and as it were permanently It is a wound if you will that can never be healed and is only further excavated and deepened by the very iterative technologies thinking writing speech that we use to try and suture it As Derrida summarizes it in a recent interview Beginning with Of Grammatology the elaboration of a new concept of the trace had to be extended to the entire field of the living or rather to the lifedeath relation beyond the anthropological limits of spoken language    At the time I stressed that the concepts of writing trace gramma or grapheme exceeded the opposition humannonhuman All the deconstructive gestures I have attempted to perform on philo sophical texts    consist in questioning the selfinterested misrecogni tion of what is called the Animal in general and the way in which these interpret the border between Man and Animal93 I stress this intercalation of the boundary between the biological organic and the mechanicaltechnical in relation to the infra and transhuman in no small part because Diamond herself is extremely interested in itmost conspicuously of course in her reading of the exposure of the photograph in Ted Hughess Six Young Men a technological archival artifact that confronts us with a shuddering awareness of death and life together94 Here however Diamond and Derrida pull us in different and perhaps even opposite directions for Diamond then glosses that exposure in terms of Costellos contention that I know what it is like to be a corpsea contention whose signifi cance she unpacks along the following lines in the final paragraph of her essay as a kind of rejoinder to pragmatism A language a form of thought cannot we may be told get things right or wrong fit or fail to fit reality it can only be more or less useful What I want to end with is not exactly a response to that it is to note how much that coming apart of thought and reality belongs to flesh and blood 12 Derridas point however is that this coming apart is not just of flesh and blood flesh and finitude constituted by a technicity with which it is prosthetically entwined a diacritical semiotic machine of language in the broadest sense that exceeds any and all presence including our own95 That it is in the broadest sense can be brought out by looking briefly at Derridas own confrontation with an exposure of the sort Diamond is interested in in this case an exposure of a piece of filma confrontation that will have considerable resonance for my discussion of the relationship between technology ethics and archive in the final chapter In a set of conversations with Bernard Stiegler published in English as Echographies of Television Derrida is concerned to differ with Roland Barthess suggestion in Camera Lucida that the photo is liter ally an emanation of the referent From a real body which was there proceed radiations that come to touch me I who am here    A kind of umbilical cord ties the body of the photographic thing to my gaze96 Instead Derrida insists that the modern possibility of the photograph joins in a single system death and the referent97 What he means by this rather enigmatic formulation is that a kind of spectrality inheres in the technology of the image because of its fundamental iterability Because we know that once it has been taken captured this image will be reproducible in our absence because we know this already we are already haunted by this future which brings our death Our dis appearance is already here    And this is what makes our experience so strange We are spectralized by the shot captured or possessed by spectrality in advance What has dare I say constantly haunted me in this logic of the spec ter is that it regularly exceeds all the oppositions between visible and invisible sensible and insensible A specter is both visible and invisible both phenomenal and nonphenomenal a trace that marks the present with its absence in advance 117 Derrida then tells a story that is haunting in its own right about his participation in Ken McMullens film Ghostdance where he impro vised a scene with the French actress Pascale Ogier in which he asks her And what about you do you believe in ghosts and she replies Yes now I do yes But imagine the experience I had Derrida says when two or three years later after Pascale Ogier had died I watched the film again in the United States at the request of students who wanted to discuss it with me Suddenly I saw Pascals face which I knew was a dead womans face come onto the screen She answered my questions Do you believe in ghosts Practically looking me in the eye she said to me again on the big screen Yes now I do yes Which now    I had the unnerving sense of the return of her specter the specter of her specter coming back to say to meto me here now Now    now    now that is to say in this dark room on another continent in another world here now yes believe me I believe in ghosts But at the same time I know that the first time Pascale said this already when she repeated this in my office already this spectrality was at work It was already there she was already saying this and she knew just as we know that even if she hadnt died in the interval one day it would be a dead woman who said I am dead or I am dead I know what Im talking about from where I am and Im watching you and this gaze remained dissymmetrical exchanged beyond all possible exchange    the other gaze met in an infinite night 120 So here is Elizabeth Costello again in a different light What I know is what a corpse cannot know that it is extinct that it knows nothing and will never know anything anymore For an instant before my whole structure of knowledge collapses in panic I am alive inside that contra diction dead and alive at the same time98 And here is Hughes again by the light of day that is also if we believe Derrida the light of night That mans not more alive whom you confront And shake by the hand see hale hear speak loud Than any of these six celluloid smiles are Nor prehistoric or fabulous beast more dead No thought so vivid as their smoking blood To regard this photograph might well dement Such contradictory permanent horrors here Smile from the single exposure and shoulder out Ones own body from its instant and heat In the end howeverand this is the final difference I want to mark between the CavellDiamond line and DerridaDerrida derives from this dementing force which bleeds together organism and machine living and dead prehistoric beast and ones own human instant and heat a kind of law or general economy the fundaments of which reach all the way back to his earliest work As he puts it in Echographies of Television and this descends directly from my earlier discussion of the flesh and finitude other this relationship constitutes an inheritance a genealogy of the law99 before the specter of the dead we are before the law with out any possible symmetry without reciprocity 120 The wholly otherand the dead person is the wholly otherwatches me concerns me and concerns or watches me while addressing to me without however answering me a prayer or an injunction an infinite demand which becomes the law for me it concerns me it regards me it addresses itself only to me at the same time that it exceeds me infi nitely and universally without my being able to exchange a glance with him or with her 12021 This is most obvious perhaps in the bestknown example of the spectral phenomenon that Derrida discussesShakespeares Hamlet where the relationship between inheritance law responsibility and spectrality is particularly even Oedipally pronounced But it would also seem to be the case with Hughess six young men in the photograph to whom we as the living feel a strange kind of responsibility and debt that is unsettling because unanswerable a point powerfully put in motion early in Diamonds essay In Derridas words the other comes before me 122 But we know from Derridas vantage that this responsibility cannot be metit is an infinite demandbecause of the law of iter ability itself He writes If the law of iterability    exceeds the inten tional structure that it renders possible and whose teleoarchaeology it limits if it is the law not merely of intentionality nor for that mat ter merely of the language or the writing of man then the question of the specificity of intentionality in this field without limits remains open100 In the face of the pragmatic and determinate forms of treat ment visited by humans upon nonhuman others in the face of the in justices noted by all the thinkers I have been discussing the question is how can I intend otherwise in actions that even if groundless and without purity or ideality of origin in a speaking or thinking subject nonetheless find their mark we might say in material effects on other living beings The issue here in other words is that if we do take seriously the pragmatic specificity of the relationship of iterability and intention then the first thing we are bound to notice is this human and at least some nonhuman animals may be in a phenomenological or ontologi cal sense more or less equally subjected to the exteriority and mate riality of the trace in a way that only the living can be that is what it means to be mortal to be fellow creatures to be subjected But what is not at all shared equally even if this is the case is the material disposition of that fact in practices and institutions whose effects bear very differently on human and nonhuman animalseffects Derrida himself is of course well aware of101 To put it another way humans and animals may share a fundamental nonpower at the heart of power may share a vulnerability and passivity without limit as fellow living beings but what they do not share equally is the power to ma terialize their misrecognition of their situation and to reproduce that materialization in institutions of exploitation and oppression whose effects are far from symmetrical in species terms From this vantage the issue is not only what should we dothe question of justice that Derrida would have us confront anew in each iteration without re course to calculation and ethical formulaebut also what will we do in the face of such challenges As David Wood puts it in his searching discussion of Derridas interview Eating Well there is a place for argument proof and dem onstration in philosophy but what this critical function opens onto are more or less motivated possibilities of responseand with regard to deconstruction specifically the ability to respond to what has not been adequately schematized formulated etc102 In Woods view those pos sibilities are evacuatedeviscerated we might sayby Derrida in two ways in Eating Well where he explicitly rejects vegetarianism as a more ethically responsible answer to the question How should one eat First Derrida frames the question in such a way as to incorpo rate and interiorize the actual eating of animals inside the symbolic eating of anything by anyone 30 so that the specific practice of eating animals becomes simply one more version of the larger symbolic struc ture by which Man in the Western philosophical tradition secures its transcendence through mastery of nature repression of the body everything that Derrida associates with the term carnophallogocen trism 30 In so doing Derrida evacuates the differencethe material alteritybetween different sacrificial structures and practices And the flesh and finitude result of this assimilation as Wood puts it is to the extent that in this culture sacrifice in the broad symbolic sense seems unavoidable there would seem to be little motivation for practical transformations of our engagement in sacrificial behavior 31 Second what he calls Derridas ambivalence toward vegetarian ism seems to be consonant with deconstructions idea of ethics as a practice of eternal vigilance one that cannot become some sort of alternative ethical seal of approval for vegetarianism or anything else But the problem here is that the avoidance of that widening path of resistance to violence that is vegetarianism could end up preserving against the temptations of progressive practical engagementthe kind of good conscience that too closely resembles a beautiful soul 32 In other words the eternal vigilance of deconstructive ethics which depends on always attending without the aid of predetermined judg ments and formulae to the specific iteration of event and rule here threatens to flipflop into the opposite of vigilance one whose good conscience resides in the security of its knowledge that there is no such thing as a good conscience To put it slightly otherwise Wood would force on Derrida the same distinction drawn earlier by Diamond Is Derrida merely an ani mal welfarist In the end do we find in Derridas work on ethics and the animal a reproductionto quote Diamond once againof a kind of pitilessness at the heart of welfarism a willingness to go ahead with what we do to the vulnerable a willingness to go on subjecting them to our power because we can because it suits us to do so a willingness that is inseparable from the compassion we express in welfarism103 What such a vantage point discloses is an essential tension in Derridas work on ethics between his insistence that we pay vigilant attention to the particular instance of decision of justice in all its thickness and heterogeneity without letting formulae and maxims do the work for us and a general law or economy of iterability that would render such decisions nonuniversalizable decisions whose foundations are local only while what is not local is the unavailability of such foundations from which to universalize This is not to say that Derridas position is without ethical force quite the contrary Regarding items six and seven in Contemporary Issues in Bioethics with which I began this chapter biomedical research and eugenics Derrida forcefully rivets our attentionas no one else in poststructuralist philosophy has doneon the infernal and mon strous conditions created for animals in product testing and factory farming by more and more audacious manipulations of the genome and other genetic forms of knowledge and the techniques of interven tion related to them that have reduced the animal to a mere vehicle for products and commodities104 Moreover as I noted in the opening pages he would call our attention to the process of codification in bioethics whereby the overdetermining material political and eco nomic relations between those in bioethics who formulate the rules and norms and those who legislate and enforce them are laid bare105 But Derridas position bears on the pragmatics of contemporary bioethics with which I began this chapter only at the extremes the pragmatic instance of judging particular cases on the one hand and the ordeal of the undecidable that attends such judgment and in principle makes universalization impossible while current bio ethics as a brand of policy studies and the edifice of law it takes for granted operate precisely in the middle zone abandoned by Derrida the maintenance or modification of generic universalizable norms in and through particular cases and the legal model of personhood with all its philosophical underpinnings that underwrites the process Derrida would have us pay attention to the specific instance of decision in a way foreclosed by the generality and logic of the law itself since the force of such specific instances for Derrida is in principle their ability to revolutionize or exceed the law itself their call for us to real ize that what is legal may not be just and vice versa Here one might readily think not just of issues regarding our treatment of animals such as xenotransplantation but also of issues such as assisted suicide the case of Terri Schiavo and the likeall of which would seem to depend on pragmatic particulars that obtain as it were beneath the level of the law and often create a jarring contradiction between what is legal and our sense of what is just At the other extreme Derridas general economy of iterability would prevent the generalization of such decisions taken in aggregate into a larger edifice or structurea new legal doctrine if you like and would highlight the differences and even the abyss between the intentionality that would attempt unilaterally to deploy such structures flesh and finitude and the material and archival force of such structures themselves What this means for bioethics in the pragmatic sense is that Derrida is of little use in enabling us to formulate new guidelines about particular surgical or experimental procedures that we could then generalize on behalf of more progressive policies But he is of immense use in forcing us to live with the fact that no matter how such policies are drawn the distinc tion between human and animal should be of no use in drawing them Animal Studies Disciplinarity and the PostHumanities What began in the early to mid1990s as a smattering of work in various fields on humananimal relations and their representation in various endeavorsliterary artistic scientifichas as we reach the end of the new millenniums first decade galvanized into a vibrant emergent field of interdisciplinary inquiry called animal studies or sometimes humananimal studies In what follows I want to sug gest that both rubrics are problematic in light of the broader context in which they must be confrontedthe context of posthumanism More specifically I hope to make it clear that the questions that oc cupy human animal studies can be addressed adequately only if we confront them on not just one level but two not just the level of con tent thematics and the object of knowledge the animal studied by animal studies but also the level of theoretical and methodological approach how animal studies studies the animal Just because we direct our attention to the study of nonhuman animals and even if we do so with the aim of exposing how they have been misunderstood and exploited that does not mean that we are not continuing to be humanistand therefore by definition anthropocentric Indeed one of the hallmarks of humanismand even more specifically that kind of humanism called liberalismis its penchant for that kind of plural ism in which the sphere of attention and consideration intellectual or ethical is broadened and extended to previously marginalized groups but without in the least destabilizing or throwing into radical question the schema of the human who undertakes such pluralization In that event pluralism becomes incorporation and the projects of humanism intellectually and liberalism politically are extended and indeed ex tended in a rather classic sort of way To put it this wayin terms of the ideological stakes of discipli narityis to signal that there are multiple contexts within which the animal studies question of animal studies disciplinarity and the humanities might be discussed had we world enough and timecontexts toward which I can only rapidly gesture here One of these would be the changing sta tus of the humanities themselvesa change sometimes described in the language of crisisin relation to what used to be called the public sphere and the more general questions of the humanities social cul tural and political role in a world that appears to need and value hu manistic knowledge less and less1 One might alsomoving outward to larger contextssituate this question in the context of the changing role and function of the university as an institution especially as that role has been reshaped by forces associated with the corporatization of social institutions generally2 And one might moreover explore both those issuesdisciplinary change and institutional changealong the lines cultivated by Alan Lius discussion of the humanities in terms of the broader context of knowledge work in The Laws of Cool 2004 Still farther afield one might ask after the role and status of animal stud ies in the context of growing attention to the biopolitical and to ques tions of biopower that derive at least from the work of the Frankfurt school and beyond that Marxs famous discussion of species being in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 wend their way through Michel Foucaults later work and receive contemporary attention from thinkers ranging from Giorgio Agamben and Roberto Esposito to Jacques Derrida and Judith Butler among others For surely the question of biopower radically changes our view of the animality of the human in ways marked for example by Agambens distinc tion between bios which marks the form or way of life proper to an individual or group and zoé which expresses the simple fact of liv ing common to all living beings3 For biopolitical theory the ani mality of the human becomes a central problemperhaps the central problemto be produced controlled or regulated for politics in its distinctly modern form Literary and Cultural Studies in the United States Historicism Theory and Disciplinarity I want to begin however with a more modest focus on the discipline in which I am housed literary and cultural studies where the relations animal studies between animal studies the humanities and its mission or missions and the problem of disciplinarity are being conjugated in an especially energetic and wideranging way In that context it is all the more im portant to note that the discipline itself has in recent years reached what feels to many like a crisis of coherence a disciplinary threshold of some sort4 The sharpest symptom perhaps is the schism that has been brewing for some time now to put it schematically between scholars committed primarily to matters of history and scholars com mitted primarily to matters of theory and in a different register the relation of form and meaning in the study of literature and culture And while historicism broadly speaking has no doubt ruled the day for some time now on the strength of the early momentum garnered by innovative works in New Historicism in fields such as early modern and romantic studies there are signs that this is changing in part be cause the dominant modes of historicism being practiced now seem to many a regression to the kind of old historicism that New Historicism itself sought to move beyond Critiques of the situation from across the intellectual and politi cal spectrum are not hard to find The romanticist Thomas Pfau for example is among the more strident critics though he might best be characterized as an intellectual historian Pfau observes that this more recent mode of historicism though it disavows the strong penchant for grand narrative    in favor of so many specialized microanalyses cannot achieve its recurrent quest for local transcendence to bor row Alan Lius famous formulation without underlying and largely unexamined ideological commitments of its ownan implicit frame work that Pfau pares down the following tacit assumptions 1 The Axiom of the Archive that specialized research understood at the recovery of previously overlooked materials and animal studies significance of contemporary critique arises from the primitive accu mulation of so many disaggregated voices and archival projects with the further assumption that critical knowledge will spontaneously arise from the openmarket interaction of presumptively equivalent indifferent perspectives 4 The Axiom of Retroactive Liberation or secularization that an in stitutional professional and transactional mode of critique will even tually liberate historical meanings from their alleged past entrapment in religious or ideological norms and values and in doing so will re store for us their temporarily missed yet always intended authentic secular core 5 The Axiom of Critique as a Guarantor of Historical Progress that the transactionalism of modern institutional knowledge effects a teleologi cal progression towards a hypostatized Liberal community envisioned as a wholly transparent inclusive tolerant and exhaustively informed Crucially though this telos can only be articulated in a language of permanent deferral and in what constitutes a diametrical reversal of Aristotelian thought is being defined by the absence of any specific norms or contents rather than by the practical acknowledgment of their suprapersonal authority5 Pfaus quarrel with this mode of historicism as you will have already gathered is not just methodologicalnot just for example with the selfimposed restriction of recent models of inquiry to tightly localized and circumscribed chronotypes biographically con ceived time spans the punctum of this or that local event dates of publication etc 7 It is also ideological insofar as such an approach ultimately reproduces a decisivealbeit unexamined and doubtful axiom that underwrites    the political and economic projects of clas sical Liberalism and their subsidiary rhetoric of emancipation prog ress growth and political rights 7 Given the extensive discussion in the last chapter it hardly needs saying that this linkage between methodology and ideology has particular resonance in the context of animal studies where the same concept of rightsnamely in the form of animal rightshas been crucial to the emergence and consolida tion of the very field that now is eager to move beyond that paradigm What also drops out in many manifestations of contemporary literary historicism if we believe Ellen Rooney Susan Wolfson and others who contributed to the special MLQ issue of 2000 on The animal studies New Formalism is the questionone might even say the very disciplinarityof reading and not just in the narrow sense of reading literary forms such as the sonnet or the novel As Rooney puts it The effects of the attenuation of the category of form include the reduc tion of every text to its ideological or historical context or to an exem plar of a prior theory content    and the generalization of reading asparaphrase which robs cultural and literary studies of the power to make any essential contribution to critical work already moving confidently ahead in history sociology anthropology and communica tions These are all disciplines that have long since mastered the art of readingassummary reading sans form6 Admittedly we would do well here to keep in mind Marjorie Levinsons reminder that it is useful in such cases to distinguish between new his toricism and new historicism7between many of the founding first generation texts of New Historicism by Stephen Greenblatt Jerome McGann and others which were she argues quite demonstrably concerned not just with the articulation of form and historical content but also with questions of the aesthetic and of pleasure 56061 and the work of those hapless followers and mere practitioners 560 as one critic puts it which treats the textany text be it poem novel Supreme Court ruling political speech or advertisementas merely a site for mining content an alibi sufficient to get the machinery of archaeology and archivechurning up and running 561 Surely Rooney is right that the real issue here is not to transcend the New Historicism poststructuralism cultural materialism or any of the other critical interventions marking literary studies in the late twentieth century 18its not about picking your favorite brand name and taking sides in other wordsbut to engage the question of disciplinarity in literary and cultural studies what they can contribute specifically that could not be handled just as well or better by other fields such as history or sociology or philosophy As she puts it for a critical reader bereft of the category of form the subject matter of lit erary and cultural analysis loses all standing as a theoretical object an object situated and at work in a critical or disciplinary field 1819 To raise the question of cultural studies in this context though only brings the problem into sharper focus for as Rooney points out animal studies that field is perhaps even more intractably caught than literary criti cism in the dilemma of defining its own proper form it is a welter of competing and even incompatible methods and a quasi disciplin ary form increasingly difficult to defend intellectually or politically 21 Indeed if we believe Tilottama Rajan cultural studies isnt part of the solution its part of the problem and like the historicism criti cized by Pfau it is one with identifiable ideological contours In Rajans view in fact cultural studies in the United States and North America the United Kingdom and Australia would require somewhat different analyses as she rightly animal studies observations on historicisms textasparaphrase by observing that the teleology of the new cultural studies under the guise of pluralism is of absolute selftransparency based on total communicability9 Cultural studies thus involves a repurposing of reading and thinking it is a pragmatic use of the humanities within a modular structure that appears to promote dissidence by its pluralism of content and identities but instead interpellates minority identities and localisms into a disciplinary complex 77 Thus for example Bhabhas concepts of alterity and migrancy rather than exerting a critical force that is radically heterogeneous toradically other thanthe liberal socius and its ruling protocols instead become recontained as pluralism by cultural studies normalizing ideological function for civil society Though civil society contains diverse subgroups it mediates their an tagonisms holding together different classes and interests by provid ing their members with recognition 76 And hence Rajan argues disciplines of slow thought committed to the nontransparency of these relationships become relegated to the margins of cultural studies symptomatically reflected in the turn away from poetry in literary and cultural studies as she shrewdly animal studies put an even finer point on itthe disciplinary hegemony of histori cism becomes nothing more or less than an exercise in the very pre sentism that historicists routinely lay at the doorstep of theory Indeed as Rooney observes one result of this lack of theoretical reflection by the dominant modes of historicism is that ironically enough they be come an unwitting echo of the earliest epoch of literary studies in that thematic analysis has become virtually the sole mode of formal analysis effectively at work in literary and cultural studies 28 Does this mean that there is no such thing as good histori cism Of course not as Levinsons careful distinction between new historicism and new historicism ought to make clear But it does mean that any historicism needs to confront the difference between historicity and historicismthat is to say the difference between the material institutional forces it is interested in and the modes and protocols of knowledge by which those materials are disciplined by which they are given form protocols that are by definition always already reductive not just in the strict epistemological sense of being selective but also in the empirical terms favored by historicism it self Indeed as none other than Franco Moretti has pointed out with regard to the project of literary history the majority of books dis appear foreverand majority actually misses the point if we set todays canon of nineteenthcentury British novels at two hundred titles which is a very high figure they would still be only about 05 percent of all published novels11 As Moretti animal studies of historicism in US literary and cultural studies is Marxist aesthetics Marxism grappled as no other contemporary body of thought has with precisely the questions that occupy literary and cultural historicists today particularly those who think of themselves as politically pro gressive namely the ideological and political function of culture in relation to economic infrastructures civil society and the relations of national and international contexts both geopolitical and economic as they bear on those questions13 This is not to say of course that figures such as Lukács Brecht Adorno Macherey Althusser Bloch Mannheim and others agreed at all on these issues Rather it is to remind us that the dubious practices of paraphrase reading for theme privileging the biographical and the generational chronotope the local context and so onand most importantly the instrumentalization of cultural forms as a mere vehicle for sociological or historical content that plague contemporary literary and cultural studies received inten sive scrutiny for decades in Marxist theorys debates over socialist real ism the ideological and political character of modernism and its formal experimentation as in the socalled BrechtLukács debate and much else besides And yet this remarkable body of work does not inform the landscape of current historicist practice in literary and cultural studies in the United States in any fundamental way Rajan sees the role of theory in the current context in rather dif ferent terms but likewise finds its signal value in denaturalizing dis ciplinary formations its ability to exercise a destabilizing antisystemic force in relation to disciplinarity in generala kind of asystasy to use a term she borrows from Schelling14 that unworks the Idealism and imperialism of any practice including theory itself 80 She finds this project of an asystatic deployment of fields of knowledge to un settle one another inherited and sustained by Michel Foucault in his early work but in a historically specific articulation one that prevents the gesture toward theory from becoming a master discourse As she reminds us The Order of Things denaturalizes and decenters disciplines not only in response to the crisis of the university as a culture and insti tution in late 1960s France one whose disciplinary forms hamstrung its ability to respond to the social crisis at hand it also culminates in a criticism of the human sciences the modern academys bridging of the humanities and social sciences under the form of a corporate animal studies merger 81 Foucaults analysis of the emergence of the disciplines is in a word antiideological What Are Disciplines I want to supplement Rajans account of Foucaults work on discipli narity with John Rajchmans to make a slightly different point one whose stakes will only gradually come into focus in the remainder of the chapter A crucial emphasis of Foucaults early work is this If we take the question of disciplinarity seriously we have to first of all admit that disciplines do not derive their constitutive protocols from their objects of attention Quite the contrary disciplines constitute their objects through their practices theoretical commitments and methodological proceduresand they do so quite selectively This is a seemingly simple point but it is one as we shall see with farreaching consequences From the early 1960s to the late 1970s in The Order of Things The Archaeology of Knowledge and Discipline and Punish Foucault undertakes what Rajchman calls nominalist historiesnot histories of things but of the terms categories and techniques through which certain things become at certain times the focus of a whole configura tion of discussion and procedure15 He thus seeks to challenge the universal objective and progressive image of unified science inher ited from the Enlightenment and instead embarks on an attempt to discover an irreducible plurality of territories and objects of knowl edge characterized by anonymous tacit procedures an account that emphasizes the relative autonomy of discourses 53 Two further and very important consequences flow from this commitment First this means that there is no such thing as society as a whole 55 since the idea of a whole and universal society has now been dis persed into a range of different practices discourses and disciplines 59 Secondsince one of Foucaults great objects of analysis is the group of techniques terms and categories that concern the subject this means that Foucaults work continues and indeed intensifies twentiethcentury challenges such as Heideggers or Wittgensteins to the postCartesian philosophy of the subject 52 In scrutiniz ing the various kinds of systems through which people have come animal studies to identify themselves as subjects Foucault in short undertakes a trenchant posthumanism on the terrain of the subject to match his antiuniversalism in the domain of the object16 We can extend and sharpen Foucaults account of disciplinary for mations with Niklas Luhmanns more recent work on social systems In doing so I hope to make some headway on what James Chandler has recently characterized as the need to rearticulate the disciplinary system after three decades of add on fields and programs To do so Chandler suggests we must work toward a better understanding of how the scheme of the disciplines might be said to compose a system a project that he likewise finds powerfully initiated in Foucaults work17 Like Foucault Luhmann does not make individuals the fundamental constitutive elements of society like Foucault he is therefore suspi cious of the universalist vocation of the intellectual18not because as in Foucault such an understanding would mitigate against our capacity to find alternatives to the particular forms of discourse that define us by uncovering the particularity and contingency of our knowledge and our practices 60 but because for Luhmann such universalism desirable though it may be is actually impossible under modernity now understood as a process of functional differentia tion For Luhmann as for Foucault then society as a whole cannot be said to existnor can by extension the public sphere in anything like the classical sensebut what Luhmann is able to articulate more clearly and at the same time more radically is how these twin claims no social holism no universal intellectual do not amount to reject ing science as such or criticizing all rational discourse 59 Rather it means for Luhmann that the form of rationality itself under modernity is paradoxicaland paradoxical in ways that produce precisely what Rajan calls the asystasy in and through which disciplines destabilize and expose each other Now it may seem odd to invoke systems theory in this context given that both Pfau and Rajan despite their vast intellectual differ ences think of the idea of system and its companion idea informa tion as the apotheosis of everything their accounts of disciplinarity aim to critique19 This is so I think because both are operating with a concept of system and of adjacent terms such as information that is markedly out of date one that would apply to the firstorder systems animal studies theory of the 1950s Norbert Wiener for example but not to the work in secondorder systems theory of Maturana and Varela Heinz von Foerster Luhmann and others Indeed for these thinkers the concept of system might best be described to use a concept from Adorno to which both Pfau and Rajan would be amenable as an effort to think detotalized totality In fact as Dirk Baecker puts it in a passage I in voked in the opening chapter systems theory after the secondorder turn may best be understood as an attempt to do away with any usual notion of system the theory in a way being the deconstruction of its central term20 To put it this wayand I will amplify the point in chapters 8 through 10is simply to remember why Luhmanns work is particularly interested in the core problematic of romanticism for mulated by Kant and Hegel that occupies both Pfau and Rajan21a problematic it attempts to redescribe in a context well articulated by Derridas observation that the critique of historicism in all its forms seems to me indispensable    The issue would be can one criticize historicism in the name of some thing other than truth and science the value of universality omni temporality the infinity of value etc and what happens to science when the metaphysical value of truth has been put into question etc How are the effects of science and of truth to be reinscribed22 This is precisely the project I would argue that Luhmann undertakes in his later work which becomes more and more philosophical if you like in both of the senses invoked by Pfau and Rajan as a universalizing discourse Pfau that retotalizes differentiation seriality specialization and so on in terms of a kind of normativity and systematicity produced by modernity as fundamentally a form of functional differentiation and as a theory of the contingency and constructedness of knowledge that detotalizes philosophys idealism and imperialism in the terms de scribed by Rajan Hans Georg Moeller summarizes this quite well Luhmanns relation to philosophy can    be compared to Hegels rela tion to religion as expressed in the Phenomenology of Spirit For Hegel religion was with respect to its highest purpose a thing of the past    Neither its semantics nor its general structure could be fully accepted any longer    Its essence had to be expressed in a more selfreflective way in a language and in a form that represented a higher understanding23 animal studies Similarly for Luhmann philosophy had become with respect to its highest purpose a thing of the past and so what Luhmann unabash edly calls a supertheory of society a theory of universal relevance can no longer be housed in philosophy given philosophys disciplinary norms and protocols24 Hegels Aufhebung from religion to philosophy now becomes Luhmanns from philosophy to theoryand this move ment is driven as Luhmann repeatedly insists by historical forces Like Hegels scheme Moeller writes Luhmanns claims to be thor oughly conceptualized and to return to its beginningin other words a coherent whole instead of a linear argument25 Unlike Hegels how ever Luhmanns theory acknowledges its own contingencythat is it acknowledges its modernity that it is itself a product of functional differentiation Or as Moeller observes What a supertheory says has to make general sense to it But this sense itself is not general it is con tingent on the theory that is constructing this horizon of sense in the first place26 With this background in mind we can now move to investi gate in more detail Luhmanns radicalization of the analysis of disci plinarity carried out in Foucaults early workone made possible by Luhmanns crucial turn in his middle and late work to the theory of autopoiesis as key to understanding social systems As we saw in the opening chapter Luhmann appropriates the concept from the work in biology of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to make sense of the seemingly paradoxical fact that systems are both open and closed to exist and reproduce themselves they must maintain their boundar ies and integrity through a process of selfreferential closure and it is only on the basis of this closure that they can then engage in struc tural coupling with their environment27 Like neurophysiological au topoietic systems their fundamental logic is recursive they use their own outputs as inputs in an ongoing process of selfmaking or self production and they constantly reproduce the elements that in turn produce them In Luhmanns scheme disciplinary formations would strictly speaking be viewed as elements of the social system called education but I believe they may be profitably thought of as subsystems that fol low the same systemic logic which both produce and depend on their own elements for their autopoiesis journals conferences research animal studies groups protocols of advancement and recognition etc From this vantage disciplines would deploy the distinction that is fundamental to all systemsthe distinction systemenvironmentbut would articulate it in their own specific form thus and this is a basic postu late of systems theory using it to reduce and process the overwhelm ing complexity of an environment that is by definition always already exponentially more complex than any particular system itself As we saw earlier this selectivity does not however indicate solipsism Quite the contrary for as Luhmann puts it in Social Systems selfreferential closure does not contradict the systems openness to the environment Instead in the selfreferential mode of operation closure is a form of broadening possible environmental contacts closure increases by constituting elements more capable of being determined the complex ity of the environment that is possible for the system 37 As we saw in chapter 1 the adaptive pressure to develop a highly selective codea pressure generated by the systems inferiority in complexity in comparison with the environmentleads in turn to an increasing internal differentiation within the system itself The sys temenvironment distinction is then repeated internally in the system so that for example the entire legal system now becomes the environ ment for the various legal subsystems which must themselves respond to or achieve resonance with the broader changes in the legal sys tem itself In building up their own internal complexity through in creased internal differentiation systems are able to enhance their abil ity to respond to a rapidly changing environment by in a sense slowing it down Increased selectivity buys time But in doing soin increasing their environmental resonance by building up their own internal com plexity by simply doing what they dosocial systems create more complexity in the environment of other systems even as they try to reduce it for themselves 177 hence the nearly paradigmatic situation associated with postmodernity hypercomplexity28 For Luhmann then as we know from our earlier discussions all observations whether by the legal system the economic system or any other are contingent and selective constructions and reductions of an environment that cannot be grasped holistically or in any total izing fashion This means that there is no given environment out there that can be cognitively approached or represented in its total animal studies ity What this means is not only that all systems and all observations are selfreferential it also means that paradoxically the difference be tween selfreference and external reference or heteroreference is itself a product of selfreference in the same way that the outside of the environment is always the outside of a specific inside This fact how ever cannot be observed by the system that at the same time wants to use that distinction to carry out its operations That observation can only be made by a secondorder observer using a different code in this case education which likewise must remain blind to the paradoxi cal nature of its constitutive distinction which can only be disclosed by another observer and so on and so forth As Luhmann points out The designations that usually register this state of affairs are relativ ism conventionalism constructivism One can summarize the mean ing of these concepts in the thesis of a loss of reference But if this is to be taken as a again paradigmatic critique of postmodernity such a critique assumes a position of totalization that is by definition no longer available in the context of modernity understood as functional differ entiation This thesis marks their negative content Luhmann contin ues Its negativity however only arises in a historical comparison with the premises of ontological metaphysics with its religious safeguards its cosmos of essences and its normative concept of nature29 Several important consequences may now be drawn from Luhmanns analysis First as was already clear in Foucaults work dis ciplines take their specificity not from the objects of their attention but from the specific protocols of their discourses Foucault their commu nications and observations Luhmann Or as Luhmann puts it in some what different terms a first step toward the comprehension of moder nity therefore consists in the distinction between problems of reference and problems of truth30 The disarticulation of reference and truth thus helps us understand in turn a crucial second point how the object of disciplinary knowledge is not therefore lost under modernitys loss of reference but is rather in a very real sense greatly enhanced As Luhmann puts it in the introductory chapter to Social Systems One can now distinguish the systemenvironment difference as seen from the perspective of an observer eg that of a scientist from the systemenvironment difference as it is used within the system itself animal studies the observer in turn being conceivable himself only as a selfreferential system Reflexive relationships of this type dont just revolutionize the classical subjectobject epistemology    they also produce a very much more complex understanding of their objects via a very much more complex theory design 9 In a process that Luhmann calls semantic overburdening the system being observed is covered over with a procedure of reproduc ing and increasing its complexity that is impossible for it In its analysis science uses conceptual abstractions that do not do justice to the ob served systems concrete knowledge of its milieu or to its ongoing self experience On the basis of such reductionsand this is what justifies themmore complexity becomes visible than is accessible to the ob served system itself    In this sense it overburdens its objects self referential order    This overburdening is immanent in every observa tion 56 To put it another way it is not just unavoidable but crucial and immensely productive to keep open the difference between first and secondorder observation to insist on a nonreductive relation of prob lems of reference and problems of truth to remember with Maturana that the internal mechanisms of an observed phenomenon and a second order observation of them intrinsically take place in independent and non intersecting phenomenal domains31 All observations then may be carried out only on the basis of selfreferential closure but that closure because it produces both environmental complexity and semantic overburden ing produces more possibilities for connection more openness This analysis helps us understand in turn a third crucial point that disciplinary differentiation or specialization is not something to be lamented avoided or overcome rather universalization can be achieved only through specification32 This is the tenor in which I would like to hear Immanuel Wallerstein and his coauthors in the recent report Open the Social Sciences when they write The claim to universality however qualified    is inherent in the jus tification of all academic disciplines That is part of the requirement for their institutionalization The justification may be made on moral prac tical aesthetic or political grounds or some combination thereof but all institutionalized knowledge proceeds on the presumption that the lessons of the case at hand have significant bearing on the next case and that the list of potential cases is for all practical purposes endless33 animal studies When Wallerstein and his coauthors say universalizing the read ing I want to suggest is not totalizing which is likely Wallersteins own but the sense voiced in Rajchmans reading of Foucault when he suggests that history doesnt exist for Foucaultnot because its not real but because there is no one thing all our histories are about even though there may seem nothing about which we cannot write a history34 Fourth and finally given everything we have just said it is clear that just as disciplinary formations are not constituted by objects but by communications Foucaults discourses neither are they consti tuted by persons For Luhmannand this seems less counterintuitive after revisiting Foucaultthe fundamental elements of social systems are not people but communications In fact as Dietrich Schwanitz suggests The individual human being belongs to each of these func tionally differentiated subsystems for only short periods of time with only limited aspects of his person depending on his respective role as a voter pupil reader patient or litigant It is his fundamental exclu sion from society that allows the occasional reentry of the individual under particular circumstances    Modern society develops a seman tics of individuality that regards the individual as alien unfamiliar unpredictable and free35 This means we can say that people can participate in interdisciplinarity even if disciplines cant only if we are willing to give up the traditional notion of person Only that is if we become posthumanist Locating the Animal of Animal Studies or Posthumanism So how does all of this affect our view of animal studies in relation to the question of disciplinarity especially the disciplinarity of literary and cultural studies In my view it means that we should not try to imagine some superinterdiscipline called animal studies an understandable desire of course for all who work on cultural studies of nonhuman animals but rather recognize that it is only in and through our disci plinary specificity that we have something specific and irreplaceable to contribute to this question of the animal that has recently captured the attention of so many different disciplines not something accurate to contribute but something specific and there is a world of difference animal studies between those two claims What we need then is not interdisciplin arity but multidisciplinarity or perhaps transdisciplinaritybut a trans disciplinarity understood not to take one recent formulation as a critical evaluation of terms concepts and methods that transgresses disciplinary boundaries as a means to a higher level of reflexivity one that accepts the task of making itself transparent by thematiz ing the conditions of its own speech Rather we need to understand transdisciplinarity as a kind of distributed reflexivity necessitated as we have just seen by the fact that by definition no discourse no dis cipline can make transparent the conditions of its own observations36 In this sense transdisciplinarity means a distributed network of first and secondorder observers disciplines that precisely by doing what they do call into questionand are called into question by other disciplinary formations Such is the case as we saw in the last chapter in Cora Diamonds suggestion that literature confronts phi losophy with the degree to which philosophys characteristic modes of thinking about our moral responsibilities to animals are in fact evasions or deflections of a traumatic question that in some profound sense defies thoughta trauma that philosophy attempts to mitigate by turning it into a problem of propositional argumentation Or to take another example as I argued in chapter 2 literary studies has an important role to play in showing how the theory of language typically relied on in cognitive scienceand how that theory is typically related to questions of consciousness and cognitionsmuggles back into the category of subjectivity the very Cartesianism that cognitive science says it wants to overcome by means of its resolutely functional mode of analysis37 To say that an object of study will actually be enriched by the ongoing differentiation of disciplines is not however to invoke a tepid pluralismfar from it As Luhmann points outand here he defines in a nutshell the incoherent epistemological and ideological core of much work in contemporary cultural studiesthe laziest of all com promises is to agree on pluralism This both begins and avoids the deconstruction of the distinction between subject and object We con cede to each subject its own way of seeing its own worldview its own interpretation as with the reader of Wolfgang Iser but only in a frame work that at the same time allows for the objective world text and animal studies so forth38 Instead a better way to imagine some ever more complete or thorough representation of nonhuman animals via interdisciplinary practice is to recognize as I have been suggesting that the enrich ment of the object of study via semantic overburdening can only happen by means of disciplinarity and its differences This may be what is falsely called relativism but it is also what under the conditions of modernity is called knowledge Crucial to a posthumanist understanding of disciplinarity then and to posthumanism in general I would argueis the fundamental principle of openness from closure that Luhmanns work helps us theorize that taking seriously the phenomena of selfreference and au topoietic closure in disciplinary systems leads not to solipsism but quite the contrary to the ability for the system to increase environmental contacts and in the process produce more environmental complexity for other systems which in turn challenges other disciplines to change and evolve if they want to remain resonant with their changing envi ronment This marks an entirely differentbecause posthumanist valence from a fundamental assumption endemic to many contempo rary discussions of interdisciplinarity that even if disciplines cant transcend disciplinary closure people can As one critic writes on behalf of interdisciplinarity and a fairly standard set of desires associated with it disciplinary practice becomes a productive rather than a reproduc tive environment when in the spirit of critical reflection meanings and values of traditional pedagogy can be scrutinized    The inter subjectivity of meaning can be exposed he continues and educational institutions the classroom the discipline and the university can be seen to construct and condition knowledge In this way literary study as the study of textuality    reveals the epistemological structures that organize how we know how our knowledge gets transmitted and ac cepted and why and how students receive it39 But as Foucault would surely be the first to point outand here he would follow in the footsteps of his teacher Louis Althussers cri tique of Antonio Gramscis humanismsuch a picture appealing as it may be relies on the fantasy of a subject who escapes the constitutive blindness that is the contingency and selectivity that in fact makes knowledge possible Critical reflection in other words names the ability to pick up and put down disciplinary discourses at will without animal studies being bound by them to master without being mastered by the fini tude of knowledgeall ironically enough in the services of ostensi bly identifying various forms of finitude that overdetermine disciplin ary practice In reinscribing the familiar figure of the human as the subjectofreflection such a view reproduces an entire set of assump tions and protocols that are not just intellectually but also ideologically specific as both Pfau and Rajan among many others have pointed out In so doing it constitutes the reverse of what I have been trying to derive from the FoucaultLuhmann account of disciplinarity not the openness from closure that results from taking the selfreference and autopoiesis of disciplinarity seriously but rather closure from openness or rather apparent openness in the reproduction of a liberal human ist subject who then on the basis of reflection undertakes various forms of pluralism More important for the topic at hand such a picture of critical consciousness and its ability to rise above disciplinary and discursive finitude actually closes off the human from the nonhuman and thus reinstates the humananimal divide in a far less visible but far more fundamental way while ostensibly gesturing but only gesturing be yond humanism itself40 And it is the status structure and tacitly gov erning set of assumptions of that form of subjectivityand not just the range of its content and its interests however putatively progressive multicultural or antianthropocentricthat must be fully examined To use Derridas terms it is a question as we saw in the last chapter of the precise nature of the auto of the autobiographical animal the concept of the human that the human falsely gives to itself to then enable its recognitionfrom a safe ontological distance as it were of the nonhuman other in a gesture of selfflattering benevolence wholly characteristic of liberal humanism As I argued in detail there equally important for understand ing the relationship of disciplinarity to subjectivity that I have been discussingand this is the point usually overlooked in Derridas later work on the question of the animalis that there are two kinds of fini tude here under which the man of the humanities labors and more over that the first type physical vulnerability embodiment and even tually mortality is paradoxically made unavailable inappropriable to us by the very thing that makes it available namely a second type of not animal studies being able a second type of finitude that we experience in our subjec tion to the radically ahuman technicity of language understood in the broadest sense of any semiotic system This last fact as we have seen has profound consequences for what we too hastily think of as our concepts our readings our histories which are therefore in an impor tant sense not ours at all If literary and cultural studies are interested in sign systems of all kinds in their formal material and semantic aspects as one would presume them to be then they must I am arguing con front the enormous implications of this fact for their disciplinarity What Derrida enables us to formulatebut so does Luhmann in a different registeris that yes it is true that what we think of as personhood knowledge and so on is inseparable from who we are from our culture discourses and disciplines but at the same time we are not we we are not that auto of autobiography that human ism gives to itself As we saw in the previous chapter equally im portant for the topic of animal studies is Derridas insistence that this second type of finitudethe estranging prostheticity and exteriority of communicationis shared by humans and nonhumans the moment they begin to respond to each other by means of any semiotic system in the most rudimentary sensean assertion also clearly shared by Luhmanns unequivocal postulate that problems of autopoietic self reference do not apply to humans or to consciousness or even to bio logical or organic systems alone41 In different registers and with different objectives then Derrida Luhmann and Foucault help us clarify the pointand the ethical stakes of the point if we believe Derridathat many of the confusions sur rounding the question of interdisciplinarity stem from the fact that we continue to think the question in terms of persons and a subject centered semantics that is precisely in terms of humanism The vir tue of paying attention to the thinkers I have been discussing is not only do they make it clear that disciplines arent persons they also make it clear that persons arent persons in the sense of the definition of person that humanism gives to itself And it is here at this precise juncture that animal studies becomes a subset of the larger problem atic of posthumanism All the foregoing helps to clarify I hope two crucial and often misunderstood aspects of posthumanism as I use the term first that it animal studies is not antihistorical but only antihistoricist in the sense I have outlined and second that it is not posthuman or antihuman but rather simply posthumanist As for the first as I have already suggested on the heels of Marjorie Levinsons useful distinction between new historicism and new historicism the distinction humanismposthumanism is com pletely asymmetrical in fact to the distinction historicismformalism To insist that the difference between historicity and historicism be rec ognized as we saw Franco Moretti suggesting earlier is simply to in sist that if the past is far more heterogeneous and complexfar more ahuman and strange as the Annales school heldthan the accounts of it we have inherited it is also true that the present from which those accounts issue as products of specific practices and protocols is hetero geneous to itself in ways actively repressed by the recasting of a vast historical cultural and anthropological field within the protocols of humanism and the subject of knowledge it reproduces in and through those protocols As for the second pointthat posthumanism is anti or post humanmy sense of posthumanism does not partake of the fantasy of the posthuman described by N Katherine Hayles which imagines a tri umphant transcendence of embodiment and privileges informational pattern over material instantiation so that embodiment in a biological substrate is seen as an accident of history rather than an inevitability of life42 On the contrary as Derridas point earlier suggests it requires us to attend to that thing called the human with greater specificity greater attention to its embodiment embeddedness and materiality and how these in turn shape and are shaped by consciousness mind and so on It allows us to pay proper attention with Maturana and Varela to the material embodied and evolutionary nature of intelligence and cognition in which language for example is no longer seen as it is in philosophical humanism as a wellnighmagical property that on tologically separates Homo sapiens from every other living creature Rather it may now be viewed as an essentially non or ahuman emer gence from an evolutionary processwhat Maturana and Varela call the emergence of linguistic domains from larger processes of social interaction and communication among animals including but not lim ited to Homo sapiens That radically ahuman evolutionary emergence in turn makes possible language proper and the characteristic modes animal studies of consciousness and mentation associated with it but remains tied as in body language kinesics and more general forms of symbolic semi ology to an evolutionary substrate that continues to express itself in human interaction43 And yet everything I have just said would not be possiblewould be literally unthinkablewithout readily identifiable models concepts terms and so on disciplinary developments in information theory cog nitive ethology semiology to name just a few that are distinctly mod ern disciplinary products with their own particular histories and devel opments of the sort described by Foucault in The Order of Things Thus we find ourselves in a strange but inescapable loop in which our abil ity to understandmore fully and more thickly than humanismthe human depends on posthumanist theoretical and methodological innovations that end up revealing to paraphrase Lyotard that the post human comes both after chronologically and before as its robust mate rial embodied and evolutionary condition of possibility the human of humanism44 What we find after humanism as it were is what we might call turning Adornos famous phrase upside down not the pre ponderance of the object but the preponderance of the subject What I want to locate here then is a second crucial and indeed determina tive dimension in which the question of posthumanism is central It is not just as Neil Badmington and others have rightly observed that the post of posthumanism does not and moreover cannot mark or make an absolute break from the legacy of humanism45 It also means that while we may share Hayless view that various visions and versions of the triumphantly disembodied posthuman such as Hans Moravecs continue to rely on indeed imperialize a liberal humanist view of the self46 we must also recognize that there are liberal humanist ways of engaging in this very critique Does this mean then that posthumanism as I am using the term is simply a thinly veiled synonym for systems theory or de construction Not at all as the signal impact of that discipline called science in the context of animal studies ought to make clear But it does mean as the quotation from Derridas Eating Well on scien tific knowledge earlier suggests that science though it appears to eschew a subjectcentered semantics can avoid its own form of ideal ism only if it confronts the fact as Luhmann puts it that science can animal studies no longer comprehend itself as a representation of the world as it is and must therefore retract its claim of instructing others about the world It achieves an exploration of possible constructions that can be inscribed in the world and in so doing function as forms47 This does not mean of course that the knowledge thereby produced is worthless or cannot have operational value on the contraryas Bruno Latour for instance would be the first to suggestit can have operational value and effectivity only because it is such a reduction of complexity This means in turn that the break between transcendental idealism and radical constructivism 67 recognizes the fact of polycontextur ality to use Gotthard Gunthers term that is that the distinctions trueuntrue and selfreferenceexternal reference are not only to be distinguished but also as Luhmann puts it are located at right an gles to each other They have no mutually unbalancing effects 6548 From this vantage then posthumanism can be defined quite specifically as the necessity for any discourse or critical procedure to take account of the constitutive and constitutively paradoxical nature of its own distinctions forms and proceduresand take account of them in ways that may be distinguished from the reflection and intro spection associated with the critical subject of humanism The post of posthumanism thus marks the space in which the one using those distinctions and forms is not the one who can reflect on their latencies and blind spots while at the same time deploying them That can only be done as we have already seen by another observer using a different set of distinctionsand that observer within the general economy of autopoiesis and iterability need not be human indeed from this van tage never was human It is only on this basis which is not strictly speaking a basis at all but a nonplace a form of difference that a firstorder observer the subject in humanist parlance is opened and unavoidably so to the alterity of the other not by taking thought or by benevolent reflection but by the very conditions of cognition and communication conditions that in their constitutive blindness gen erate the necessity of the other This is why even though animal studies may be viewed as in one sense just another field it is in the sense I have just described not just another field On the one hand it could certainly be seen as what James Chandler calls the latest incarnation of a subdisciplinary field animal studies one of a whole array of academic fields and practices that since the 1970s have come to be called studies gender studies race studies and cultural studies of course but also film studies media studies jazz studies the list is virtually endless49 But for the reasons I have been outlining I think we must also see animal studies as not just another in the long list of fillintheblank studies itemized by Chandler Its not just that I want to resist the homogenizing force of such a designation which suggests that what are radically different problems constituen cies and formations are somehow equivalent nor is it only because of all the reservations some of which I noted earlier that the designa tion studies invites Rather the point I want to emphasizeand it is one obscured by the generic moniker of studies which occludes the crucial link between the two forms of finitude we examined a moment ago that reside at the heart of animal studies in a uniquely determining wayis that one can engage in a humanist or a posthumanist practice of a discipline and that fact is crucial to what a discipline can contribute to the field of animal studies For example just because a historian devotes attention to the topic of nonhuman animalslets say the awful plight of horses used in com bat operations during World War Idoesnt mean that humanism and anthropocentrism arent being maintained and reproduced in his or her disciplinary practice insofar as the disciplinary subject doing the history remains isolated from the viral effects of the second form of finitude and all its implications that I discussed earlier And insofar as that is the case that disciplinary practice undermines on a second level what looks like an antianthropocentric endeavor because its form of disciplinary subjectivity is founded on a constitutive repression of a less visiblebut for that very reason all the more fundamentalbond between human and nonhuman animals as beings who not only live and die as embodied beings but also communicate with each other in and through a second form of finitude that encompasses the humananimal difference form ing a bond that is all the more powerful because it is unthinking and in a fundamental sense unthinkable So even thoughto return to our historian exampleyour concept of the disciplines external relations to its larger environment is posthumanist in taking seriously the exis tence of nonhuman subjects and the consequent compulsion to make the discipline respond to the question of nonhuman animals foisted on animal studies it by changes in the disciplines environment your internal disciplinar ity may remain humanist through and through We may now thento move toward a conclusionsuggest a more overarching schema in which such a procedure might be called humanist posthumanism locating itself at one corner of a plane in which the Y axis denotes external relations  humanismanthropo centrism and the X axis denotes internal disciplinarity  humanism anthropocentrism Such a schema is not meant to be exhaustive of course merely indicative nor does it preclude recognizing that the desirability of a given position in such a schema must be contextual ized I suggest for example that if you are interviewing with the local newspaper about animal overpopulation in your community and you want to win over readers to your point of view you would do well to gravitate toward the internal disciplinary discourse that character izes the humanist end of the spectrum In this view the designation humanist posthumanism would apply as well as I have argued else where to the Kantian animal rights philosophy of Tom Regan the utilitarian animal liberation position of Peter Singer or the capabilities approach of Martha Nussbaum in Frontiers of Justice50 Meanwhile at the diagonally opposed corner of this schema posthumanist human ism would consist of being posthumanist in internal disciplinarity but humanist in the continued external insistence on the ethical and broadly speaking ontological efficacy of the humananimal divide Hereto stay for the moment only with figures about whom I have writtenone might think of the work of a Richard Rorty or a Slavoj Žižek For example Rortys strident antifoundationalism his critique of both philosophical realism and idealism as shared forms of repre sentationalism his rejection of the view of philosophy as the mir ror of nature surely kicks the props out from under the humanist subject of knowledge in its disciplinary practice Yet Rortys liberalism finds in such a deconstruction of philosophical representationalism no charge to rethink the hierarchy of humananimal as animals remain excluded as anything but presumably derivative or indirect sub jects of justice from the liberal conversation about political ends to which philosophy for Rorty is clearly subordinated51 As for Žižek his wellknown attacks on liberal multiculturalism in general and on neopragmatism in particular which are surely right animal studies as far as they go would seem to separate him decisively from a figure such as Rorty52 Žižeks disciplinary antihumanism would be located not in his antifoundationalism but rather precisely in his attack on anti foundationalisms evasion of the more fundamental fact identified by Lacan of Truth as contingentnot as constructed or relative in the sense associated with neopragmatism but as the radical senseless ness of the Lacanian Real which as Lacan famously put it resists sym bolization absolutely53 And yet to realize as I have argued elsewhere that in Žižek the animal is always already simply a metonymy either for the Lacanian Real or in the case of pets for the Symbolic is to real ize that although Žižek maintains a resolutely antihumanist account of the relationship between thought psychic formations and language or the Symbolic he is nevertheless humanist and anthropocentric in his inability to rethink what I have called the distribution of subjectiv ity across species lines54 As for Foucault his account of disciplinarity and his own disciplinary practice would appear to be posthumanist for reasons I have already discussed at some length Yet Foucaults external relations to humanism are difficult to assess at this pointnot only be cause of some striking differences between his earlier work my focus Fourfold disciplinarity humanist versus posthumanist internal versus external INTERNAL DISCIPLINARITY RELATIONS EXTERNAL Posthumanist Humanism Humanist Humanism Posthumanist Posthumanism Humanist Posthumanism  HUMANISM  HUMANISM  HUMANISM Foucault Rorty Zizek Heidegger Rawls Habermas Derrida Luhmann Latour MaturanaVarela Haraway Ferry Nussbaum Regan Singer  HUMANISM ˇ ˇ animal studies here and his later investigations of the care of the self in which a certain humanism returns to the fore if we believe Žižek55 but also because we are just beginning to be able to understand the full implica tions of Foucaults concepts of biopower and biopolitics for transspecies relations As for the category of humanist humanism that perhaps needs little elaboration because nearly all our social and political institutions and most of our public intellectuals take such a formation for granted I might cite hereagain among those I have written aboutHabermas Rawls and Luc Ferry And that leaves posthumanist posthumanism which has to do with understandingand understanding the conse quences ofthe very redefinition of what humanistic knowledge is after the disciplinary subjectivity at its core the notion of the human that it gives to itself has been rewritten along the lines I have been exploring here in the work of Derrida and Luhmann and elsewhere in the work of Deleuze and Guattari Bruno Latour Donna Haraway and Maturana and Varela In short the external or ahuman forces that his toricists and formalists alike in literary and cultural studies presume to constitute the always already post of their posthumanism politi cal institutions economic infrastructures geopolitical and strategic configurations and events but also social institutions and conventions such as art forms and their genres and media modes of domesticity and intersubjectivity and the like must always be conjugated within a second kind of externality and ahumanitya second kind of finitude that as Derrida helps us see fatefully binds us to nonhuman being in general and within that to nonhuman animals as the very condition of possibility for what we know and for sharing it with another It is in other words a question of locating the animality of animal studies in this case I would wager where one might least expect it Animal Studies Disability Studies and Who Comes after the Subject Of the various contemporary fields of interdisciplinary cultural studies that emerged over the past decade two of the most philo sophically ambitious and ethically challenging are animal studies and disability studies Both are often taken to be the latest chapters in the academic assimilation of the socalled new social movements civil rights feminism environmentalism gay and lesbian activism and so on that have fundamentally reshaped the study of society and culture over the past thirty years or more As we saw in some detail in chapter 3 part of what makes animal studies significant and disability studies is no different in this respect is that it poses fun damental challenges as these earlier movements have to a model of subjectivity and experience drawn from the liberal justice tradition and its central concept of rights in which ethical standing and civic inclusion are predicated on rationality autonomy and agency That agency in turn is taken to be expressive of the intentionality of one who is a member of what Kant called the community of reasonable beingsan intentionality that is taken to be more or less transpar ent to the subject itself Part of my aim in this chapter is to extend the argument of chap ter 3 to the question of disability with an eye toward gleaning what ani mal studies and disability studies have to teach each other about who or what comes after the subject as it is modeled in liberal humanism1 Both animal studies and disability studies show us something about the limitations of this model and in doing so call on us to rethink ques tions of ethical and political responsibility within what I have been characterizing as a fundamentally posthumanist set of coordinates2 In the wake of this after new lines of empathy affinity and respect between different forms of life both human and nonhuman may be lear ning from temple gr andin realized in ways not accountable either philosophically or ethically by the basic coordinates of liberal humanism Both animal studies and disability studies have intersected in what has recently emerged as a small subfield of its own authors who claim that their condition has enabled for them a unique understand ing of nonhuman animals and how they experience the world The most famous of these is probably Monty Roberts the famed horse whisperer who was born with a severe form of color blindness called achromatopia that allows him to see only blacks whites and a remark ably subtle scale of grays3 For that very reason however he developed early in life a keen perception of movement that has allowed him to read the body language of horses with amazing subtlety and precision4 Then there is the case of Dawn PrinceHughes who claims that her ex perience with Aspergers syndrome enabled her to have an unusually keen understanding of the nuances of the social interactions and com munications of a group of zoo gorillas As with Monty Roberts this was crucial for the evolution of her own selfunderstanding enabling her to move from being a wild thing out of context living on the margins of society to completing a PhD in anthropology and eventu ally to becoming an author and editor Gorillas she says taught me how to be civilized5 And then there is the case I will be discussing here Temple Grandin who reflects on her life with autism in three books published over the past nineteen years Grandinan animal science PhD who has designed onethird of all the livestockhandling facilities in the United Statesinsists that her experience with autism and its specific characteristics the intensely visual rather than verbal quality of her mental life the acute sensitivity to tactile stimulation and so on has given her a special understanding of how nonhuman animals experi ence the world one that has enabled her to design animal holding and processing facilities that are far more humane for the animals involved I am less concerned with evaluating Grandins assessment of her own case and its broader implicationsan assessment that is often prob lematic in my viewthan with mobilizing her observations about her experience toward my own critical ends Grandins story was first brought to national attention by Oliver Sacks in an article published in the New Yorker in 19946 The opening lines of Sackss foreword to Grandins second book Thinking in Pictures gesture toward what makes her case so instructive for my purposes Sacks calls Grandins first book Emergence Labeled Autistic unprece dented and in a way unthinkable because there had never before been an inside narrative of autism unthinkable because it had been medical dogma for forty years or more that there was no inside no inner life in the autistic or that if there was it would be forever denied access or expression7 As we saw in chapter 2 that dogma is founded in no small part on the toorapid assimilation of the questions of subjectivity conscious ness and cognition to the question of language abilitya dogma that is perhaps even more entrenched in the humanities and social sciences than in areas such as medicine Indeed as many scholars have argued the shibboleth where there is reason there is a subject morphs in the twentieth century into where there is language there is a subject8 In this light the title of Grandins second bookThinking in Pictures would constitute an oxymoron even for some fairly sophisticated con temporary philosophers of consciousness and cognition such as our example in chapter 2 Daniel Dennett as she herself lear ning from temple gr andin objects that move suddenly Grandin observes Ive seen cattle that were handled in two identical facilities easily walk through one and balk in the other The only difference between the two facilities was their orientation to the sun 22 And not surprisingly cattle respond sharply to small visual stimuli that humans dont even registera length of chain dangling from a feedlot fence a reflection in a puddle of water on the runway to a dip vat a crumpled white plastic bottle rocking in the wind 143 Grandin insists in her most recent book Animals in Translation that being a visual thinker was the start of my career with animals    because animals are visual creatures too Animals are controlled by what they see When I say Im a visual thinker she continues I dont mean just that Im good at making architectural drawings and de signs    I actually think in pictures During my thinking process I have no words in my head at all 17 In fact she often characterizes her mental processes in terms of a videotape library or CDROM that she scans for specific images which then get languaged and narra tivized in a secondorder process My mind is like a web browser she writes in one article When I lecture the language is mostly down loaded out of memory from files that are like tape recordings I use slides or for many animals not the dominant one and on the other hand the opposed register of the technical and mechanical Temple Grandin as recording storage and playback device as she describes it I will ex plore in greater detail in chapter 7 this essentially prosthetic nature of the visual and its implications but for now I want simply to note that in Grandins story in other words visuality may be animal it may be technical but it is anything but humanall the more so paradoxi cally enough for being so accurate and acute A corollary of thisand I will return to this question in some detail in the next two chapters as wellis that what we think of as normal human visuality does not seeand it does not see that it does not see Here we should remember especially from chapter 1 how the theory of observation and its necessary blind spot as developed by Niklas Luhmann and others serves as a posthumanist rejoinder to hu manisms trope of visualityasmastery that I referenced a moment ago But we could also be more down to earth and simply note that this not seeing is crucial to the human beings and to any beings organization of an overwhelming flood of visual input into a field of meaning We might recall in this connection Grandins discussion of a well known set of experiments exploring what is called inattentional blind ness in humans Daniel Simons the head of the Visual Cognition Lab at the University of Illinois showed test subjects a videotape of a group of students in a hallway moving about and passing two basketballs to and fro and asked the test subjects to count the number of passes made After the tape has been rolling for a while a person a woman in a gorilla suit walks onto the screen faces the camera beats her chest with her fists and then leaves What is remarkable is that 50 percent of those watching the tape do not even register the person in the go rilla suit even when prompted later specifically about it Its not that they dont remember seeing it exactly its that they apparently never registered seeing it in the first place But the point I want to stress is that this blindness takes place because of an entire framework of so cially conditioned expectations about meaning and the visual field10 As Grandin summarizes it Its not that normal people dont see the lady dressed in a gorilla suit at all its that their brains screen her out before she reaches consciousness 65 Moreover research suggests as Grandin puts it that inattentional blindness works at a high level of lear ning from temple gr andin mental processing meaning that your brain does a lot of processing be fore it allows something into consciousness 66 What we have here then are two different kinds of notseeing The first is the transformation by normal subjects of an unstruc tured flood of sensory input into a semiotically organized visual field of meaning which itself depends not only on biological constraints particular the organism but also on an entire set of socialsymbolic conventions forms and expectations The second by contrast is Grandins abnormal hyperacute almost photographic visuality that does not organize and harmonize objects in the visual field in terms of reason literally their ratio but instead gets mired visually hiccup ping if you will in a heterogeneous flotsam of particularspuddles shocked with glare bright lengths of dangling chainnone of which becomes furniture for the eye as agent of ratio or logos We will examine in some detail in chapter 7 the nature of such a visual field in relation to questions of prostheticity and the filmic me dium but here I want to index it to what Jacques Derrida in Memoirs of the Blind calls the ruin of vision11 In Derridas terms it is the blind the disabled who see the truth of vision It is the blind who most readily understand that the core fantasy of humanisms trope of vision is to think that perceptual space is organized around and for the look ing subject that the pure point of the eye as agent of ratio and logos exhausts the field of the visible that the invisible is onlyindeed merelythat which has not yet been seen by a subject who is in prin ciple capable of seeing all Over and against thisas one might already guess by my discus sion of the spectral in relation to photography and film in chapter 3 Derrida argues that the invisible is not simply the opposite of vision not simply its negative image the visible in waiting already there but simply as yet unseen Ratherand this should retain considerable resonance for my critique in chapter 7 of a certain representationalist notion of vision in contemporary artspace is not essentially mas tered by livré a the look as Derrida puts it12 He elaborates the point in a difficult passage from Memoirs of the Blind the opening gestures of which have particular resonance for Grandins hypervisuality a visual registration of objects that is so detailed and acute that the viewed ob ject itself becomes strangely opaque In order to be absolutely foreign to the visible and even to    the pos sibility of the visible this invisibility would still inhabit the visible or rather it would come to haunt it to the point of being confused with it    The visible as such would be invisible not as visibility the phe nomenality or essence of the visible but as the singular body of the vis ible itself right on the visibleso that by emanation and as if it were secreting its own medium the visible would produce blindness    To be the other of the visible absolute invisibility must neither take place elsewhere nor constitute another visible that is something that does not yet appear or has already disappeared    This nonvisible does not describe a phenomenon that is present elsewhere that is latent imagi nary unconscious hidden or past it is a phenomenon whose in appearance is of another kind13 The invisible then remains heterogeneous to the visible a spatial ization of the visual as Derrida calls it that is quite obviously at work for example not only in the autistics blinding visuality but also in the radical asymmetries and heterogeneities among all the different lifeforms who seeand for that very reason do not seein specific ways because of their neurophysiological constraints After all does it make sense to say that a ringtailed lemur does not see the object of the bats echolocation That a starfish does not see the image in an in sects compound eye Moreover as Derrida observes in the context of philosophy and ethics from its first words on Metaphysics associates sight with knowledge but he insists that we must also know how to hear and to listen I might suggest somewhat playfully that we have to know how to shut our eyes in order to be better listeners14 This decentering of sight is all the more important because as he reminds usin a passage that has considerable resonance with his critique of the humanist subject as a creature of abilities and capabilities that we examined in the previous two chaptersthe modern dominance of the principle of reason had to go hand in hand with the interpretation of the essence of beings as objects an object present as representation Vorstellung an object placed and positioned before a subject This lat ter a man who says I an ego certain of itself thus ensures his own technical mastery over the totality of what is15 To reframe the question of the visual in this wayto cut it loose from its indexical relation to the human to reason and to the lear ning from temple gr andin representational mastery of space itself and set it adrift within the gen eralized animal sensorium as merely the equal of the dogs sense of smell or the horses sense of touch and in some contexts inferior to thoseis to appreciate more fully Derridas observation that a de hierarchization of the senses displaces what we call the real that which resists all appropriation16 And it provides a useful context for hear ing the philosophical as well as zoological resonance of Grandins at tention to the specificity and intensity of other forms of sensory experi ence For example she the sides of the chute against her At first she writes there were a few moments of sheer panic as I stiffened up and tried to pull away from the pressure    Five seconds later I felt a wave of relaxation and about thirty minutes later I asked Aunt Ann to release me For about an hour afterward I felt very calm and serene 63 The magnitude of the experience for Grandin is hard to exaggerate This was the first time she writes I ever felt really comfortable in my own skin 63 This extraordinary sensitivity to touch and pressure is a quite common phenomenon with autistics Grandin reports and even though the sense of touch is often compromised by excessive sensi tivity it can sometimes provide the most reliable information about the environment 65 In extreme cases autistics actually have severe problems locating the boundaries of their own bodies One patient in a book about her own famous case reports that she could only per ceive one part of her body at a time and had no sense of it as forming a whole unit and she tapped rhythmically and sometimes slapped herself to determine where her body boundaries were 66 In fact Grandin suggests that the wellknown behavior of some nonverbal au tistics of constantly tapping and touching things may be an effort to figure out where the boundaries are in their environment like a blind person tapping with a cane 66 The autistics body boundary problem is at the core of another remarkable moment in Thinking in Pictures which dramatizes in an es pecially powerful way many of the themes I have been discussing thus far Grandin was hired to redesign an extremely cruel system used for the kosher slaughter of cattle replacing it with a chute that would gen tly hold the animal in a standing position while the rabbi performed the final deed It worked best when I operated the hydraulic levers unconsciously like using my legs for walking she writes I had to force myself to relax and just allow the restrainer to become part of my body    Through the machine I reached out and held the animal When I held his head in the yoke I imagined placing my hands on his forehead and under his chin and gently easing him into position Body boundaries seemed to disappear    The parts of the apparatus that held the animal felt as if they were an extension of my own body similar to the phantom limb effect    During this intense period of lear ning from temple gr andin concentration I no longer heard noise from the plant machinery    Everything seemed quiet and serene It was almost a religious experi ence    I was able to look at each animal to hold him gently and make him as comfortable as possible during the last moments of his life    A new door had been opened It felt like walking on water 4142 Now many things could be said about this passage18 but for the mo ment I would simply like to draw our attention to how here disability becomes the positive indeed enabling condition for a powerful experi ence by Grandin that crosses the lines not only of species difference but also of the organic and inorganic the biological and mechanical In a kind of dramatization of the category meltdowns identified ca nonically in Donna Haraways Cyborg Manifesto disability here positively makes a mess of the conceptual and ontological coordinates that Grandins rendering of the passage surely reinstates rhetorically on another level This realizationthat what we traditionally think of as disability can be a powerful and unique form of ablednessis a fundamental as sumption for recent work in disability studies19 Here however I want to interpret the significance of this moment in Grandins work and her case in general in a way that diverges from some of the dominant paradigms of recent disability studies At first blush the most obvious way for animal studies and disability studies to make common cause might seem to be within a shared liberal democratic framework which as philosopher Luc Ferry puts it counts on the progress of the equality of conditions to gradually increase the sphere of legal rights and ethical recognition In this viewand this is essentially the procedure of Martha Nussbaums Frontiers of Justice discussed in chap ter 3nonhuman animals and the disabled would be seen as simply the latest traditionally marginalized groups to have ethical and legal enfranchisement wholly or partially extended to them in an expand ing democratic context that entails what Nancy Fraser has called the politics of recognition20 But a fundamental problem with the liberal humanist model is not so much what it wants as the price it pays for what it wants that in its attempt to recognize the uniqueness of the other it reinstates the normative model of subjectivity that it insists is the problem in the first place I am not suggesting that working to liberalize the interpreta time or that lobbying to upgrade animal cruelty prosecutions from misdemeanor to felony status is a bad thing What I am suggesting is that these pragmatic pursuits are forced to work within the purview of a liberal humanism in philosophy politics and law that is bound by a historically and ideologically specific set of coordinates that because of that very boundedness allow one to achieve certain pragmatic gains in the short run but at the price of a radical foreshortening of a more ambitious and more profound ethical project a new and more inclusive form of ethical pluralism that it is our charge now to frame That proj ect would think the ethical force of disability and nonhuman subjectiv ity as something other than merely an expansion of the liberal human ist ethnos to ever newer populations as merely the next room added onto the increasingly opulent and globalizing house of what Richard Rorty has called the rich North Atlantic bourgeois democracies21 Derrida is especially forceful on this point in a recent interview on what he has called the question of the socalled animal which we explored in chapter 3 For the moment he suggests we ought to limit ourselves to working out the rules of law droit such as they exist But it will eventually be necessary to reconsider the history of this law and to understand that although animals cannot be placed under con cepts like citizen consciousness linked with speech    etc they are not for all that without a right Its the very concept of right that will have to be rethought Derridas point here is not just the obvious one that we cannot expect animals to be able to enter into an expressly juridical contract in which they would have duties in an exchange of recognized rights but ratherand more pointedlythat it is within this philosophicojuridical space that the modern violence against ani mals is practiced a violence that is at once contemporary with and indissociable from the discourse of human rights And from this van tage it makes perfect sense to conclude as Derrida does that how ever much sympathy I may have for a declaration of animals rights that would protect them from human violence it is nevertheless prefer able not to introduce this problematic concerning the relations between humans and animals into the existing juridical framework22 In disability studies the accent falls within a somewhat different vector of the liberal humanist framework To borrow the distinction lear ning from temple gr andin used by Paola Cavalieri which she borrows in turn from G J Warnock if animal rights discourse typically focuses on the status of the moral patient disability discourse tends to focus equally on the question of the moral agent As Cavalieri puts it If the moral agent is a being whose behavior may be subject to moral evaluation the moral patient is a being whose treatment may be subject to moral evaluation23 In disability discourse in other words the emphasis falls on the right of the disabled to subjectivity of a particular and circumscribed type sub jectivity as agency Against this background we can more fully appreciate Cora Kaplans observation in a recent collection on feminism and disability that human anomaly    continues to trouble the rhetoric of liberal individualism testing both its ethics of tolerance and its fetishization of autonomy and agency as conditions of human status and civic par ticipation Viewed from a long term perspective she continues the continuing debate about the rights of citizens and the price of increased agency for them is itself a legacy of liberalisms historically mixed messages about autonomy and social justice an ongoing paradox that remains as radically unresolved in the liberalisms that character ize latetwentiethcentury social democracies as it did in the classic liberalism of the nineteenth century24 What Kaplan calls the fetishization of agency endemic to the liberal concept of subjectivity is everywhere on display in a recently published collection of papers in PMLA from a highprofile conference at Emory University in March 2004 Disability Studies and the University In the introduction to the collection for example the authors trumpet the fact that we have the right to leave the hospital and travel the earth that people with disabilities are on the move after years of being probed and studied disabled people have begun themselves to probe and study and now emerge not as objects of study but as knowledge producers25 Here obviously enough the valences of the normal liberal subject active not passive subject not object of knowledge producer not prod uct and so on are called on to validate and legitimize the subjectivity of the disabled and the rallying cries are taken from the playbook of liberal citizenship access rights privileges participation This fetishization of agency in disability studies is understand able of course for all sorts of historical institutional and strategic reasons As participants in the Emory conference regularly note the trajectory of disability studies in the academy has been closely linked to the legal struggles of the disabled for basic needs such as access to public spaces human services and the like At the same time how ever it is interesting to see that some of the participants call for dis ability studies to move beyond the familiar theoretical models and or thodoxies of its past The activist and author Simi Linton for example argues that we need to grapple with the absence of an overarching term that subsumes everyonethe vector on which disability falls She suggestsafter the divisive strategies of the past which sought to stake out and hold on to the specificity of disability as a category which would resist seeing obesity for example as a disabilitythat we now need to find a new way of talking about the place of disabled people in the universe and to find the place of disability in some uni versal26 Similarly Lennard Davisone of the founding figures of disability studies in the academic humanities in the United States argues from a somewhat different vantage that the template of identity politics that characterized much early work in disability studies must be abandoned If disability studies is to remain viable he argues it will have to incorporate into its collective vision the kind of complexi ties with which postidentity theory is grappling27 What I have been suggesting of course is that Grandins ex ample of the relationship between disability and transspecies affinity directs us toward the possibility of taking up just this sort of project in a more profound and I think ultimately broadbased way a way that we can begin to understand in light of Derridas insistence that there is not one opposition between man and nonman there are between different organizational structures of the living being many fractures heterogeneities28 But underneath them all as we have seen in earlier chapters is a shared finitude a shared passivity to use Derridas term that runs directly counter to the liberal model of the subject as above all a creature of volition autonomy and agency of power or capability pouvoir and attributes avoirs being able having the power to give to die to bury ones dead to dress to work to invent a technique29 But the blockage in disability studies on this pointto return now to the papers from the Emory conferenceis remarkable to say lear ning from temple gr andin the least and that blockage short circuits the sort of project that both Linton and Davis in their different ways call for In fact in all the essays collected in the special PMLA issuethey make up 143 double column pagesnot once does the relationship between disability and transspecies affinity in this broader ethical project come up though Grandin herself is mentioned at least once The most pointed irony of all perhaps occurs in Rosemarie GarlandThomsons essay where she observes that although we value biodiversity in our environment we devalue physical and mental variety30 Here GarlandThomson would seem to echo Derridas contention that the problem with the phrase the Animal is that within the strict enclosure of this definite article    are all the living things that man does not recognize as his fellows his neighbors or his brothers And that is so in spite of the in finite space that separates the lizard from the dog the protozoon from the dolphin the shark from the lamb the parrot from the chimpan zee31 Similarlyor at least apparently soGarlandThomson argues for applying the vibrant logic of biodiversity to humans But even as she echoes Derridas reading of the significance of Benthams question can they suffer in her recognition that our bodies need care we all need assistance to live that our society emphatically denies vulner ability contingency and mortality32 she is unable to recognize that these ethical imperatives extend across species lines and bind us in our shared vulnerability to other living beings who think and feel live and die have needs and desires and require care just as we do Most ironic of all in this light is one example she offers of recent positive changes in images of disability in mass culture a magazine cover of a stereotypical tall slender female model dressed in evening gown for a night on the town but accompanied by a German Shepherd service dog She writes The juxtaposition of the elite body of a visually normative fashion model with the mark of disability forces the viewer to reconfigure assumptions about what constitutes the attractive the de sirable and the livable life 526 Yes but only at the expense of doing to nonhuman differents what normates have traditionally done to the disabled Now I want to stress that my point here is not to play the old est and most predictable trump card in the identity politics deckmy constituents are more marginalized and unrecognized than yours but rather to suggest that instead of seeing the nonhuman animal as liberal society and its values wouldnt we do better to imagine this example as an irreducibly different and unique form of subjectivity neither Homo sapiens nor Canis familiaris neither disabled nor nor mal but something else altogether a shared transspecies beinginthe world constituted by complex relations of trust respect dependence and communication as anyone who has ever trainedor relied ona service dog would be the first to tell you33 What I have in mind then is a different sort of project one that is consonant with the suggestion made by the editors of a recent col lection on disability and postmodernism that work associated with poststructuralism can contribute an enormous amount to the develop ment of inclusive societies which is surely as important as the challenge to the hegemony of normativism that is more typical of mainstream work in disability studies34 As they rightly argue existing theories of disabilityboth radical and mainstreamare no longer adequate    considering the range of impairments under the disability umbrella considering the different ways in which they impact on individuals and groups over their lifetime andparticularly to the point for my pur poses hereconsidering the intersection of disability with other axes of inequality 15 Such a project points us toward the necessity of an ethics based not on ability activity agency and empowerment but on a compassion that is rooted in our vulnerability and passivitythis nonpower at the heart of power as Derrida puts it In this light the ethical force of our relation to the disabled and to nonhuman others is precisely that it foregrounds the necessity of thinking ethics outside a model of reci procity between moral agents indeed as thinkers from Levinas and Lyotard to more recently Zygmunt Bauman have argued the ethical act might instead be construed as one that is freely extended without hope of reciprocation by the other As Bauman puts it the problem with an ethics based on reciprocity is that it implies calculability of action What more than anything else sets the contractually defined behavior apart from a moral one he continues is the fact that the duty to fulfill the duty is for each side dependent on the other sides record    It is so to speak in the power of my partner to set me by design or by default free to unbind me from my duties But those duties he lear ning from temple gr andin argues are heteronomic my relation to the Other is programmatically nonsymmetrical that is not dependent on the Others past present an ticipated or hopedfor reciprocation Hence all ethical models based on reciprocity and contractualism ignore the fact that we becomes a plu ral of I only at the cost of glossing over the Is multidimensionalitya multidimensionality that cannot be calculated that is a radically em bodied form of finitude not only of the disabled and of nonhuman sub jects but also of the normate subject itself now returned to itself as other with a new sense of its own nonnormative contingency35 I will end then on a very different note from what one typically finds in calls for animal rights and disability access one that returns us to the transvaluation of the trope of vision as an index of humanism with which the chapter began It looks forward as we will see to the next two chapters and will recall I hope my discussions in chapter 3 of J M Coetzees riveting fiction as read by Cora Diamond At the end of Memoirs of the Blind Derrida writes We all know about the episode in Turin    where Nietzsches com passion for a horse led him to take its head into his hands sobbing    Now if tears come to the eyes if they well up in them and if they can also veil sight perhaps they reveal in the very course of this experience    an essence of the eye    The eye would be destined not to see but to weep For at the very moment they veil sight tears would unveil what is proper to the eye And what they cause to surge up out of forgetful ness    would be nothing less than    the truth of the eyes whose ulti mate destination they would thereby reveal to have imploration rather than vision in sight to address prayer love joy or sadness rather than a look or a gaze    The blindness that opens the eye is not the one that darkens vision The revelatory or apocalyptic blindness the blindness that reveals the very truth of the eyes would be the gaze veiled by tears 12627 II Media Culture Practices This page intentionally left blank From Dead Meat to GlowintheDark Bunnies The Animal Question in Contemporary Art This chapter begins at the intersection of two questions one apparently quite complicated the other apparently quite simple The first questionexplored in some detail in the first half of the book concerns the ethical standing of at least some nonhuman animals It is a question with which we are confronted every day in the mass media indeed entire cable television networks are now built around the presumption of its possibility and it has increasingly captivated not just scientific fields like cognitive ethology ecology and cognitive science but also areas in the humanities such as philosophy psycho analysis theory and cultural studies generally For the purposes of this chapter I will assume that the ethical standing of at least some nonhuman animals is not just a live issue but one increasingly taken for granted even if how to formulate that ethical standing remains a complex question I allow myself this luxury in no small part because the two artists whose work I will be addressing take that standing for granted as they have affirmed in a variety of contexts The second question seems by comparison much more straight forward and perhaps almost trivial in comparison to the weight of the first but that is part of the reason I want to take it up here When con temporary artists take nonhuman animals as their subjectour treat ment of them how we relate to them and so onwhat difference does it make that those artists choose a particular representational strategy anda question I cant fully explore herea particular medium or art form such as painting sculpture installation or performance to name just a few To put this more directly there clearly has been in contemporary art an explosion of interest in what Derrida calls the question of the animal as theme and subject matter1 When address ing this topic however it is all too easy to fall into what Slavoj Žižek from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies with characteristic astringency has in another context called an un dialectical obsession with content2 What I am interested in on the other hand is how particular artistic strategies themselves depend on or resist a certain humanism that is quite independent of the manifest content of the artwork the fact that it may be about nonhuman ani mals in some obvious way In the contexts of the visual and visuality that I developed in the previous chapter and will continue to excavate in the chapter that fol lows we can bring the question I have in mind into even sharper focus along the following lines If as many of the most important contem porary thinkers have suggested certain representational strategies say the Renaissance theory of perspective or Benthams panoptical rendering of architectural space or the production of the gaze and spectatorship in film as critiqued by feminist film theory in the 1980s and so on can be indexed to certain normative modes of humanist subjectivity that they reproduce by the very nature of their strategies then we are well within our rights to askto put it succinctly for the momentwhat the relationship is between philosophical and artistic representationalism These are precisely the sorts of questions that practicing artists routinely engage in connection with the specific demands of particular representational media They bear very directly on not just the artis tic challenge but also the larger philosophical and ethical challenge of speaking for nonhuman animals speaking to our relations with them and how taking those relations seriously unavoidably raises the ques tion of who we are of the notion of the human that as we saw in chapter 3 the autobiographical animal to use Derridas phrase gives to itselfa question that may be answered quite indirectly not in the manifest content of the artwork or its message but in its formal strategies The Ethics of Disfiguration Sue Coes Dead Meat We find many faces in the paintings and drawings collected in Sue Coes book Dead Meat a collection of sketches paintings and drawings that Coe compiled over a sixyear period while traveling to slaughter houses and feedlots around North America3 Hundreds of faces even from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies thousands perhaps And we dont have to find them They find us As in Cow 13 or Pigs in a Circle they stare out at us on nearly every page by turns fearful afflicted or innocent What is remark able here though is that the faces belong mainly to the animals livestock so called In fact it is hard to find a human being with a face at all and when we do find them as in Electrocution or There Is No Escape they are usually misshapen or contorted How are we to understand this One way that suggests itself immediately is by means of the theo rization of the ethics of the face in contemporary philosophy and theorya debate that has conspicuously involved Emmanuel Levinas Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari among others Levinas theorizes the ethical call of the face as the site of an unanswer able obligation to which I am held hostage to use his term in an infinite responsibility to the other As Derrida has observed however though the subject is held hostage to the other by the first imperative of the intersubjective relationthou shalt not killin Levinas as in the JudeoChristian tradition generally this is not understood as a thou shalt not put to death the living in general For Levinas the subject is man whose ethical standing is secured by his access to both logos and the Word and so as Derrida puts it in Levinas the subject resides in a world where sacrifice is possible and where it is not forbidden to make an attempt on life in general but only on the life of man4 As we have seen earlier however for Derrida the animal has its point of view re garding me The point of view of the absolute other and nothing will have ever done more to make me think through this absolute alterity of the neighbor than these moments when I see myself naked under the gaze of a cat5 And from the vantage of Deleuze and Guattari Derridas critique of Levinas here might be viewed as leaving intact a certain humanist schema of the scopic and the visual which their critique of faciality in A Thousand Plateaus is calculated to dismantle in its insistence that the face is not a location still less a body part but rather a kind of grid or diagram that configures the space of inter subjective relations and desire itself making them available only at the expense of fixity and identity6 To put it schematically Deleuze and Guattari might well ask of Derrida how the moment of being looked at by his catnot just naked but seeing myself naked under the gaze from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies of a catcan be divorced from the face How can the lookingback of the animaland the ethical call harbored by that lookbe disengaged from the humanism for which the face and faciality generally is per haps the fundamental figure The art historian and critic Michael Fried gives a rather differ ent account of the face from the Levinasian one in his book Realism Writing Disfiguration On Thomas Eakins and Stephen Crane where he offers an analysis of figuration and representation that will help to shed light on the particularity of Sue Coes strategies and how we might assess their ethical force7 The key point of contact with the motifs we have sounded out thus far however briefly is readily voiced in the title of the essay on Crane that makes up the second half of Frieds book Stephen Cranes Upturned Faces where the intense visuality of Cranes prose is also indexed to the faceand to the blank page as its double or standinand its ethical call on us Pertinent here too is the fact that in Crane in Eakins and in Coe we will be dealing withimmersed in reallyscenes of violence and responsibility pri marily war as in Cranes The Red Badge of Courage the surgical theater of Eakins great painting The Gross Clinic and of course the killing floors of Coes Dead Meat What Fried finds in Crane is a mode of literary representation that involves a major emphasis on acts of seeing both literal and meta phorical8 But what is usually called Cranes impressionistic style should instead be understood Fried argues as a remarkable plumb ing of the relationship of a primitive ontological difference between the allegedly upright or erect space of reality and the horizontal space of writing which manifests itself in Crane as an implicit con trast between the respective spaces of reality and literary represen tation 99 This difference is related to the extraordinary and ex traordinarily haunting and even uncanny network of faces in Cranes fictionprimarily faces of the dead that stare back at us with unseeing eyesby virtue of the requirement that a human character ordinarily upright and so to speak forwardlooking be rendered horizontal and upwardfacing so as to match the horizontality and upwardfacingness of the blank page 99 On the one hand and here the connection to Coes animal faces is quite clear the faces of the deadlike the blank pagestare back at us and ask for our conferral of meaning through from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies representation on their abjection or suffering this is rendered in an especially powerful way in Cranes war fiction But at the same time as figures for the unnatural process of writing itselfwhen the upwardfacingness of the corpse hence of the page is considered not so much as a brute given but as a kind of artifactthey are products of that very process of representation itself 100 In trying to bring the readerviewer face to face with the world through writing however the writer only succeeds in defacing the world or to use Frieds term disfiguring it The dilemma in Crane is that the more he succeeds in this enterprise the more he in another sense fails This is so Fried argues because insofar as those deseman ticizing aspects of Cranes writing visuality sonority dialect and manipulation of perceptual scale just to name a few do their job they interpose themselves in their own materiality between the reader and the world that that realist project was supposedly intended to repre sent so that the world though he doesnt put it this way almost be comes a host if you will for an essentially vampiristic relationship to the writerly or representational project As Fried asks Wouldnt such a development threaten to abort the realization of the impres sionist project as classically conceived In fact would it not call into question the very basis of writing as communicationthe tendency of the written word partly to efface itself in favor of its meaning in the acts of writing and reading 11920 For Fried this uncanny or vampiristic quality of Cranes style is symptomatic of Cranes need to performatively confront the scene of writing through a mechanism of displacement and to do so in a manner that positively obscured the meaning of those representations from both writer and reader And this suggests he continues that the passages that describe the faces and recount responses to them are where Cranes unconscious fixation on the scene of writing not only comes closest to surfacing in a sustained and deliberate manner but also precisely owing to the manifestly dreadful nature of the faces and of the vicissitudes that befall them is most emphatically repressed In other words the thematization of writing as violent disfigurement and its association with effects of horror and repugnance but also of in tense fascination allowed the writer and a fortiori the reader to remain unconscious of the very possibility of such a thematization 12021 from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies Coes handling of what we could call after Fried the scene of represen tation or figuration whose index in both cases is a certain rendering and in Cranes case rendingof the face We remember Frieds obser vation that a human character ordinarily upright and so to speak forwardlooking be rendered horizontal and upwardfacing so as to match the horizontality and upwardfacingness of the blank page 99 In Coe however we find a double reversal of this dynamic First the violence that in Crane renders the human corpse horizontal and facing upward is in Dead Meat associated with a force that takes the naturally occurring horizontality of the animals portrayed living as they do on all fours and renders it strongly verticalnamely in the endless rows and rows of hoisted hanging animal corpses in the slaughterhouse and the packing plant that we find in images such as Horse Slaughterhouse or Poultry Plant Fire It is as if the animals cannot be allowed to assume the vertical upright posture reserved as even Freud tells us in Civilization and Its Discontents for the human without at the same stroke being defacedin many cases quite literally ie beheaded At the same timea strict corollary by this logicthe slaughter house workers remain mired in a strongly horizontal plane and not surprisingly their faces are often beastly or animalistic in the tra ditional speciesist sense of the word as in Electrocution or Scalding Vat and Scraping Machine The logic that systematically works its way through most of these pieces then is that the concrete individual ani mal body an individuality emphasized in pieces such as Cow 13 and Goat outside Slaughterhouse is through a process of corporately organized Taylorization mechanistically born bred killed and dis membered in a process through which it comes to have meaning for the carnophallogocentric socius to use Derridas wellknown term only by being reconstituted as meat or porka semantic transfor mation and mystification that is itself paralleled by the material mani festation of identical shrinkwrapped packages of brightly colored meat in the grocery store counter now thoroughly dissociated from the reality of its material production9 And this systematic violence against the animals is itself doubled by a less brutal though no less systematic violence that attends the workers who are forced by the na from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies ture of capitalism itself to do such worka point graphically captured in Coes rendering of the meatpacking workers in painting after paint ing and explicitly thematized in works such as CapitalLabor Second howeverand this is the point I would like to empha sizewhat we find here is not the excruciated relationship to rep resentation that Fried emphasizes in Crane and Eakins but rather its apparent displacement onto forces external to the work of representa tion itselfforces whose effects the artwork registers and then inten sifies The violence we find here is not artifactual associated with the inescapable violence and disfiguration of representation itself  but is instead associated with the external that is to say extrarepresenta tional forces of capitalism and factory farming We could say in other words that in contrast to Frieds Crane Coes painting aspires to the condition of writing but writing understood not as representation di vided against itselfnot as différance or iterability to borrow Derridas terms which are invoked by Fried10but as the direct communication Sue Coe Goat outside Slaughterhouse PA 1990 Copyright 1990 Sue Coe Courtesy of Galerie St Etienne New York from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies of a semantic and as it were external content of which the artwork is a faithful or perhaps dramatic enough representation to didactically incite ethical action and change on the part of the viewer Yet precisely here an interesting problem manifests itself While Coe is certainly within her rights to see the ethical function of her art at least in one sense as drawing our attention as powerfully as possible to the untold horrors of the slaughterhouse on another leveland it is this level that will be handled with considerable sophistication I think in Eduardo Kacs workthat ethical function and the representational ism it depends on rely on a certain disavowal of the violence what Fried calls the disfiguration of representation itself which immediately leads to an obvious question we might ask of Coe If the ethical function of art is what Coe thinks it is why not just show people photographs of stockyards slaughterhouses and the killing floor to achieve this end To put it another way what does art add And what does it mean that her art has to be more than real to be real Isnt the melodrama of visi bility to use Frieds phrase that we find in Dead Meat which is calcu lated to give the animal a face also in another sense an effacement of the very reality it aims to represent one that quite conspicuously manifests itself in the hyperbole disfiguration and melodrama of Coes work The paradoxical result for Coes work then is that it appeals to us to read it as directly indeed melodramatically legible of the con tent it represents but the only way it achieves that end is through its figural excess which is precisely not of the slaughterhouse but of the interposing materiality of representation itself We can unpack the implications of this point by remembering Frieds discussion of what might be called a drama some would even say a melodrama of visibility in Eakinss The Gross Clinic which may be brought into sharp contrast with the very different melodrama we find in Coes Dead Meat project11 My point here in calling Coes work melodramatic is not that it exaggerates what really goes on in a slaughterhouse but that in Coes work nothing is hidden from us On the contrary the paintings seem to form a kind of theater calculated to produce a surefire effect to use Frieds characterization of theatri cality by playing to the audience as the figures in the paintings human and animalrepeatedly look out at us imploringly fearfully or sadistically as if the entire affair inside the space of the painting is from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies staged only for us12 Unlike the experience of the viewer in what Fried calls the absorptive tradition in painting that culminates in modern ist abstraction the viewer in Coes work isnt denied as Fried puts it but rather addressed and held responsible even culpable for what is being shown inside the frame Hereto return to The Gross Clinictwo conspicuous features of Eakinss painting noted by Fried are very much to the point the rendering of the surgical patients body and the cringing figure of an older woman usually taken to be the patients mother As for the first Fried from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies of the attitude toward the viewer that that rendering impliesan es pecially intense version of the attitude typical of what Fried elsewhere famously calls the absorptive tradition in painting 59 Similarly the cringing figure dramatizes the pain of seeing in both the emphatic emptiness of her clawlike left hand the violent contortion of which is apprehended by the viewer as a threatat a minimum an offense to vision as such and the sightlessness that    she so feelingly em bodies 62 In these aggressions as Fried calls them these gestures of disfiguration Fried finds in the painting an implied affront to seeing a stunning or worse a wounding of seeingthat leads me to imagine that the definitive realist painting would be one that the viewer literally could not bear to look at 6465 Here we get a precise sense of the differences between the force of disfiguration at work in Eakinss representationalism and in Coes In Coe although there is disfiguration aplenty it is never a disfigura tion that resists vision or interpretationquite the contrary it invites a single univocal reading The violence of Eakinss affront to seeing that manifests itself in The Gross Clinic as incision deformation and even in a sense dismemberment a violence displaced and contained by being thematized as Fried from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies and the surgeonpainter carefully and dramatically deliberates its vio lent application 88 In this light we might well say of Coes Dead Meat that the knives and hooks of the slaughterhouse are never associ ated with the brush of the painter and the violence of representation asdisfiguration Thus if Eakinss putative realism in fact harbors a deeper more unsettling antirealism or perhaps better irrealism Coes melodramatic renderings themselves harbor a more fundamental and a more fundamentally comforting representationalism a signifying re gime whose best name might well be facialityeven if that faciality extends across species lines to include even to privilege as if somehow to redeem their suffering the nonhuman animals around which the paintings are built The opposite of this regimeor more precisely as Derrida would put it that which remains heterogeneous to it not its simple other might well be figured in the network of asignifying forms and their se rial iteration that wends its way throughout the works collected in Dead Meat14 Chief among these are the chains hooks tubes belts hoses ducts and the like that form in pieces such as Horse Slaughterhouse McWorld and Pecking Order a kind of ongoing cipher in the paint ings often extending beyond the borders of the pictorial space suggest ing their intrication in some larger insidious networka logic that is also extended to cover the representation of the masses of animal bod ies themselves in pieces such as Lo Cholesterol Buffalo or Feedlot From Coes representationalist point of view this network is di rectly associated with the force of capitalism Taylorization and the disassembly line they put in place In the sense I am emphasizing here however we might see it as figuring instead a kind of displacement or domestication of the Derridean sense of iterability that I discussed in the first half of the bookor as Fried would have it a kind of visible repression that traces and scores the otherwise representational logic of the paintings This logic even extends I would suggest to the ubiquitous numbered ear tags that mark the animals as fodder in the larger ma chine of agribusiness and factory farming with the sheer abstractness and pure seriality of the numerical system signifying nothing except this force Here the painting Goat outside Slaughterhouse is all the more striking in the contrast between the almost sculptural modeling of the animals head and the abstract numbers of the contrasting ear tag which from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies network of figures I have just noted in pieces like Ham Scrubber Given the conceptual coordinates of Coes Dead Meat project we can surmise that this force of abstraction coding and seriality would eventually find its most extreme logical extension in genetic engineer ing and beyond that in cloningan eventuality graphically depicted in Coes painting Future Genetics Inc Here again however we can interpret this in a second sense rather at odds with the artists own While Coes painting depicts the perverse extension of Taylorized fac tory farming to the production of misshapen and deformed animal Sue Coe Ham Scrubber 1988 Copyright 1988 Sue Coe Courtesy of Galerie St Etienne New York from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies mutants in a subterranean laboratory there is another sense in which we may view this logic as endemic to representation itself The clone may be the image of the perfect servant the obedient instrument of the master creators will as W J T Mitchell puts it but it also acti vates the deepest phobias about mimesis copying and the horror of the uncanny double15 Or to put this in Derridas terms the dream of pure Taylorized seriality is repetition without difference but the very meaning of iterability is that repetitionand representationcan take place only in and through the potentially mutating work of difference the specific material embodied pragmatic instance that threatens any dream of purity always shadowing pure seriality with the uncanny referenced by Mitchell And this opens up a second ethical register around the question of representation and its logicone quite differ ent from what Coe has in mindthat harbors real stakes for how we understand the humananimal relation As we saw in chapter 2 Derrida has argued that the constitu tive fantasy of humanism is that the human separates itself from the rest of the domain of the living by alone escaping subjection to the deconstructive force of iterability and the trace that in fact extends to all forms of representation and signification not just its paradigmatic case language And in this second ethical register the critique of spe ciesism emerges in fact from the critique of representationalism along the lines traced by Derrida in Eating Well where he suggests If one reinscribes language in a network of possibilities that do not merely encompass it but mark it irreducibly from the inside everything changes I am thinking in particular of the mark in general of the trace of iterability of différance These possibilities or necessities without which there would be no language are themselves not only human    And what I am proposing here should allow us to take into account sci entific knowledge about the complexity of animal languages genetic coding all forms of marking within which socalled human language as original as it might be does not allow us to cut once and for all where we would in general like to cut 11617 This may seem to be a very different kind of cut from the ones we witness in Dead Meat but in fact Derrida suggests the sacrificial sym bolic economy of carnophallogocentrism that subordinates woman to man and nonhuman animals to both is directly related toeven from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies motivateswhat we witness in Coes work The subject does not want just to master and possess nature actively Derrida writes In our cultures he accepts sacrifice and eats flesh    In our countries who would stand any chance of becoming a chef dEtat a head of State of thereby acceding to the head by publicly and therefore exemplar ily declaring him or herself to be a vegetarian 114 The More You Look the Less You See Eduardo Kac In October 2001 Eduardo Kac presented his project The Eighth Day in a gallery at Arizona State University on the heels of what is probably his most famous undertaking GFP Bunny 2000 Here again Kac uses transgenic lifeforms in this case mice zebra fish tobacco plants and a colony of amoebae instead of a rabbit modified by introducing into them an enhanced GFP gene green fluorescent protein derived from the jellyfish Aequorea Victoria that makes them glow green under certain lighting conditions As in that earlier work however GFP lifeforms are only part of the story16 In The Eighth Day viewers enter a dark space with a glowing bluelit Plexiglas semisphere at its center surrounded by the sounds of waves washing ashore Inside the terrarium are the lifeforms just mentioned as well as a specially designed biobot which contains as its cerebellum the GFP amoebae When the amoebae move toward one of the six legs of the biobot their movement is tracked by a com puter which makes that particular leg contract The biobot also serves as an avatar as Kac puts it of Web participants who can remotely control its eye with a panandtilt actuator so that the overall perceiv able behavior of the biobot is a combination of activity that takes place in the microscopic network of the amoebae and in the macroscopic human network Meanwhile viewers in the gallery can see the terrarium from both inside and outside the dome by means of access to a Web inter face installed in the gallery space which includes in addition to a biobot view a feed from a birdseyeview camera installed above the dome17 When we leave behind the technical and logistical aspects of the piece which are considerable to address the works intellectual ethical and social implications we enter another order of complexity Arlindo Machados comments in the collection of essays that accompa nied The Eighth Day are fairly representative of these discussions from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies Transgenic forms of life are often stigmatized for being produced in the laboratory in part because of the economic and possibly warlike interests that motivate their creation It is almost inevitable that non technical discussions involving biotechnologies take on a conservative bias recalling scenarios of apocalyptic science fiction or even dogmatic interdictions of religious order    The more experimental and much Eduardo Kac The Eighth Day 2001 detail Transgenic artwork with biological robot biobot GFP plants GFP amoebae GFP fish GFP mice audio video Internet httpsprockettelabarticeduekac from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies less conformist sphere of artwith its emphasis on creation by means of genetic engineering of works which are simply beautiful not utili tarian or potentially profit making along with the relocation of geneti cally modified products in cultural spaces such as museums and art galleries or in public spaces or even in homes    all this could help to elevate public discussion of genetics and transgenics to a more sophis ticated level18 This is essentially the thrust as well of Kacs own manifesto on trans genic art but the artist takes the additional step there of insisting that artists can contribute to increase global diversity by inventing new life forms and he imagines a day in the not too distant future when the artist literally becomes a genetic programmer who can create life forms by writing or altering a given genetic sequence19 This insistence complicates an already complicated situation considerably because it invites the sorts of trepidations rightly raised by critics such as Steve Baker who writes that Kac engages with the animal through techniques that strike many people as meddlesome invasive and profoundly unethical20 Its not that any of the animals used in his work are harmed they arent and Kac has repeatedly made it clear how seriously he takes his responsibility for the care and well being of the animals involved but rather that Kac seems to overlook the larger picture as Baker puts it namely that his work depends on and in a fundamental sense reproduces an entire set of institutions and practices of scientific research that subject millions of animals a year to distressing often painful and usually fatal experimentation a subjec tion of nonhuman beings of unprecedented proportions as Derrida puts it in which traditional forms of treatment of the animal have been turned upside down and replaced by an artificial infernal vir tually interminable survival in conditions that previous generations would have judged monstrous21 Such concerns are very important of course but I dont want to pursue them further herein part because they have received ample air time in the discussions of Kacs work but primarily because cer tain habitual oversimplifications endemic to addressing those concerns have tended to mask crucial aspects of Kacs work features that have a less obvious and thematic relation to how his projects ethically in tervene in our received views of the humananimal relationship and from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies beyond that in the question of posthumanism generally Something of the different direction I want to pursue is evoked by Kac early on in the transgenic art manifesto where he writes More than making visible the invisible art needs to raise our awareness of what firmly remains beyond our visual reach but nonetheless affects us directly Two of the most prominent technologies operating beyond vision are digital implants and genetic engineering22 In a recent essay on art and human genomics the critic Marek Wieczorek extends the point when he asks How do we picture a new age of genetic manipula tion    a literal synergy between computing and biology This is not just a question of representation in any straightforward sense because the digital code of the genome emblematic of a new mode of con sciousness is not a spatial blueprint of life not a twodimensional plan of what a heart or liver looks like but a long string of nucleotides written in endless permutations23 What this means in turn is that the problem of picturing this immense revolution may not simply be a matter of new forms of visuality but rather demand reconciling form with principle24 Hereand this is rather a different understanding from what we find in FriedWieczorek finds a precursor to this new work of Kacs that thinks the parallels between art and scientific theory in mini malism with its potentially endless sequence of repeated shapes Just as digitally encoded information has no intrinsic relationship to the form in which it is decodedit is not tied to a singular inher ently meaningful formso in minimalism repetition replaces sin gularity Moreover in minimalism art acknowledges the viewer whose physical interaction with the work produces evershifting view points over time through a kind of feedback loop which parallels a similar emphasis in systems theory as we have seen in chapter 1 on the autopoiesis Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela or the selfreference Niklas Luhmann of the observing systema fact we will find Kacs work insisting on again and again most obviously in his inclusion in the work itself of remote Internetbased observer participants Here however the point is not as Wieczorek puts it that reflexivity is regressive much like the obsessively pointless varia tions of LeWitts incomplete open cubes or Judds boxes25 Rather it is that reflexivity is recursive in the sense discussed in chapter 1 it uses its from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies own outputs as inputs as Luhmann defines it26 It is only on the basis of that recursivitya dynamic process that takes timethat reflexivity becomes productive and not an endlessly repeating proverbial hall of mirrors associated with the most clichéd aspects of postmodernity I will explore in greater detail in chapters 8 and 9 the dynamics of recursivity and how they are related to the questions of meaning and form for other kinds of art poetry architecture but for now I want to note that for our current purposes there are two points here one logi cal and one biological As for the first Wieczorek captures something of how Kacs work thematizes the central facta logical and cognitive factabout recursive selfreference as Luhmann has theorized it namely that observation precisely because it is contingent and selfreferential will always maintain the world as severed by distinctions frames and forms and this partiality precludes any possibility of representation of mimesis and any holistic theory Thus Luhmann writes the world is observable because it is unobservable27a point whose larger resonance and thematics I will explore in chapters 8 and 10 Of more immediate relevance for Kacs work however is the sec ond point the biological one that recursive selfreference is crucial to how different kinds of autopoietic beings establish their difference from everything else in the world which is to say their specific ways of being in the worlda being that is now thoroughly subordinated to an autopoietic becoming For Kacand here is where Wieczorek is right that it is not simply a matter of new forms of visualitythis calls for the kind of recalibration redistribution and displacement of the relation ship between meaning and the entire sensorium of living beings that I discussed in the previous chapter in which visuality itselfas the human sensory apparatus par excellenceis now thoroughly decen tered and subjected to a rather different kind of logic a point I return to in some detail in chapter 7 To put it another way Kac subverts the centrality of the human and of anthropocentric modes of knowing and experiencing the world by displacing the centrality of its metonymic standin human and humanist visuality He does this in several different ways some of which are comparatively straightforward such as Darker than Night 1999 and Rara Avis 1996 In the former the viewer is linked in a com municational loop to roughly three hundred fruit bats via a batbot from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies implanted in their cave which enables the viewer to hear the con verted echolocation sonar signals of the living bats while the viewer wears a VR headset that converts the batbots sonar emissions into an abstract visual display28 In Rara Avis viewers don a headset linked to a camera in the head of a large robotic bird in an enclosure surrounded by living birds which enables the viewer to look out from the robotic birds point of view In both works sounds Rara Avis and sonar sig nals Darker than Night originating from human participants are re introduced into the animals environment allowing them to experi ence the presence of an absent human other 16266 More interesting still is how Kacs work also exploits what we might call our lust for the visual and its humanist centrality by trad ing on it repeatedly the glowinthedark creatures the outré coloring of the bird in Rara Avis or even the playful visual pun on the human eyeball in Teleporting an Unknown State 1996 to name a few This is not just as one critic puts it a matter of the scopic reversal that is a re curring theme in Kacs work particularly the works on telepresence nor is it just about a dialogical interchange that serves to multiply Eduardo Kac Teleporting an Unknown State telepresence work 199496 httpsprockettelabarticeduekac from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies the points of view available as in The Eighth Day Nor is it exactly that to the extent that something livingparticularly a mammalglows green we have an index of alterity an interpretation resisted by Kac by the way29 In fact I would argue that the use of GFP in Kacs work particu larly with the rabbit Alba in GFP Bunny operates as a kind of feint or lure that trades on the very humanist centrality of vision that Kacs work ends up subverting and in this it has more than a little in com mon with Diller  Scofidios cagey relationship to spectacle in their Blur project as well see in chapter 8 On display here in other words are the humanist ways in which we produce and mark the other in cluding the animal other our carnophallogocentric visual appetite displayed here in the form of spectacle which is fed in this instance by GFP From this vantage the point is perhaps not so much as W J T Mitchell puts it in his widely read essay The Work of Art in the Age of Biocybernetic Reproduction that Kacs work dramatizes the dif ficulty biocybernetic art has in making its object or model visible be cause the object of mimesis here is really the invisibility of the genetic revolution its inaccessibility to representation30 Rather it is that Kacs workwith its glowinthedark creatures and its black lights drawn as much from the storehouse of cheesy mass culture as anywhere makes all of this all too visible by eliciting and manipulating familiar forms and conventions of contemporary visual appetite In doing so it may be understood against the backdrop of Mitchells larger point about the work of art in an age of biocybernetic reproduction that the curious twist of our moment is that the digital is declared to be triumphant at the very same moment that a frenzy of the image and spectacle is announced 315 It is a question then of what we might call the place of the visualbut eventually for that very reason of everything else too as we will see in the next chapter And this involves in Kacs work a cir cular and indeed recursive procedure where the artist uses or other wise appeals to specifically human visual habits and conventions for the purposes of making the point that the visual as we traditionally think of it can precisely no longer be indexed to those conventions and habits at all In this light one way to underscore the difference be tween productive recursivity in Kacs work and a mere hallofmirrors from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies reflexivity is to say that the whole point of the glowinthedark rabbit of GFP Bunny and how it seizes on certain spectacularizing modes of human visuality is that the harder you look the less you see Albas meaning if we want to put it that way is not to be found in the brute fact of the glow of her coat in fact one might well say the meaning of the work is everywhere but there31 From this vantage we might well think of the strategy Kac de ploys in the work Time Capsule 1997 as framed by this same logic In that piece Kac was televised and simultaneously webcast injecting into his leg a microchip with a unique identification number that reveals it self when scanneda device commonly used for registering and recov ering companion animals As part of the work Kac registered himself in an Identichip database as both animal and owner In addition the work included seven sepiatoned photographs of members of Kacs family from previous generations and a telerobotic Web scanning and xray display of the implant in Kacs leg Here again Kacs deployment of spectacle and the visual generally makes the point I think that the significance of the work is everywhere except in its elementsvehicles reallyof visuality and spectacle It begins to dawn on us just how true this is when we understand as Edward LucieSmith points out that Kac is of Jewish origin that a number of his family members some of them pictured in the photographs were Polish Jews who died in the Nazi Holocaust and how the microchip incorporating a number al ludes to the numbers tattooed on the arms of those who were herded into concentration campsbut here of course the identifying num bers cannot be read 22 Herded is indeed a word to be insisted on here as this piece also focuses our attention not on livestock animals but the domestic animalsmainly cats and dogsfor whom the chip is designed animals that a vast majority of owners describe as family members Are they less animals than those other living beings we call meat Than the Jews in the eyes of the Nazis who forced them into cattle cars at gunpoint Moreover this welter of complicated as sociations and category crossings can be amplified one last time when we remind ourselves of the questions addressed in chapter 3 around Derridas characterization of contemporary forms of animal exploita tion in biomedical research and factory farming as a holocaust a characterization shared by Coetzees Elizabeth Costello from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies All of this completely changes the understanding of theatrical ity as criticized by Fried The point is not just as Fried would have it that Kacs work is theater which in his terms it would surely be but that theater is not doing the work Fried thinks it does In Kac the artwork does indeed play up to the viewer but only as Derrida would put it to lead the viewer to the realization that the only place the meaning of the work may be found is no place not where the viewer irresistibly looks eg at the spectacle of the glowinthedark crea tures but rather as we saw in chapter 5 precisely where the viewer does not seenot refuses to look or even is prevented from see ing but rather cannot see If we keep in mind that theatricality de pends first and foremost on spatial distribution we can appreciate the resonance of Derridas comment invoked in my earlier discussions for Kacs attemptand the ethics of that attemptto situate the visual in ways that fundamentally trouble how we have typically indexed the human animal sensorium to the humananimal ontological divide that space isnt only the visible and moreover the invisiblean in visible that is itself not simply the opposite of vision32 In this light we can see more clearlyor perhaps I should say more obliquely how Kacs theatricalization of visuality doesnt evade the viewers fini tude and humanness as Fried would have it but rather underscores it in the specifically posthumanist sense that the field of meaning and experience is no longer thought to be exhausted by the selfreference of a particularly even acutely human visuality33 In the end then the contrast between Sue Coe and Eduardo Kac helps us to see in the realm of art the difference between two differ ent kinds of posthumanism that correspond to the distinction drawn at the end of chapter 4 a humanist posthumanism and a posthumanist one Coe may be viewed as a posthumanist in the obvious and thematic sense that she takes seriously the ethical and even political challenges of the existence of nonhuman animals this latter in her crossmapping of the exploitation of animals and of workers in factory farming within a Marxist frame But as I demonstrated in some detail in chapters 3 and 4 and Ill return to the question late in the next chapter you can well be committed to this posthumanist question in a humanist way that is to say in a way that reinstalls a familiar figure of the human at the center of the universe of experience in animal rights philosophy from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies or representation in Coes work And it is such a subject who then on the basis of that sovereignty extends ethical or artistic consideration outward toward the nonhuman other In this light Coes work is hu manist in a crucial sense indeed in the only sense that turns out to be fundamental to her work as art it relies on a subject from whom nothing in principle is hidden A subject who if blind is blind not consti tutively as I think Kacs work dramatizes in multiple ways but only because heand I would insist on the male pronoun in this instance for reasons that Derridas analysis of carnophallogocentrism makes clearhas not yet seen what Coes art is calculated to reveal so pow erfully indeed melodramatically This complicates considerablyone might even say fatefullyCoes conception of art as a form of wit nessing34 For what must be witnessed is not just what we can see but also what we cannot seeindeed that we cannot see That too must be witnessed But by whom if not by the other This page intentionally left blank When You Cant Believe Your Eyes or Voice Dancer in the Dark Given the critique of the humanist schema of visuality I have been developing over the past two chapters we are now in a better position to appreciate a cognate assertion with which I want to begin here sound is not voice The desire for it to be so seems to lie at the heart of much compelling art music and film How we feel about this desirethat to be human at all is to thoroughly take that desire for granted or conversely that to live in postEnlightenment much less posthumanist culture is to see that desire as romantic in the worst possible senseis a question visited on audiences with uncanny and disconcerting force in Lars von Triers film Dancer in the Dark When the film was first released in May 2000 it provoked violently divergent responses from its audiences even as it won the Palme dOr at the Cannes Film Festival the audience as one reviewer reported erupted with an indecipherable storm of cheers and catcalls1 Some viewers walked out of the theater visibly shaken and in tears while others just walked outhalfway through the film This nearly unprecedented po larization carried through to the reviews which ranged from the awe struck to the dismissive and merely nasty Some praised the film lav ishly Youve never seen anything like Dancer in the Dark one wrote another called it a work of thrilling originality2 At the other end of the spectrum a reviewer for the Nation complained that the film was about seeing how much of the preposterous he von Trier can get you to swallow without gagging more pointedly still another labeled it a genuinely infantile work an ugly selfindulgent folly3 Even reviewers who supported the film felt the need to disavow it while admitting that the power of Dancer in the Dark is undeniable David Ansen in Newsweek called it a magnificent sham riddled with emo tional sadism4 What is going here when you cant believ e your eyes or voice To begin to answer that question we need to get a fix on how to approach this weird and iconoclastic film what sorts of generic expectations we may bring to it That however is only the point of entry into the much more complicated question I will take up later the question of what we might call the films ethical project and how it might well be the source of its audiences and reviewers hysterical reactions a term whose appropriateness will become clear I hope in due course To take up the question of genre first we have to under stand that for Dancer in the Dark any hint of reality character in the usual sense verisimilitude and the like are for the purposes at hand the merestand I do mean the merestvehicles for the films deeper concerns Here it will suffice to simply register the shameless melodrama of the plot the incredibly innocent Selma played by the pop phenom Björk in what nearly everyone agrees is a stunning per formance who is slowly going blind sacrifices her own life so that her tenyearold son Gene Vladica Kostic may receive an operation that will save his sight from the ravages of the same congenital disease Dancer in the Dark in other words is no more satisfactory fulfilling or compelling in terms of plausibility and Aristotelian necessity than say The Marriage of Figaroand that is precisely the point In fact the films power is in a profound sense inseparable from what many view ers will see as its absurdity if one wants to put it that way precisely in the way that the absurdity of opera its melodrama its hyperbole its staginessall those qualities that make people either love or hate opera too is in fact absolutely central to operas philosophical and ethical project To put it as bluntly as possible Dancer in the Dark like opera isnt about reality it is about what reality turns away from and the aversion to borrow an Emersonian term I will excavate later on of opera to that turning away In that it is again like opera more real than realitybut more about that in a moment On the question of genre it needs to be said that although Dancer in the Dark invites us to make it legible within the genre of the Hollywood musical this is ultimately a blind alley The film is not a musical at least not in that sense While the musical insists on as a constitutive feature the seamless continuity of the world inside and outside the musical numbers themselvescharacters engaged in real istic dialogue among passersby who realistically pay no attention to when you cant believ e your eyes or voice them suddenly break into song and the passersby suddenly join in Dancer takes great pains to insist on the radical split between the world of Selmas fantasy in which the musical sequences take place and the world that the film itself in broader terms constructs and inhabits Still the film certainly does situate itself in relation to the Hollywood musical its conventions and what they signify And in this light Dancer might be viewed as an intensification of the stakes of the Hollywood musi cal taking it more seriously than the musical itself ever did which may be in part what so irritates those who despise this film and at the same time as a deconstruction of the musicals way of imagining those stakesa posture that the film achieves by insisting on the clear distinction between the world of the main character Selma and its own In these terms Dancer in the Dark would force the question as it were Would Gene Kelly be willing to die to dance with his umbrella in Singin in the Rain Fred Astaire put a gun to his head for the sake of dancing with his mop It is as if the problem were not that the musical as a genre is so preposterous that no one can sit still for it anymore but that it isnt preposterous enoughwhich is to say that it no longer pur sues with enough seriousness and extremity enough abandonment its own claims and project To do soto be that preposterous and that serious at the same timeis to move by way of thumbnail definition from the realm of the musical to the realm of opera and to realize that on the most basic level those claims have to do as Stanley Cavell has suggested with life and death and with sound and vision as modalities for experiencing the world and the loss of the worldall of which are related to the question of film as a medium and how this film relates to the limits of that medium From this vantage we would do better to think of Dancer in the Dark as a kind of postmodern opera rather than a musical Here Cavells work on these questionsspanning by now several books from the early study The World Viewed Reflections on the Ontology of Film through two books on Hollywood genre films to the collections Themes Out of School and the more recent A Pitch of Philosophycan be of some help For Cavell the philosophical and ethical significances of film and of voice in opera are structured by the larger problematic that occupies the whole of his work namely the problem of philosophi cal skepticism I have already touched on the point in chapter 3 and when you cant believ e your eyes or voice I will revisit it in much more detail on the terrain of Cavells reading of Emerson in chapter 9 After Descartes and Kant skepticism names not just an epistemological problem but a more profound and deeply ethical loss of the world that is coterminous with Enlightenment modernity itself in which the modern condition is to be homeless in the world permanently doomed to haunt it rather than inhabit it as Cavell sometimes puts it For Cavell the significance of film and of operatic voice is located at what he calls the crossing of the lines of skepticism and romanticismthat is to say the juncture at which our desire for contact with the world of things and of others our need to believe that what we know experience and love is of the world is crossed by our knowledge that we are profoundly and permanently isolated locked as Emerson puts it in a prison of glass The most famous version of the settlement with skepticism Cavell argues is probably Kants in The Critique of Pure Reason which argues 1 Experience is constituted by appearances 2 Appearances are of something else which accordingly cannot itself appear 3 All and only functions of experience can be known these are our categories of the understanding 4 It follows that the something elsethat of which appearances are appearances whose existence we must grantcannot be known the famous Ding an sich or thing in itself In discovering this limitation of reason reason proves its power to itself over itself 5 Moreover since it is unavoidable for our reason to be drawn to think about this unknowable ground of appearance reason reveals itself to itself in this necessity also5 The dissatisfaction with Kants settlement with skepticism is readily imaginable of course but what is less clearand even more important to Cavellis the companion satisfaction that is expressed in Kants portrait of the human being as living in two worlds in one of them determined in the other free    One romantic use for this idea of two worlds lies in its accounting for the human beings dissatisfaction with as it were itself    as if the one stance produced the wish for the other as if the best proof of human existence were its power to yearn as if for its better or other existence Another romantic use for this idea of our two worlds is its    insight that the human being now lives in neither world that we are as is said between worldsa condition Cavell characterizes as the endemic worldlessness or homelessness when you cant believ e your eyes or voice that is of a piece with the modern condition6 Philosophical skepticism after the Kantian turn in other words names for Cavell a radical form of posthumanism one that Kants transcendental turn cf items 4 and 5 in the list just cited attempts to recontain and romanticismas well see in different permutations in the next three chaptersnames the persistence of the humanist desire for holism unity and coher ence in the face of that knowledge All of which makes postskeptical posthumanist philosophyin a phrase that has obvious resonance not only for the character of Selma in Dancer in the Dark but also for the adjacent autism of Temple Grandina philosophy of immigrancy of the human as a stranger7 In this light Selmas encroaching blindness in the film might be read as a figure for the inevitability of the general human condition of being in the dark wandering in a world of shad ows and specters never at home but merely sometimes at rest Along the same lines the philosophical import of voice in opera then is that it communicates that we may leap as it were from a judgment of the world as unreal or alien to an encompassing sense of another realm flush with this one into which there is no good reason we do not or cannot step unless opera works out the reasons Such a view Cavell continues will take singing I guess above all the aria to express the sense of being pressed or stretched between worldsone in which to be seen the roughly familiar world of the philosophers and one from which to be heard a world to which one releases or abandons ones spirit a world that recedes when the breath of the song ends 144 The resonance of this formulation for the character of Selma is clear enough and it is only sharpened by Cavells sugges tion that Kants vision of the human being as living in two worlds corresponds roughly to two general matching interpretations of the expressive capacity of song ecstasy over the absolute success of its expressiveness in recalling the world as if bringing it back to life melancholia over its inability to sustain the world which may be put as an expression of the absolute inexpressiveness of the voice of its failure to make itself heard to become intelligible 141 This last abandoning ones spirit to and giving voice to a world that no one will hearis evidently a mad state Cavell adds and it is one that seems to be reserved for the women of opera 140 and in the case at hand of course reserved for Selma Cavell is here responding to Catherine when you cant believ e your eyes or voice Cléments assertion in Opera or The Undoing of Women that opera is about the death of womenthat is to say it is about the countless forms in which men want and want not to hear the womans voice    to know and not know what she knows about mens desires8a claim that Cavell will modulate into the rather different and shall we say more strictly philosophical assertion that a womans singing exposes her as thinking so exposes her to the power of those who do not want her to think 146 in which case she becomes for Cavell a figure for that philosophical selftorment whose shape is skepticism in which the philosopher wants and wants not to exempt himself from the closet of privacy wants and want not to become intelligible expressive ex posed 132 The stakes of this revisionist relationship to Cléments thesis are perhaps apparent enough for a film that ends with Selmas death by hanging Does she die because she is a woman Because she thinks Because she sings from a world that imagines the two might coincide But the stakes of that revision are complicated by Cavells surprising suggestion that the mad state reserved for women in opera usually takes place only after their words can treat some difficulty internal to their marrying as if skepticism is narratively figured as an assault on marriage 14041 What we find in the womans operatic voice is exposure to a world of the separation of the self from itself in which the splitting of the self into speech is expressed as the separation from someone who represents to that self the continuance of the world    in whom ones expectation of intelligibility has been placed and col lapses 151 Moreover this thematization is redoubled in Hollywood film in the theme of remarriage Cavell has written a whole book about it Pursuits of Happiness The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage which suggests that the validity of the bond of marriage is assured    by something I call the willingness for remarriage as a way of continu ing to affirm the happiness of ones initial leap As if the chance of happinessthe chance of continuing to sing and dance to hope in the face of skepticismexists only when it seconds itself9 What is pertinent about this aspect of Cavells thesis is that in Dancer in the Dark what cannot be missed is the matter of Selmas conspicuously absent husband and her equally conspicuous rebuffing of her suitor Jeff played by Peter Stormare And while she permits when you cant believ e your eyes or voice a certain amount of conversational intimacy with her neighbor and landlord Bill David Morse they talk late into the night about going to musicals when they were kids and so on we are to understand that this is possible only because Bill is marriedas if in Cavells terms Selmas ability to continue to believe in the world that is rapidly reced ing from sight resides not in the possibility of her remarriage hence her repeated rejections of Jeffs overtures in the films most important musical number Ive Seen It All but in her handing down the gift of continued sight to her son The only way of ensuring the contin ued existence of the world is not marriage and what it signifies but the rejection of marriage in an act of sacrifice that might be characterized as radically feminine in its rejection of a nuclear heteronormativity that at the least lurks in the background of Cavells speculations on remarriage The relationship of the two worlds of vision associated with epistemology and sense certainty on the one hand and of voice asso ciated with the loss of the world under skepticism and the hope of its recovery on the other is complicated even more by Cavells contention that the ethical and philosophical project of opera was at a certain point taken over by filma contention he bases on analogizing the cameras powers of transfiguration to those of music each providing settings of words and persons that unpredictably take them into a new medium with laws of its own10 Just what those settings are may be clarified by Cavells adaptation of Heideggers famous thesis on the broken tool Film for Cavell is a phenomenon in which a particular mode of sight or awareness is brought into play by a disruption of what Heidegger calls the workworld a disruption of the matters of course running among our tools and the occupations they extend It is upon the dis ruption of such matters of course of a tool say by its breaking that we find to use Heideggers phrase the worldhood of the world an nouncing itself in all its conspicuousness and obstinacy its thereness11 We have here to do he continues with something about the human capacity for sightand here the link with the problem of skepticism becomes clearor for sensuous awareness generally something we might express as our condemnation to project to inhabit a world that goes essentially beyond the delivery of our senses In this light one may read Buster Keaton in The General for instance to exemplify an when you cant believ e your eyes or voice acceptance of the enormity of this realization of human limitation de nying neither the abyss that at any time may open before our plans nor the possibility despite that open possibility of living honorably 175 Or more to the point for our purposes the same might be said of Fred Astaires dancing which far from being escapist as is usu ally charged with the Hollywood musical is meant as a removal not from life but from death as facing the music as a response to the life of inexorable consequences 23a reading that would seem to apply quite poignantly to Selmas musical fantasies in the face of blindness and eventually of death itself Keatons comedy Astaires dancing and Selmas musicals then all face the music of skepticism in the same way that the aria does in opera but the difference is that film democratizes the knowledge hence at once blesses and curses us with it by telling us that it is as available to all as the ability is to hold a camera on a subject so that a failure so to perceive to persist in missing the subject is ascribable only to ourselves Thus the philosophical and ethical problem of inhabiting a world that goes essentially beyond the delivery of our senses is only intensified in film by virtue of its very medium Our sense of films specific relation to this problem can be sharpened if we attend to Cavells distinction between painting and photography and film for him as a mode of photography After the advent of photog raphy what painting wanted he suggests was a sense of presentness not exactly a conviction of the worlds presence to us but of our pres ence to it At some point the unhinging of our consciousness from the world as in the fall into skepticism after Kant interposed our subjectivity between us and our presentness to the world Then our subjectivity became what is present to us individuality became isola tion The route to conviction in reality was through the acknowledg ment of that endless presence of self12 In a passage worth comparing with my discussion in chapter 3 of the spectrality of visual media as Derrida describes it Cavell asserts that photography on the other hand and with it film overcame subjectivity in a way undreamed of by painting a way that could not satisfy painting one which does not so much deflect the act of painting as escape it altogether by automatism by removing the human agent from the task of reproduction    To maintain conviction in our connection with reality to maintain our when you cant believ e your eyes or voice presentness painting accepts the recession of the world Photography maintains the presentness of the world by accepting our absence from it The reality in a photograph is present to me while I am not present to it13 We are to use Derridas words spectralized by the shot So it is that film for Cavell has a kind of magical ability to meet the threat of skepticism not by literally presenting us with the world but by permitting us to view it unseen as though the worlds projec tion explains our forms of unknownness and of our inability to know 40 There is an important reversal here in fact two reversals If music and voice as we find them in opera met the loss of the world under skepticism by an assertion that we nevertheless miraculously existin this sense music and song come to the rescue of language after skep ticism as Cavell sometimes puts itthey did so only at the price of acknowledging that the world of things was always already lost Gone In photography and film on the other hand the existence of the world is miraculously affirmed via automatism but the price we pay for the worlds recovery is that it no longer exists for us It is radically ahuman other We cant know or touch the world precisely because it manifests itself unbidden without our help Film is thus what the world looks like when were not there What is most interesting hereespecially for the purpose of dis cussing a film such as Dancer in the Dark in which the relationship be tween the visual the auditory and the vocal is so pressingis Cavells insistence that while we dont know how to think of the connection between a photograph and what it is a photograph of The image is not a likeness he rightly insists one might wonder that similar questions do not arise about recordings of sound14 Is the difference between auditory and visual transcription he asks a function of the fact that we are fully accustomed to hearing things that are invisible not present to us not present with us We would be in trouble if we werent so accustomed because it is the nature of hearing that what is heard comes from someplace whereas what you can see you can look at    We are not accustomed to seeing things that are invisible or not present to us not present with us    Yet this seems ontologically to be what is happening when we look at a photograph 18 The idea here is that with the visual the lines of determination run from the intentional subject to the object to what we look at and hence the when you cant believ e your eyes or voice world manifest is suddenly removed from the equation With sound on the other hand the lines run from the object where sound comes from to the subjectit is as Derrida might put it a spatialization of the subjectobject relationso that a corollary magic would involve our insertion into the equation as if we had to actively listen just as we actively direct sight to hear anything at all What I want to suggest is that something like this reversal is ex actly what happens in Dancer in the Dark with profound implications for how the film stages the relationship between the auditory and the visual and within that the relationship of both of these to the project of film as a medium There are two dynamics at work here and it is cru cial to disarticulate them on the one hand Selmas drama and its philo sophical and ethical significance and on the other what the film from a quite different vantage does with that drama It is here on the strength of this disarticulation that we can begin to sense some of the limits of Cavells workthe extent to which it is we might say Selmacentric Let us return briefly to Cavells account of visual versus auditory tran scription in The World Viewed specifically his contention when I am in the presence of an English horn playing I still dont literally hear the horn I hear the sound of the horn So I dont worry about hearing a horn when the horn is not present because what I hear is exactly the same    whether the thing is present or not What this rigmarole calls attention to is that sounds can be perfectly copied and that we have various interests in copying them 368 It is as if recorded sound has taken the place of Roland Barthess photograph and its umbilical cord to the real critiqued by Derrida in chapter 3 In this light Cavells dis cussion of visual versus auditory transcription would appear to take its place as part of that film theory that has assured us as Kaja Silverman puts it that there is no difference between recorded and prerecorded soundsthat the apparatus is miraculously capable of capturing and retransmitting the profilmic event in all its auditory plenitude so that with each new testimonial to the authenticity of recorded sound cin ema seems once again capable of restoring all phenomenal losses15 As Silverman points out however it is relatively easy to demonstrate that every acoustic event is inseparable from the space in which it occurs and that in sound recording as in image recording the technological when you cant believ e your eyes or voice apparatus in question is always highly selective isolating and intensify ing some features and ignoring others Indeed as Douglas Kahn has exhaustively shown in his study Noise Water Meat A History of Sound in the Arts the kinds of qualifications and nuances voiced by Silverman are precisely those that have captivated the huge body of work in sound art in the twentieth century much of which foregrounds the techno logical mediation and environmental embeddedness of sound as a me dium think for instance of John Cage or Alvin Lucier to name only two wellknown examples16 From this vantage Cavells remarks on auditory versus visual transcription seem to reintroduce the very kind of phenomenological plenitude that film automatically delivers in Cavells account but without the attendant and crucial clarification that such plenitude is the product of fantasy only To linger over this moment in Cavells work is to realize that there is a crucial and altogether symptomatic aporiain fact a double aporiaat the heart of his understanding of voice in relation to sound As for the first remember that for Cavell sound and voice are in the deepest sense not continuous but opposed voice aligned with the sub ject it takes over the function of the Word after language has been subjected to the withering force of skepticism and sound with the object as that which comes from the world to the subject as it were unbidden But it is difficult to see how the difference between sound and voice can be maintained as a constitutive ontological difference how the interiority of voice as expression can be quarantined from the exteriority that is its material medium and condition of possibility in sound To put it as concisely as possible voice and sound exist along a continuum not a divide which is simply to say in another register that one persons voice is another persons noisea point hardly laid to rest by appeals to the generic norms of opera or any other art form More important than this however is the second aporia interior to voice itself As Cavell explains it film reverses the ascension in the ater of character over actor in theater the emphasis is that this char acter could will accept other actors which thus figures the fated ness in human existence the selfs finality or typicality In film the actor not the role is predominant and this is a vehicle for films demo cratic emphasis on the potentiality in human existence the selfs journeying In opera however the relation of actorsinger and role when you cant believ e your eyes or voice is unimportant beside the fact of the new conception it introduces of the relation of voice and body in which this voice is located inone might say disembodied withinthis figure this double this person this persona this singer whose voice is essentially unaffected by the role17 What makes Cavells account here fascinating is its radical am bivalence about the voice as disembodied withinbut within what Here the Cavellian voice would seem legible as a variety of what Slavoj Žižek calls the Cartesian subject in all its abstraction the empty punc tuality we reach after subtracting all its particular contents what we might call the principle of voice is thus disembodied within a sub ject whose contingent features are unimportant a subject that is in Cavells words this figure this double this person this personain short this etcetera18 What this suggests I think is that voice in Cavell is a figure for presence but a presence that as in Descartes and Kant should not be confused with substance and is in fact based on the tran scendence of substance as pathological contingency and materiality to use Kants term More precisely then the apparent opposition of sound and voice in Cavellthe first aporia I touched onis subtended by a more fundamental commitment to a presence that links them presence of the world to itself captured in the automatism of the pho tograph and sound recording and presence of the voice to itself that testifies to the worlds loss or passing under skepticismthat knows it and in voicing that knowledge sings humanisms last aria It is here that the Lacanian schema of the subject I have already invoked by way of Žižek and Silverman with its interweaving of the two sides of voice and sound Symbolic and Real and so on may be of help Silverman for example in her pathbreaking study The Acoustic Mirror insists following Lacan that meaning and materiality subject and object are always coimplicated and interwoven in a symbolic and psychic economy of imbalance constituted by a lack at the center of the subject who can be subject only insofar as he has acceded to the dic tates of a Symbolic order not his own in what she characterizes as a preOedipal castration of a subject who is structured by lack long before the discovery of sexual difference a subject whose very coher ence and certitude are predicated on division and alienation19 This diacritical interweaving rather than Cavellian opposition of presence and absence has for her particular and direct implications for reading when you cant believ e your eyes or voice the engendering and embodying of voice in film Classical cinema Silverman writes requires the female voice to assume similar respon sibilities to those it confers upon the female body where it operates as a fetish filling in for and covering over what is unspeakable within male subjectivity In her vocal as in her corporeal capacity womanas fetish may be asked to represent that phenomenal plenitude which is lost to the male subject with his entry into language though she is more frequently obliged to display than to conceal lackto protect the male subject from knowledge of his own castration by absorbing his losses as well as those that structure female subjectivity 3839 Here we cant help but recall Cavells contention that opera is about the countless forms in which men want and want not to hear the womans voice    to know and not know what she knows about mens desires20 But it is crucial to remember that in Cavells account the idea that womens singing exposes them to death is rewritten specifically in terms as exposes her as thinking so exposes her to the power of those who do not want her to think 146in which case she becomes for Cavell a figure for that philosophical selftorment whose shape is skepticism in which the philosopher wants and wants not to exempt himself from the closet of privacy wants and want not to become intelligible expressive exposed 132 In making this turn however Cavell would seem to take away with one hand what he has given with the other and that is the specificity and materiality of womans embodiment in relation to voicean embodiment that a posthumanist reading would surely insist on A similar double gesture is at work in Cavells use of Freuds distinction between orality and vo cality in Freuds essay Negation to account for the at once primi tive or bodily and sophisticated or performative power of the voice Cavell wants to capture the interlacing of the spectacular vocality of opera in its aspect as orality and in its aspect as exposure or display sometimes named seductiveness 145 For Cavell the power of voice in opera as a judgment of the world on the basis of called forth by pain beyond a concept is itself rooted in the oral primi tive basis of judgment as explained in Freuds theory in Negation where introjection and expulsion from the body are the origins of af firmative or negative judgments As a result for Cavell the very draw ing and expelling of the breath in singing enacts a kind of urdialectic when you cant believ e your eyes or voice between bringing the world nearer overcoming skepticism and then pushing it away in a transcendence that is also a mourning 148 Here one would simply want to point out by way of Lacan and his inheritors such as Silverman and Žižek that the drives including orality are always already denaturalized because they are accessible only retroactively by means of the Symbolic itself From this vantage the fundamental issue with the voices power is not whether it can be tethered via the body orality to the world of the Cavellian ordi nary and everyday thereby ensuring us that the pain of the operatic voice remains real and not as it were merely epistemological Rather the body itself is already denaturalized and derailed to use Žižeks term by the Symbolic order so that the primitive basis of voice the drive rather than coming first as in Cavell is instead a retroactively determined and excessive product of the Symbolic of desire in a psychic economy characterized above all by imbalance It thus never was in our power you might say to lose the world in the way Cavell imagines or to lose that loss by means of the voice and its introjection or expulsion All of which is to say that the suggestive correspondence between the Lacanian theory of the split subject of desire and Cavells reading of singing as disembodied within the doubleness of the human and the splitting of the self into speech is and will remain only thatsuggestive21 Meanwhileto clarify the stakes of some of this for the film itselfit is obvious enough that Selma is doubly marked by figures of castration indeed by the most canonical such figures there are in her encroaching blindness and in her death by hanging But the question turning now from Cavells terms to those of psychoanalysisis the na ture of this castration what it is supposed to signify Is this as Silverman might suggest about killing off the feminine and maternal body in the service of phallic disavowal of preOedipal castration in which Selma is sacrificed for those losses she is made to bear Or is something else going on here In fact what is most important about Selmas castration is not that it robs her of agency butquite the reversethat it makes her the films maximum example of agency Moreover the force of her agency would seem to increase in direct proportion to her growing loss of vision the increasingly melodramatic absurdity of her situa tion and how she responds to its mounting crisis This is made clear in when you cant believ e your eyes or voice any number of ways not least in her steadfast refusal of the otherwise advantageous romantic overtures by Jeff her assertion in the films most powerful musical number that Ive seen all I need to see even as he suggests that if she marries him and then sees Niagara falls has grandchildren and so on the world will be in Cavellian terms re stored to her in and through marriage Crucial here too is the motif of Selmas absent husbanda point to which I will return in a moment We can clarify the status of castration in relation to the feminine and the Symbolic in the film most readily by recourse to Silvermans fascinating discussion of how in Hollywood castration is not the only trope through which dominant cinema conflates the female voice with the female body 63 Here she takes issue quite pointedly with Michel Chions formulation in La voix au cinéma that in much the same way that the feminine sex is the ultimate point in the deshabille the point after which it is no longer possible to deny the absence of the penis there is an ultimate point in the embodiment of the voice and that is the mouth from which the voice issues22 In Silvermans estimation Chion here simply reproduces on theoretical terrain Hollywoods con flation of the female voice with the female body and so organizes female sexuality around the image of    the insatiable organ hole that may be figured as either mouth or vagina 63 With this turn the interiority which Hollywood imputes to her has nothing whatever to do with transcendence or Cartesian cogitation On the contrary that interiority helps to establish the female body as the absolute limit of female subjectivity    Womans psyche is only a further extension of her bodyits other side or to be more precise its inside 64 What this means for Silverman however is that the yawning chasm of a corporeal interiority that is posited as a major port of entry into her subjectivity is better viewed as the site at which that subjectivity is introduced into her with the voice the preferred point of insertion 67 In short the female voice and with it the mouth from which it is sues are the point of entry for the phallus the Law and the Symbolic into female subjectivity if classical cinema has its way Here however valuable as it is for exposing some of the prob lems with Cavells work on voice opera and film we glimpse some thing like the limit of Silvermans thesis for understanding Dancer in the Darkor perhaps we should say that we begin to understand how when you cant believ e your eyes or voice Silverman What is most unmistakable in Selmas drama of course and it is crucial to the posthumanist ethical project of the film and how that project is linked to its embodimentis the unmasking of the Law as a senseless contingent machine constructed utterly by factitious selfinstantiation The film makes this clear in any number of ways from the adjacent drama of Bill her landlord policeman who betrays Selma and steals her money to pay off bills run up by his freespending wife to the almost sadomasochistic courtroom drama and the facile construction of Selma as a murderer to the fact that justice and death by hanging for Selma are determined in the end not by justice but by money In light of all of this we might give a rather different interpretation than Silvermans to the altogether unavoidable matter of Björks performative relationship to the mouth and tongue as site of the female voice at key moments in the musical numbers her tongue swells into a kind of fleshy protuberance a wall blocking entry into the interiority of the female subject as the voice soars and asserts its power Here the performative use of the mouth and tongue uncannily expresses not the entry of the Symbolic and the phallic Law into the feminine subject via the organ hole of the mouth and voicenot the site at which that subjectivity is introduced into herbut rather I would argue its rejection and blockage which coincides with the raising of the womans voice itself to its highest registers23 I would like to take this striking performative punctuation of the film by Björk as an index of the fact that there is another more profound sense of the feminine at work in Dancer in the Darka sense that perhaps accounts for the wild ambivalence and hysteria that greeted the film upon its release Here Žižeks work on sacrifice suicide and the act as feminine will help us understand that there are two differ ent aspects of the feminine at work in the film The point of agree ment between Silverman and Žižek versus Cavells reading would no doubt be their insistence via Lacan that any relationship to the world of the object the Thing the body the drives and so on is always riven with difference and denaturalized that is to say the human is thus that fantasmatic object the auto that the autobiographical animal gives to itself to use Derridas phrasing that constitutes itself by repressing this more fundamental posthumanist symbolic economy when you cant believ e your eyes or voice They would disagree however on the ethical ramifications of this fact visàvis the question of the feminine Where Silverman would find in the phallic regime of Hollywood film the displacement of preOedipal losses onto the feminine body and voice Žižek would identify the phallic itself with such losses and would therefore locate the femi nine at the very core and as the very truth of the phallic This is so in Žižeks reading because the phallus in Lacan as the origin of desire is not natural not given as such but is instead a signifierwhich is to say that desire and the phallus that constitutes it are socially pro duced and culturally determined so that the Real of the socalled drives the biological the body and of course the feminine body in contrast to male cogito becomes accessible only by being retroactively posited as original and natural by the contingent and diacritical sys tem of the Symbolic itself As Žižek puts it the phallusassignifier thus operatesagainst the clichéd notion of the phallus as the siege of male natural penetrativeaggressive potencypoweras a kind of prosthetic artificial supplement it designates the point at which the big Other the Symbolic a decentered agency supplements the subjects failure its lack of coordination and unity24 The phallus that is to say rather than being the very mark and icon of humanism and its law is properly understood always already posthumanist and in that sense feminine Žižek explores this theme in any number of registers including romanticisms commonplace of madness as the positive foundation Björk in Dancer in the Dark 2000 directed by Lars von Trier when you cant believ e your eyes or voice of normality which clearly announces the Freudian thesis that the pathological provides the key to the normal Given my discussion in chapter 5 most interesting for our purposes perhaps is his example of the Enlightenment idea that blindness itself provides the key to under standing the logic of vision in the same way that in Malebranche the pathological case of feeling a hand one does not have in fact provides the key to explaining how a normal person feels the hand he actually possesses In strict analogy to Lacans claim that a madman is not only a beggar who thinks he is a king but also a king who thinks he is a kingbecause he directly grounds his symbolic mandate in his immediate natural propertiesMalebranche claims that a madman is not only he who feels his missing hand without having one but also he who feels the hand he really has since when I claim to feel my hand directly I confound two ontologically different registers the material bodily hand and the representation of a hand in my mind which is the only thing I am actually aware of25 And this in turn is analogous to the status of the phallus itself as prosthetic since it too is referenced to the natural body and yet can only be experienced through mediation by the regime of the signifier and the Symbolic There is an important point of contact here as we know from earlier chapters between Žižeks account of the Lacanian phallus and the set of terms that cluster in Derridas work around the prosthesis the supplement and so ona point to which I will return in a moment For now however what needs to be registered for us to understand the status of the feminine in relation to the films ethical project is that the truth of the phallus is the truth that the subject is always already a prosthetic subject always in need of the supplement provided by pre cisely that which is castrating in the first place namely the Symbolic thus generatingin contrast to Cavellian skepticisma constitutively unbalanced psychic economy driven by what Žižek calls the loop of symbolic castration 135 The fundamental prosthetics of subjectiv ity are registered and thematized in all sorts of obvious ways in the film Most obvious of all is the conspicuous fact of Selmas failing eyesight and the various strategies used to supplement it the crib sheet she uses at her visit to the eye doctor for example which she memorizes so that she can pretend to read the eye chart and keep her job the Cokebottle eyeglasses that she shares with her son Gene like a prosthetic supple when you cant believ e your eyes or voice ment to the already natural and complete motherson bond which fall to the floor in a cut shot at the moment of her hanging as if to sug gest that only in death does one escape the prosthetics of subjectivity and the fact that the natural originary state of being sighted can be achieved for Gene only by means of surgical interventiona kind of literalization of the Freudian notion of retroactive causality Other ex amples abound Most fascinating of all perhaps is the scene in which Selma and Kathy attend the movies to watch a Hollywood musical Here however watching the film takes the following form Kathy tells Selma in a verbal blowbyblow what is going on on the screen that she cannot see only to have that linear account interrupted by a run ning argument that erupts with another patron a few rows up who is irritated by her talking For Selma watching the film consists of see ing nothing and hearing a sound track overwritten by a verbal account derailed by a shouting matchall of which it should be added she glee fully takes in as if its better than seeing the film normally This scene invokes the central prosthetic thematization of the filmhow with failing sight the realm of sound becomes more and more Selmas way to bring the world nearer to use the Emersonian phrase invoked by Cavella fact painfully evoked in Selmas jail cell on death row as she desperately presses her ear to the ventilation grate in the deafening silence trying to hold on to one last aural thread of the world around her At this precise juncture however it is crucial to insist on the difference between what the prosthetic relations of vi sion and sound mean to Selma and what they mean to the film the better to understand the ethical project that drives the films use of Selma as a character and a vehicle For what cannot be missed by any viewer I think is the striking even jarring difference between how the film is shot inside and outside Selmas fantasy musical scenes with the inside scenes in vivid color carefully in fact remarkably choreographed and edited with footage taken reportedly from one hundred digital cameras used to film each sequence and the outside scenes presented in washedout sepia tones in the best cinema verité documentary style Now the point here is not some untenable distinction between the cooked and the raw the artful and the authentic the medi ated and the umediated and so on but rather the films startling and when you cant believ e your eyes or voice principled insistence on this visual difference All of which we must re member is framed by a question of genre namely why the Hollywood musical as the generic mode of Selmas fantasies The most succinct answer I think is to say that for Selma the Hollywood musical uses music song and voice to prosthetically assume the functions of cog nitive mapping to use Fredric Jamesons wellworn phrase usually reserved in the humanistic tradition as we saw in chapter 5 for the visual in which the world presents itself in evidence as it were before the gaze of the centered subject around which the world of tables and chairs or in Gene Kellys case umbrellas coalesces In psycho analytic terms in the Hollywood musical it is as if the fantasy structure of normal vision itself is laid bare For Lacan on the other hand If I am anything in the picture it is always in the form of the screen    the stain the spot in the scopic field he continues the gaze is outside it belongs as Stephen Melville puts it succinctly not to the small o other but to the Otherlanguage world the fact of a movement of sig nification beyond human meaning26 In Lacans analysis opacity rather than transparency constitutes the structure of visuality But is not the world of the Hollywood musical above all a world that is not opaque a world of transparency where objectslike Fred Astaires mop in the fa mous dance numberare immediately meaningful and obey our every whim where the infirmity and foreignness of the body itself are sud denly transcended as we dance dance dance to borrow the lyrics from Dancers musical number Cvalda As we have seen it is precisely this willingness to hope against hope and believe against belief that is invoked by Cavell in viewing the musical and its dance as an escape from death as facing the music of skepticism by reaffirming the hopes of humanism But what I want to suggest is that part of the films geniusand certainly crucial to its emotional torqueis that it allows Selmas romantic indeed melo dramatic deployment of this solution to her loss of vision as a means of ensuring the worlds consistency while at the same time the film deconstructs that solutionspecifically in how the film outside of Selmas fantasy world is shot For what the film insists on rigorously and systematically is the difference between Selmas vision of the world and the subjects centered place in it as constituted by fantasy and what the world looks like when those fantasies and identifications when you cant believ e your eyes or voice are suspendedwhen they are as it were subjected to analysis In so doing the film uses the pathological fact of Selmas blindness and the compensatory strategies it generates to disclose a radically de constructed notion of the visual very much along the lines of Žižeks gloss on Malbranche with the point being as I put it in chapter 5 with Derrida not that only those who cannot see can see but that even those who cannot see cannot see The films most important musical number Ive Seen It All would seem to register this theoretical point about fantasy and identifi cation very much in the terms discussed by Žižek in his gloss on MUDs multipleuser domains on the Internet that the point of the Lacanian notion of the split or decentered subject is not that there are simply more EgosSelves in the same individual with which one might iden tify but that this decentering is of the void of the subject itself as derailed and constituted by the Symbolic and by the phallus as signifier its hollowing out by the signifier as Lacanians like to say in relation to its content to the bundle of imaginary andor symbolic identifi cations Here we might revisit Selmas repeated rejections in Ive Seen It All of the further identifications held out to her by Jeff of wife of grandmother and so on In her repeated insistence that Ive seen all I need to see the film registers the fact that the subjects division is not the division between one Self and another between two contents but the division between something and nothing between the feature of identi fication and the void27 In this light we can understand Selmas rigor ous insistence that further identifications seeing more in the songs terms will change nothing as a kind of unflinching posthumanisma point punctuated one might say as Selma removes her glasses at the beginning of the number and tosses them into the water then mo ments later wraps her arms around herself and falls to the ground in a fetal position dangerously suicidally near the passing train as a final answer to Jeffs repeated calls for further other identifications with the roles of wife grandmother and so on made available to her To return however to how the film is shot what makes the film posthumanist is that it mobilizes the investment in a traditional fan tasy of vision through its thematization in the story of Selma but at the same time divorces visuality from transcendence identity and the ego around whom visual space might be organized in its cinema when you cant believ e your eyes or voice verité camera work This apparent realism however does not oper ate to put us in touch with some unmediated relationship with the way things are that as we saw with Silvermans critique of aural and visual transcription is not in the cards but instead is calculated to insist that if we ask What does the world look like the answer can only be It doesnt look like anything at alla fact we may index to the films conspicuous foregrounding of the apparent contingency governing the camera work itself This jarring but crucial contrast is prepared for in the films opening moments in the juxtaposition of the operatic overture and its painterly affirmation of subjectcentered vision followed immediately by the mundane local audition for The Sound of Music filmed in a nearly distracting handheld style What all of this suggests is that we are to take the fantasy scenes with their vivid coloration and careful choreography as in the visually stun ning Ive Seen It All or the complexly woven Cvalda in contrast to the devilmaycare shooting and washedout color of the everyday scenesas more real than the documentary reallife scenes from which they supposedly departand that this is precisely their problem To put it in psychoanalytic terms the world paradoxically comes to life only through fantasy but it is the subjects very fantasy itself that bars her from what is really going on in the world itself which obeys its own laws and doesnt look like the subjects desire or anybody elses This doesnt mean that fantasy is being disavowed as if one could escape it only that it is being carefully situated and in a way specific to the medium of film To modify Cavells wonderful insight we might say that film may be what the world looks like when were not there but its not what the world looks like when nobodys there Thats why it doesnt look like anything at all If we want to think of this in deconstructive rather than psycho analytic terms the film might be said to enact what Laura Oswald has called the strategy of cinemagraphia which identifies cinema with those traces of nonpresence such as the splice the cut or the frame that draw attention to the endless productiondeconstruction of the meaning and subject of film discourse across the film frame In so doing cinemagraphia shatters the mirror in which the subject is held as a unity by defining the image as a trace for another image thus exposingand here one might readily think of Dancers relation when you cant believ e your eyes or voice to the Hollywood musical and its techniquesmimesis as the endless pursuit of an illusion28 Cinemagraphia thus subjects the cinematic field to the deconstructive force of what Derrida called the spatial As Derrida characterizes itin remarks that have obvious resonance with our earlier discussion of Žižeks gloss on Malebranche and the prostheticthe painter or the drawer is blind    the hand that paints and draws is the hand of a blind personit is an experience of blind ness Thus the visual arts are also arts of the blind which is to say that the visual is always subjected to the force the spatial which is hetero geneous to the space of the centered subject of humanist visuality29 The spatializing effect of cinemagraphia thus operates wholly counter to the cinematic practice of suture as popularly theorized in 1980s film theory in which the primary identification of the spec tator with the film image by means of the look parallels the childs identification with his or her other and the mOther in the mirror phase of development so that the spectator internalizes the subject positions of characters in the diegesis Cinemagraphia on the other hand shatters the mirror in which the subject is held as unity by de fining the image as a trace for another image30 For this reason as Peter Brunette and David Wills have put it what we find in cinema is the deconstruction of the mimetic operation rather than the con firmation of it and it is in this sense that the screen can be called a hymen As Oswald characterizes it the hymen corresponds to the elusive trace of the film frame joiningseparating elements of the film chain constructingdeconstructing meaning and subjectaddress in film discourse 260 In this lightor in this space perhaps we should now saywe might well take issue with Silvermans impatience with Derridas use of the cognate term invagination which Silverman writes has tended to obscure rather than to foreground the ways in which texts engender their readers and viewers because it is exploited primarily as rhe torical currency In the understanding I am pursuing here nothing would seem to be further from the truth Indeed Derridas rendering of invagination in the essay Living On Border Lines contends that the invaginated structure of all discourse is necessarily repressed by any law by the authorities who demand an author an I capable of or ganizing a narrative sequence of remembering and telling the truth when you cant believ e your eyes or voice Such is the demand for the story he continues the narrative the demand that society the law that governs literary and artistic works medicine the police and so forth claim to constitute This demand for truth is itself recounted and swept along in the endless process of invagination31 The point Derrida is making here as I understand it is that invagination is not merely a rhetorical gesture but quite the contrary is crucial to understanding the relation of sexual difference to questions of institution and lawa point that has obvious relevance for our understanding of a film in which the feminine is subjected to the power of the law in the form of capital punishment What I want to suggest now in combining Derridas rendering of invagination with the psychoanalytic frame of Žižek is that the castration of Selma by blindness and hanging in the film which some reviewers have seen as nothing short of a sadistic manipulation of the audience by the films director operates not only in the service as Silverman would argue of a displacement and projection of preOedipal losses onto the feminine by a phallic regime but rathera much stronger and more complicated ethical project on the films partas the rendering of what Žižek calls the act as feminine Here again as with my earlier discussion of the phallus as signi fier we must revisit according to Žižek one of the most notoriously antifeminist theses of the late Lacan that woman is a symptom of man32 Things look quite different Žižek argues if we focus more carefully on just what the term symptom means in the late Lacan namely as a particular signifying formation which confers on the sub ject its very ontological consistency enabling it to structure its basic constitutive relationship to enjoyment jouissance In these terms the thesis woman is a symptom of man means that man himself exists only through woman qua his symptom all his ontological consistency hangs on is suspended from his symptom is externalized in his symptom In other words man literally exsists his entire being lies out there in woman Woman on the other hand does not exist she insists In this way Žižek continues the relationship to the death drive is also reversed woman taken in herself outside the relation to man embodies the death drive apprehended as a radical most ele mentary ethical attitude of uncompromising insistence    Woman is therefore no longer conceived as fundamentally passive in contrast to when you cant believ e your eyes or voice male activity the act as such in its most fundamental dimension is feminine 156 This is why for Lacan suicide is the epitome of the act considered in this radical ethical dimension it involves a kind of temporary eclipse of the subject in which I put at stake everything including myself my symbolic identity the act is therefore always a crime a transgressionit is mad in the sense of radical un accountability In this act of annihilation we not only dont know what will come out of it its final outcome is ultimately even insignifi cant strictly secondary in relation to the no of the pure act 44 We are now better equipped to understand in a more profound way the ethical project of Dancer in the Dark and how that project might well be the source of the intense polarization of the films audience What is most disturbing about Selmas plight is not that she commits a crime indeed this is merely the motivation of the device as the Russian formalists used to say for the films handling of the relation of the feminine the act and the Law What is far more disturbing and far more ethically significant is her radical passivity in the face of her condemnation even as her friends scurry about in masculine activ ity as Žižek would say to gather new information about her situation contact lawyers and so on Selma herself however chooses to do noth ing and it is this passivity this nowhich culminates of course in her choosing to diethat most forcefully exposes the utter injustice and contingency of the Law the fact that the Law functions precisely to actively and indeed one might now say hysterically cover over the fact that it is constructed across a void All of which helps to explain an intuition that nearly all viewers of the film are bound to share that the most unsatisfactory ending imaginable would be precisely that which is most reasonable Selma using the recovered money to hire a lawyer reopen the case and win her acquittal which would only serve to collapse the very abyss between justice and Law that has been opened up in the film by means of the act as feminine From this vantage we can now understand the full significance of the conspicuous fact in the film of Selmas absent husband curi ously unremarked and unexplained her rejection of Jeffs repeated overtures senselessly as it were and her reclaiming and renam ing of her own nameofthe father in terms of her own psychic co ordinates pretending that he is named Olrich Novy a famous comedic when you cant believ e your eyes or voice songanddance man from her homeland here played by Joel Gray in an altogether unexpected and not entirely successful cameo Here we might say even more pointedly that the father of Gene is not just an absent father he is also lacking and his role has been assumed by Selma whose embodiment of the act as feminine is the films supreme example of ethical agency In these terms Selma assumes the phallic function par excellence in passing on to her son the gift of vision33 but what the father mother passes on to her son is vision without paternal Law vision under the sign of the prosthetic as the very truth of the subjecta fact indexed by the conspicuous oversized eyeglasses that mother and son share as a kind of visual albatross Here we find as David Wills puts it in his wonderful meditation Prosthesis the body as a whole as metonymic signifier of the phallus called into question by means of the prosthesis in which the relation to the other becomes precisely and necessarily a relation of otherness the otherness for ex ample of artificiality attached to or found within the natural a fact neatly indexed here in that Genes natural condition of sight can only exist through prosthetic surgical intervention The relation to the other Wills concludes is thus denied the reconfirmation of same ness that freezes its differential effect rigidifies the oedipal structure and ultimately represses the feminine the homosexual and so on34 What we find here then is a subjection of vision to the force of the prosthetic itself in Selmas assumption of the phallic function of passing along sight to her son And this in turn must now be mapped in terms of the multiple valences of the films posthumanist ethical proj ect of the act as feminine and its exposure of the Laws facticity of the rescripting of the phallic subject as always already prosthetic and of the tearing away of the visual as such from its association with the ontological privilege of the subject Here again we must pay attention to the difference between the films vantage on this drama and Selmas own Selma may think that the vision she is bequeathing to her son is the ability to see a world that looks the way her fantasies doa world that is in a word beautifulbut the film has long since insisted that the world outside Selmas fantasy the world she merely inhabits will not look like anything in particular at all From the films vantage she doesnt hand down to her son her world in other words but simply a worldvision without the phallus and with no guarantees Indeed when you cant believ e your eyes or voice to put it paradoxically we could say that Selma hears in the aural do main the truth of the visual as she frantically listens at the ventilation grate in her cell for any sound at all Here the signposts for the subject on the way to the void are clear music then noise then silence In this light as Žižek puts it in his writing on David Lynch the flatness of reality that we find in various forms of visual representa tion PreRaphaelite painting for instance effectively cancels the per spective of infinite openness that we associate with the Newtonian Cartesian worldview and finds its counterpart in a certain ontological or primordial concept of noise that is constitutive of space itself it is not a noise in space but a noise that keeps space open as such the very texture that holds reality togetherif this noise were to be eradicated reality itself would collapse This noise is therefore in a sense Žižek concludes the very sound of silence35 It is this noise this very texture of reality that Selma listens for in her jail cell having now been deprived of music noise at the moment before it passes over as it is bound to do for Selma into music into a kind of becoming voice that reassures the subject that she still exists What I am suggest ing then is that in the end Dancer in the Dark stages the problem of sound and voice in terms that are amenable to Cavell and to the rather different analyses of Žižek and Derrida and it does so by means of a double articulation that insists on the fundamental difference between Selmas psychic drama and the films larger project Selmas drama may indeed be read in terms of the topos of Cavellian skepticism the loss of the world thematized through Selmas blindness that enableseven necessitates one might saythe recovery of another world flush with this one a world organized around the subject into which we may step under the guidance or spur as it were of the voice For the film however this drama is quite clearly reframed as only fantasy For Selma as character sound is always already crossing over into a musi cality that is further circumscribedmade all the more melodious one might sayin terms of the Hollywood musical and its conven tions but for the film music is a kind of postCagean phenomenon in which the difference between music and sound is uncertain and un stable posed anew each moment in the clacking of train tracks the clamor of the factory floor and the scratching of the courtroom sketch artists pencil when you cant believ e your eyes or voice of Björk herself which seems to have more in common with the film and director you might say than with Selma the character What I am tempted to call the posthumanist voice of Björks performance ranges rapidly and without warning from the operatic to the flatly verbal to the almost guttural and all points in between as if the voice itself were one minute the disembodied transmission of spirit as Cavell might have it and the next minute a sampling of various sounds styles and mannerisms not all of them what we usually think of as vocal music at all What Björks vocal style seems to emphasize at such moments is not so much that voice floats free of the world and points to another better one adjacent to this one as Cavell would have it but that voice is always already hollowed out as Lacan would say by sound that stain or thing that forms the undissolvable residuum of enjoyment that the phallusasprosthesis at once generates and attempts to gen trify It is as Žižek would put it the remainder of the voice that para doxically comes before the voice Here we find a concept of voice that is diametrically opposed to what I have called Cavells Selmacentric one Indeed from Žižeks perspective voice as we find it in the operatic aria provides perhaps the neatest exemplification of what Lacan calls jouissense enjoymeant the moment at which sheer selfconsuming enjoyment of the voice eclipses meaning the words of the aria36 For Žižek voiceand this is dramatized in the transition from silent film to early talkiesfunctions as a strange body which smears the innocent surface of the picture a ghostlike apparition which can never be pinned to a definite visual object37 Here we find an explanation for Charlie Chaplins wellknown aversion to sound which is thus not to be dismissed as a simple nostalgic commitment to a silent paradise it reveals a far deeper than usual knowledge or at least presentiment of the disruptive power of the voice of the fact that the voice functions as a foreign body as a kind of parasite introducing a radical split38 Here then on the site of voice we can not only move toward a provisional summation of the theoretical and ethical stakes involved in Dancer in the Dark but also greatly enhance our understanding of one of the most important junctures in postmodern philosophy by using Žižek to triangulate the wellknown disagreement between Derrida and Cavell over the question of ordinary language philosophy of which when you cant believ e your eyes or voice the problem of voice may now be seen as but an especially pitched mo ment Here we need to recall however briefly the most explicit epi sode of all in this triangulationnamely Cavells disagreement with Derridas reading of Austin in Limited Inc and beyond that his critique of voice as we find it in Derridas early book on Husserl Derridas cri tique of voice as exemplary of logocentrism and the metaphysics of presence from the early work on Husserl through Of Grammatology and on to his later work is surely too wellknown to need restatement here What is less known perhaps is Cavells response which will serve to link him in an odd and unexpected way though finally not a decisive one with Žižek Cavells reading takes place over many pages chiefly in A Pitch of Philosophy and is often complex and technical centering on Derridas understanding of concepts in Austin such as felicity force signa ture andthe one for which Austin is best knownthe performa tive To put it schematicallyand I have already explored this diver gence in somewhat different terms in chapter 3the gist of Cavells objection is that he finds Derrida misreading Austins philosophical project even though for Cavell both Austin and Derrida seem to be brothers in arms against the metaphysical tradition As Cavell elo quently puts it Both are philosophers of limitation both interested in the morality and politics of speech out of something like a shared sense that concepts without the most scrupulous attention impose and are imposed upon us and both take the struggle against metaphysics as a struggle for liberation for something more than reason as it were itself Most sig nificantly perhaps there is an appreciation of the fact Austins analysis of the performative may be seen to be motivated precisely as an attack on what deconstruction attacks under the name logocentrism39 The question for Cavell is this why does Derrida not recognize his common cause with Austin and find in him instead an example of the metaphysical tradition against which Cavell sees both aligned For Cavell the answer is that Derrida is blinded by his toohasty aver sion to voice although voice for Austin and for Wittgenstein means the voice of the everyday or the ordinaryand they call it this ac cording to Cavell precisely to contrast their appeal with the appeal to when you cant believ e your eyes or voice metaphysics More than thisand this I think is the nub of the issue for CavellDerrida is every bit as opposed    to the metaphysical voice as Austin and Wittgenstein are But he makes it his business to monitor and to account for its encroachments while seeming    to be speaking in it no one more cheerfully in a voice that suggests its final overcoming that is that suggests that it will end philosophi cally 62 In the end then Cavell finds Derridas critique of Austins concept of voiceasmetaphysical to be in fact exemplary of the metaphysical voice at work in Derrida himselfthe metaphysical explicitly as a flight from the ordinary and its vexations into what one might call system atic philosophy As Cavell puts it in Philosophical Passages What I think Derrida is objecting to here is something he was already in flight from the specter of the ordinary which manifests itself in Derridas repeated gestures that of course he is not denying that there are ef fects of the ordinaryincluding most famously signatureswhich for Cavell furthers the air of implication that there is something more to doa further reality to assess a fullness of certainty to applythan human beings can compass 74 And in so doing Derrida for Cavell exemplifies the philosophical desire to silence the voice of the ordinary and the everyday exemplifies the desire in a somewhat different reg ister to transcend the human in the most homely and downtoearth sense of the term My concern at the moment is not to register my agreement or res ervations about Cavells reading of Derrida but to point out that a cer tain understanding of what we might think of as the unavoidability of the problem of voice links Žižek to this aspect of Cavell through what one might call a materialist gesture over and against the critique of phonocentrism in Derrida For both Žižek and Cavell the voice in sists it obtrudes we cannot free ourselves of it through critique or deconstruction or anything else More important however is how this fact helps sharpen our sense of the difference between Cavells humanist voice and the rather different understanding made available by Žižek For both the presence of the voice may be coterminous with everything that makes us human but for Žižek that human turns out to be inhabited at its core by the inhuman Thing that resides at the heart of the humanist subject To put it telegraphically for Cavell the when you cant believ e your eyes or voice fear or danger is over the loss of voice but for Žižek the fear or danger is precisely that the voice can never be losta point he makes in ex plicit contrast to Derridas reading of phonocentrism What Derrida remains blind to Žižek writes is the radical ambiguity of the voice The voicephenomenon in its very presence is simultaneously the Lacanian Real the nontransparent stain that puts an irreducible ob stacle in the way of the subjects selftransparency a foreign body in its midst In short the greatest hindrance to the selftransparency of Logos is the voice itself in its inert presence40 But if a certain materialist gesture links Cavell and Žižek on the question of the voice over and against what Cavell sees as Derridas metaphysical bent what Žižek has called his quasitranscendental side 195 that is not I think the whole story What is at issue here is also the disposition of that materialism and on those grounds Žižek and Derrida must be paired in sharp contrast with Cavells humanism We can bring this difference into focus by heeding Cavells assertion in The World Viewed on silent film that the world is silent to us the silence is merely forever broken 15051 What this silence registers for Cavell of course is our distance from the world under skepticism a silence merely forever broken by our words that can never bridge that distance can never be words of the world How different this is from Žižeks analysis of primordial or ontological sound in David Lynch where what is registered is instead that the world is never silent and that this noisiness which is also a queasiness is an index of our inability to achieve distance from the world of things and the Real It is precisely this factthat the Thing is in the subject more than the subject itselfthat generates the overarching prosthetic logic of the phallus as master signifier which then dialectically generates through its failure to gentrify the Real the very residuum of the Thing the stain and so on that constitutes the Symbolics raison dêtre Or to put it in Žižekian shorthand no meaning without enjoyment and no enjoyment without nauseating remainder What becomes clear here then is that for Žižek and Derrida the disposition of this materialism is handled in and through différance through the Master the phallus as signifier in which subject and ob ject are enfolded to return to the ethical topos of the feminine in an es sentially invaginated relationship whereas in Cavell their difference when you cant believ e your eyes or voice and distance are as Derrida might say too pure Indeed it is that purity of distance that calls forth the voice as in operatic aria which registers either ecstasy at overcoming that distance or melancholy at its unsurpassability41 But the larger point I wish to make is this the question here is one not simply of materialismof counterposing the ordinary or the Real to the supposed formalism of deconstruction but more importantly of the prosthetic nature of the ordinary and the everyday itself42 To put it another way materialism itself is not a pure category that stands in its purity in opposition to formalism or idealism but is instead itself constituted by difference by enfolding and being enfolded within that which it is not43 And on this point the decisive difference is between not Žižek and Derrida on one side and Cavell on the other but between Žižek and Derrida themselves Žižek has offered in several places what he sees as Lacans ma terialist answer to Derrida and deconstruction44 In Tarrying with the Negative for instance he writes that Lacan accepts the deconstruc tionist motif of radical contingency but turns this motif against itself using it to assert his commitment to Truth as contingent45 More to the point for our purposes perhaps is the series of questions raised in Žižeks SelfInterview at the end of The Metastases of Enjoyment where he takes issue with Derridas failure to acknowledge fully the ultimate identity of supplement and MasterSignifier For Derrida Žižek writes the supplement is the undecidable margin that eludes the MasterSignifier whereas Lacan    locates this undecidability in the very heart of the MasterSignifier    The MasterSignifier proper emerges through the neutralization of the supplement through the obliteration of its constitutive indecidability whereas Derrida insists on the reduction of the Lacanian Symbolic to the balanced economy of exchangereferenced to the gold standard as it were of the phallusand in so doing fails to take note of how in his own theo retical edifice the notion of gift of a primordial there is    intro duces an aspect that is heterogeneous to the standard Derridean prob lematic of différancetracewriting as presence itself in its ultimate inaccessibility46 To acknowledge as much however is to realize instantly that the point cuts both ways Žižeks reinterpretation of the phallusand therefore of the ethics of the act as feminineis possible only by when you cant believ e your eyes or voice virtue of an understanding of the phallus as signifier whose status as such is crucial if Žižek is to avoid the alltooobvious objection that the Lacanian Real may be characterized more pointedly than any term we have thus far queried as positing a form of metaphysical materi alism to quote Derrida which posits an ultimate referent or be comes an objective reality absolutely anterior to any work of the mark the semantic content of a form of presence which guarantees the movement of the text in general from the outside47 Žižek may dif ferentiate Lacanian theory from poststructuralism by means of truth as contingent but as Judith Butler has repeatedly noted By linking this contingency with the real and interpreting the real as the trauma induced through the threat of castration the Law of the Father this law is posited as accountable for the contingency in all ideological determinations but is never subject to the same logic of contingency that it securesin which case Žižeks theory thus evacuates the con tingency of its contingency48 This is a rather different point from the critique we saw Derrida making of Lacan in chapter 2 and it is crucial for assessing Žižeks rela tionship not only to poststructuralism but also to feminism As Butler asks in a rhetorical question if ever there was one Is there not a dif ference between a theory that asserts that in principle every discourse operates through exclusion and a theory that attributes to that outside specific social and sexual positions 189 as in Lacanian theorys as sociation of the feminine body with the domain of the Real the Thing the stain and so on Here in other words everything hinges on the deconstructive valence of Žižeks account of the phallusasprosthesis as long asand only as long aswe insist on the phallus as signifier and subject the Law to an essentially deconstructive understanding we are able to move Žižek away from the consequences ferreted out by Butler Only then can we sustain the ethical transvaluation of the feminine for psychoanalytic theory that Žižek wants to pursue49a transvalua tion that might make common cause with Butlers own theorization of the plasticity of the phallus as directly linked to its status as signi fier in a structure that has to be reiterated and as reiterable becomes open to variation and plasticity thus opening sexual difference as a site of proliferative resignifications as in for example Butlers own theorization of the lesbian phallus 89 Of course to arrive at such when you cant believ e your eyes or voice in Žižek requires insisting on the very deconstructive reading of the phallus that he wants to simultaneously criticize and mobilize All of which would seem willfully perverse orwe are now in a position to saynecessarily prosthetic What Žižek helps us to see then is that in Dancer in the Dark we find a powerful posthumanist project that unhinges the humanist coordinates of vision in relation to spatiality and voice in relation to noise while poignantly staging their fantasy structures glossed so well by Cavell And he helps disclose as Cavells work does how those structures are deployed in specific ways by the genres and conventions of film as a medium More decisively in relation to Cavells work he gives us an even sharper sense of how the film undertakes this mobi lization and undoing of those visual and vocal modes in terms not so much of the total animal sensorium and its many modes of being in the world that I discussed in chapters 2 3 and 5 or even in this last in questioning the distinction between disability and normality but rather in drawing out the radical sense of the feminine and its ethical force in the film its assault on the regime of the phallus and the Law its perverse and devastating force But in evacuating the contingency of its contingency to use Butlers phrase in not fully confronting the consequences of that contingency as necessitating a fundamentally different critical logic that forces us beyond the simple dialectical reversal and elevation of the terms banished by humanism to subservient status the Real the Thing the feminine and so on Žižeks work remains within the purview of the very humanism that his radical sense of the feminine wants to eclipse In doing so it stops short of the full articulation of the feminine in another even deeper sense its invaginated relationship with prostheticity that obeys a fundamentally different posthumanist logic The work of art is an ostentatiously improbable occurrence niklas luhmann Art as a Social System Downsview Park Koolhaas and Maus Tree City The five remarkable finalists for the muchpublicized Toronto Parc Downsview Park competition of 2000a design for a 320acre site on a former military base Canadas first national urban parkare of course proposals for works in architecture landscape architecture though that difference as I will suggest later appears to be of some moment particularly in the winning entry1 They are also remark able for another reason as experiments in how to think anew the re lationship between nature and culture orto use a distinction I bor rowed a few years ago from the political scientist Tim Lukebetween green and gray ecologies2 Indeed one might ask what else can the seemingly innocuous phrase urban park mean at this moment in time other than this very necessity Green ecologies ecologies of the organic the living the biomass and gray ecologies of the machinic and technological the electronic Or to put it in the terms used by Bernard Tschumis proposal for Downsview ecologies of the coyote and ecologies of the digital3 In fact how the Tschumi proposal handles the term digital is a good example of what I mean On the one hand it refers to electroni cally mediated mass culture based on binary coding the sort of thing associated with the large image screens that are a central part of his design on the other hand the digital harkens back etymologically to the digits the fingers Here it would be temptingand entirely to the pointto recall Jacques Derridas reading of the figure of the hand in relation to the natureculture opposition in Heidegger that was lose the building discussed in earlier chapters In Derridas Geschlecht II Heideggers Hand for example the hand stands as we have seen as a symptom of Heideggers alltooproblematic ontological opposition of the world of the human and the world of the animal For Heidegger the mean ing of the hand properly understood is determined not by biological or utilitarian functiondoes not let itself be determined as a bodily organ of gripping4but by its expression of the geschlecht or species being of humanity which in opposition to the rest of creation rests on the human possession of speech and thought which in turn opens an abyss between the grasping or prehension associated with the prehensile organs of the ape5 and the hand of man which is far from these in an infinite way unendlich through the abyss of its being6 To misunderstand the hand of the human as determined by util ity and function is to repeat the sin of Western conceptualizing as a kind of sublimized violence as Stanley Cavell has put it a sort of clutching or grasping through what we might call prehensile conceptualization This mode of violence is most famously thematized in Heidegger of course as the violence expressed in the world do minion of technology7 For the matter at hand at hand we could scarcely do better than to remember Heideggers aversion to the type writer and typographic mechanization which is asignifying because it loses the hand as Heidegger puts it in its anonymous standardiza tion and in its spacing of elements it destroys the unity of thinking speaking and writing And thus Heidegger laments In typewriting all men resemble one another8 For Heidegger then the proper sub servience of the technological to the human rests on a prior ontological opposition between the natural and the human the prehensile and the comprehensile we might say here figured pointedly as the difference between the Man of the Hand and to return to Tschumi the Coyote who is condemned forever to wander between the ontological orders of the stone at one end of the Heideggerian universe and the world of spirit of being as such that is proper only to the human at the other Remembering Heidegger on technology helps throw into relief as well the very different and distinctly contemporary reconjugation of the technical and the natural that we find in the Downsview Park proposals We could call this reconjugation postmodern I suppose to mark its opposition to Heideggers modernism but it seems to me that what is going on in the Downsview proposals is something dis tinct and different from the associations that usually cluster around that term Here the double take on the digital in Tschumis proposal is again suggestive for thinking about the proposals as a whole and it is useful to remember that the etymology of digit refers not only to the terminal divisions of the hand as the OED so sharply puts it but also to a unit of measurement used for example by the Romans In the Tschumi proposal the digital refers also to a perimeter landscape of earthworks that interlocks with the interior like the cupped fingers of the left and right handa figure that appears as well in the ravine structure proposed in the Brown and Storey entry They are fingers of nature that increase the interface between natural artifacts and cultural ones and can be compared to the fractal phenomenon of viscous fingering Indeed Tschumi and his collaborators argue The fractal dimension of all edges and interfaces in the Park is a crucial ele ment of our strategyhence the relevance of remembering the digit as a unit of measurebecause such fractal phenomena as John Casti puts it exhibit linear selfsimilarity in the sense that any part of the object is exactly like the whole that is to say they have exactly the same degree of irregularity at all scales of measurement9 The digital in Tschumis proposal points then in two differ ent directions and in doing so it provides a dense and compressed instance of a new way of theorizing the relations of nature and cul ture at work in the Downsview proposals as a whole Emergence selforganizational unfoldings circuit and throughflow ecologies sustaining and multiplying complexity over time webs of strong attractors and grammar strings open phasing functionbased circuit systems there are important differences between these con cepts but what they all have in common is that they thoroughly take for granted the conceptual apparatus of systems theory which is based on the central innovation of replacing the familiar ontological duali ties of the philosophical traditionchiefly for our purposes culture and naturewith the functional distinction between system and environment As we know from earlier chapters systems are selfreferential and selfproducingthey are autopoietic to use Maturana and Varelas termand they secure their autopoiesis by using distinctions based on lose the building a selfreferential constitutive code to selectively filter and respond to an environment that is always already infinitely more complex than any given system But what is important for our purposes at the mo ment is that there is a reciprocal relationship here of cospecification the environment is not simply given that would land us back into a thinly disguised concept of nature in the traditional sense but is in a crucial sense produced It is always the environment of the system the outside or unmarked space produced by the constitutive act of dis tinction and selection that any system uses to secure its operations As Niklas Luhmann succinctly puts it The environment receives its unity through the system and only in relation to the system    It is differ ent for every system because every system excludes only itself from its environment10 In this way what was previously a rigid uncrossable ontological boundary between two sides of the distinctionbetween nature and culture between the biological and the mechanical and so onis now made dynamic and as it were portable in the sense that the same formal mechanism may now be used to think and link across what were in the past discrete ontological domains For example this enables one to compare quite precisely thermoregulation in biological systems with the selfregulation of thermostatic mechanical systems or to model the firing of neurons and the behaviors of neuronal nets using digital technologies Now the pragmatic payoffs here would seem obvious enough for the attempts to think through the interlacing of ecological transporta tional and other systems in the Downsview proposals But what I wish to stress is not just a pragmatic and functional shift but a philosophical one as well in which the question of the relationship between nature and culture can now be deontologized and posed anew not as questions of what but as questions of how not as questions of substance but as questions of strategywhich has of course profound implications for the design process It is only in light of such a shift that we can make sense for example of Koolhaas and Maus contention in their winning Tree City entry that instead of restoring Downsview to a previous natural state Tree City manufactures nature for civic ends It is a fabri cated landscape    100 artificial and 100 natural    unambigu ously administrative in ambition AND entirely organic in spirit Here however we need to recall the important differences I have discussed in earlier chapters between firstorder and secondorder systems theory Firstorder systems theory is more typically concerned with processes of homeostasis positive feedback steering and the like think here of the work of Gregory Bateson or Norbert Wiener secondorder systems theory is concerned with complexity contin gency and how they relate to processes that now go by the names of emergence and selforganization In this light all the proposals are framed and informed not just by systems theory in some vague sense but specifically by secondorder systems theory Here the rhetoric of the Emergent Ecologies proposal of Corner and Allen could scarcely be more representative Our approach they write is emergent and dynamic an organizational matrix for the life of the site to unfold in which the landscape of circuits and flows simply guides or steers the always emergent processes of  matter and information Similarly Brown and Storeys Emergent Landscapes project proposes an evolving landscape of stages phases of order and stability a tableau of evolv ing relationships momentum and selforganizing structures Or fi nally Foreign Offices new synthetic landscape grows from the com mitment that faced with complexity we respond by sustaining and multiplying that complexity over time I do not mean to ignore the considerable differences between these proposals and the strategies they employ I intend simply to highlight the fact that embracing the paradigms of emergence and selforganization creates a new and in fact fundamental problem a medium associated above all with space now has as its constitutive problem time and temporalizationmore specifically how to tempo ralize design and the constraints and selections built into it What is threatened hereor promised depending on how one looks at itis that the architectural medium is thereby submitted to a kind of dema terialization or decomposition by the problem of time Hereand this is a question to which I will return in the final chapterthe problem of time cannot be separated from the question of specific media indeed what is brought into sharp focus in the relation of time and media is times own asynchronicity over and against what Louis Althusser once called an ideological concept of time as selfidentical seamless and continuous across all spaces Once we pay attention to specific media the problem of time in relation to design becomes a question of lose the building specific speeds and velocities and how to coordinate them biological and ecological elements and systems have certain rates of development change and decay of course but so do buildings and other structures which are subject to quite different speeds The Downsview entries confront this problem on a spectrum ranging from Foreign Office and Tschumi at one endwhich produce a tight coupling of temporal horizons and possible scenarios with rela tively hardwired structural commitments up front ones that predis pose some temporal horizons and not othersto Corner and Allen and Koolhaas and Mau at the other in which this relationship is one of relatively loose coupling This problem of time in relation to specific media framed of necessity by the embrace of the paradigm of emer gence is registered in an especially pointed way in the KoolhaasMau proposal in which the landscape will be prioritized over the realm officially known as architecture and which makes what is humor ously called the ultimate sacrifice of the construction of costly new buildings and devotes those resources instead to the temporalization of the designs meaning through a different medium with a different speed the vegetal In Tree City the reduction of hard commitments up front is a strategy for engaging in what Luhmann calls the temporalization of complexity11of how the complexity of the internal relations of the parks elements can remain responsive over time to changing and unanticipated demands from its surrounding environment To put it schematically power over space in the short run in the form of struc tures and buildings is swapped for power over time in the long run and thereforeto put perhaps too fine a point on ittime not space becomes the constitutive medium of the project In this sense the looseness or weakness of the coupling of temporal horizons and structural elements in Koolhaas and Mau is precisely its strength And from this vantage the constitutive question for the Downsview proj ect becomes something like Can you wait to which Tree City pro vides what we might think of as the slowest answer There is however a final less obvious relation between systems theory and the Downsview proposals at work here and that is the question of their relationship to different observational schema within what Luhmann calls functionally differentiated society To put it sche matically the park is not a thingcertainly not an objectbut rather an accretion of distinctions and selections made from within a par ticular observational system and its codea point registered in the jury reports concluding statement that Tree City outlines a vision of future park lands as intriguing as a work of art but also as malleable as communities of tomorrow could wish to find From this vantage the aesthetic or antiaesthetic of Koolhaas and Mau may be seen as a refusal of design composition pictorialism and the like in favor of a strategy of production and temporalization On the other hand Rem Koolhaas and Bruce Mau final panel art no 3 for Tree City 2000 lose the building howeverand I will explore this question in much more detail when I examine the Blur project of Diller  Scofidioinsofar as we are to regard these projects as something like art then those choices must be seen not only as aesthetic ones but quite exemplary aesthetic ones at that From one observational schema then the park may be viewed as a functional component of the larger urban space for which and in which it provides certain services in which case the question is not its autonomy but precisely the opposite how it functions as an element within a larger matrix of social systems of which it is part On the other hand it may be viewed as part of the social system of art in which case the question is precisely its autonomy and how that autonomy commu nicates the larger problem of the autopoiesis of art as a social system in functionally differentiated society If we keep in mind these differencesand keep in mind that they are irreducible that there is no totalizing perspective from which one observation may be subordinated to the otherthen the Park is quite literally a different entity depending on the observational schema we use which system we choose transportation economic aesthetic and so on as the lens through which to view the park as an agent of that systems autopoiesis And hence the design decisions about spe cific media in the proposalssay the use or refusal of the realm of ficially known as architecturetake on quite different functions and meanings depending on which observation we deploy It is this irre ducible difference between different observational schemas that is ad dressed most cannily by Koolhaas and Mau precisely because of what we might think of as Tree Citys weaknessits underspecification its refusal to commitwhich makes it more available to the autopoiesis of other systems in ways not precluded up front by choices made now This does not mean that there is no strategy to Tree City indeed this is its strategy At the same time however that underspecification must be justi fied on not merely functional but aesthetic grounds and it is here that the proposal of Koolhaas and Mau is cannily anti or postrepresenta tionalist in its refusal to try to do it all to include or represent the various elements of the society that surrounds it From this vantage the vantage of the Downsview projects seen now as communications within the social system of artthe temporal dimension of the pro simply the alibi for specific design decisions made right now as inter ventions in the contemporary fields of architecture design and art Viewed this way a major challenge faced by all the entriesand par ticularly by those that rely on a tight juxtaposition of the digital and the coyote to return to Tschumis terms or that deploy something like the dual mode of Foreign Officeis not so much the problem of composition but rather how that problem relates to a second one of thematization to which Koolhaas and Mau seem especially sensitive Once the natureculture distinction has been replaced by the sys temenvironment distinctionas is certainly the case with all these entriesthe problem then becomes how not to reproduce the histori cally founding and framing conundrum of what we might call the ideology of the park within the park itself In these termsbecause the systemenvironment distinction is operative at every level and has nothing to do with the apparently cognate distinction nature culturethe problem is not so much how to escape this conundrum as how to effectively displace it Here the entries that place a premium on the initial outlay of large architectural structures and gray ecologi cal spectacles face special challenges since they would seem to run a much greater risk of reinstating via thematization the very distinction between nature and the social thattheoretically at leastthey say has already been abandoned Theoretically speaking the outside pro duced by such architectural structuresthe unmarked space generated by their constitutive distinctions and selections that make them this structure and not some otherneed not have anything to do with the question of nature and in fact the relevance of those distinctions lies in the terms we are now using in relation to other architectural struc tures As Luhmann puts it A spatial position defines itself by providing access to other places Architecture determines how the context of the edifice is to be seen A sculpture defines its surrounding space12 And in this sense these projects run a greater risk of inviting the mistake we might say of a thematized reading that they in principle reject To put it another way as Luhmann does in Art as a Social System the question is how a work of art presents itself to perception in such a way as to be recognizable as artor in the case of Downsview Park how we would know we had wandered not only into a park and not lose the building some undesigned wasteland in the middle of the city but a park built now and not a hundred years ago As we will see later in the chapter the concept of form is crucial here and in it two requirements must be fulfilled and inscribed into perception the form must have a bound ary and there must be an unmarked space excluded by this boundary 45 This is obvious enough in works enclosed with a beginning and end as in narrative fiction a stage as in drama or a framing de vice But sculpture or architecture presents an entirely different case Luhmann argues Here the boundary does not draw the viewers attention inward but instead directs it outward The work permits no view into its depths no penetration of its surface whatever the surface may betray of the works mass volume or material The imaginary space is projected outward in the form of distinctions suggested by the work itself Here too space is workspecific space visible so long as the focus is on the work and disappearing from view when the focus shifts to surrounding objectsto the weeds in the castle garden 4546 It would be tempting at this juncture to invoke the wellknown distinction between the rhizomatic and arborescent in Deleuze and Guattaria reading suggested by what the jury report calls the mesh of connections cast over the surrounding area by Tree City Indeed one might very well view the project with its one thousand paths and what Bob Somol has characterized as its viral or cancer ous infection of the surrounding suburbs as an attempt to transform the arborescent Tree into the rhizomatic Tree City in a perversely humorous literalization whose primary message is Hey trees are as close to architecture as youre going to get in this project Indeed what is immediately most striking about the Koolhaas and Mau proposal is precisely its negativity its posture of refusal its repeated insistence on what it has opted not to do as much as what it doesin making the ul timate sacrifice of not doing architecture its refusal to spend money and so on And once this fundamental displacement is made it is as if everything in the proposal must now be read in quotation marks it is a kind of antiproposal or better still the kind of miming that Derrida as sociates with dissemination which is not an achievement of represen tationalism and mimesis but precisely its displacement and erosion13 This makes Tree City in the end a quite contemporary interven tion one very different from an earlier moment of the postmodern in architecture in which quotation and the like attempts as Luhmann puts it to copy a differentiated and diverse environment into the art work which in turn only raises the further problem of whether and in what way the work can claim unity and whether it can assert itself against its own  requisite variety14 How Luhmann asks can the art system reflect on its own differentiation not only in the form of theory but also in individual works of art In this light we might well view the mode of negativity and refusal of miming in the pro posal of Koolhaas and Mau as a kind of effort to displace any materi alization of a commitment that might temporally constrain and chain their project to a structural representation that ceases to be relevant the moment it comes into being And in thisto reach back now to Heidegger with whom we beganthe unhandsomeness of Tree City to use Stanley Cavells phrase is exactly what is most fetching about it it refuses to grasp and fix the present for us and in so doing it imag ines the futureor at least lets say a bit more modestly a future Diller  Scofidios Blur The kinds of formal innovations we find in Tree City what and how they signify how they mobilize an uncanny dematerialization of the architectural medium as part of a radical formal statement how they engage in an ingenious conceptual displacement of the problem of com position these form the fundamental concerns as well in my view of Ricardo Scofidio and Elizabeth Dillers audacious Blur project The Blur buildinga manufactured cloud with an embedded viewing deck hov ering over the Lake of Neuchâtel in Switzerlandseems to have en joyed nearly universal acclaim from the moment it opened to the public in October 2002 as part of Media Expo 02 The reasons for this are not far to seek they range from what a Swiss newspaper reviewer char acterized as the liberating effect of the zany cloud on the crotchety SwissWhat a crazy idiosyncratic thing How deliciously without purpose he exclaimedto Diller  Scofidios knowing deployment of the relationship between public architecture the history and function of the exposition as a social form and the manufacture and use of spec tacle in relation to both15 lose the building The project went through many different elaborations enhance ments and embellishments between the invitation to Diller  Scofidio to participate in July 1998 and the closing of the expo in October 2002 Almost all of these were for various reasons unrealized in the final project At one point the cloud was to house an LED text forest of vertical LED panels that would scroll texteither from an Internet feed including live chat produced by visitors to the structure or in a later version produced by an artist such as Jenny Holzer Blur 163 324 Another idea early on was an adjacent Hole in the Water restau rant made of submerged twin glass cylinders with an aquarium layer in between in which diners would sit at eye level with the lake and eat sushi 100111 Another was an openair Angel Bar embedded in the upper part of the cloud in which patrons could select from an end less variety of the only beverage served there waterartesian waters sparkling waters waters from both glacial poles and municipal tap waters from around the world tastings can be arranged we are told 14655 Yet another elaborate idea rather late in the projects evolu tion involved the distribution of smart raincoatsor braincoats to visitors to the cloud which would indicate through both sound and Diller Scofidio  Renfro Blur 2002 color affinity or antipathy to other visitors on the basis of a preferences questionnaire filled out upon entry to the cloud 20951 As even this brief list suggests the project went through many permutations In the endnot least for reasons of moneywhat we are left with in Blur is the manufactured cloud with the Angel Deck now not a water bar but a viewing deck nestled at its crest For rea sons I will try to explain by way of contemporary systems theory the fact that these permutations and sideline enhancements were not real ized in the end is not entirely a bad thing because it rivets our atten tion not only on what has captivated most viewers from the beginning but also on what makes the project a paradigmatic instance of how contemporary architecture responds to the complexities of its broader social environment in terms of its specific mediumand that is as Diller  Scofidio put it the radicality of an absent building 15 the remarkable audacious commitment to a building that was not a building at all but a manufactured cloud the making as they put it of nothing This fundamental commitment was sounded by Diller  Scofidio early and often at the core of the project as it were was no core at all but a commitment to something featureless depthless scaleless spaceless massless surfaceless and contextless 162 And this overriding concern was reiterated at the end of the design phase about a year before the expo opened in an important communiqué from Diller in which she writes BLUR is not a building BLUR is pure atmosphere water particles sus pended in midair The fog is a dynamic phantom mass which changes form constantly    In contradiction to the tradition of Expo pavilions whose exhibitions entertain and educate BLUR erases information Expos are usually competition grounds for bigger and better technologi cal spectacles BLUR is a spectacle with nothing to see Within BLUR vi sion is put outoffocus so that our dependence on vision can become the focus of the pavilion She adds in boldface type The media project must be liberated from all immediate and obvious metaphoric associations such as clouds god angels ascension dreams Greek mythology or any other kitsch rela tionships Rather BLUR offers a blank interpretive surface 325 Not quite blank as it turns out In fact on the conceptual side of lose the building the project the perceptual experience of the Blur building was thought by the architects at different stages in its development to either meta phorize or conversely throw into relief a larger set of dynamics around electronic media and how we relate to it Midway through the project in a presentation to a media sponsor they characterized it this way To blur is to make indistinct to dim to shroud to cloud to make vague to obfuscate Blurred vision is an impairment A blurry image is the fault of mechanical malfunction in a display or reproduction tech nology For our visually obsessed highresolutionhighdefinition cul ture blur is equated with loss    Our proposal has little to do with the mechanics of the eye but rather the immersive potential of blur on an environmental scale Broadcast and print media feed our insa tiable desire for the visual with an unending supply of images    but as an experience the Blur building offers little to see It is an immersive environment in which the world is put out of focus so that our visual dependency can be put into focus 195 At a different stageone in which the LED text forest played a central rolethe experience of the cloud figures the unimaginable magni tude speed and reach of telecommunications As Diller  Scofidio put it Unlike entering a building the experience of entering this hab itable medium in which orientation is lost and time is suspended is like an immersion in ether It is a perfect context for the experience of another allpervading yet infinitely elastic massless mediumone for the transmission and propagation of information the Internet The project aims to produce a technological sublime felt in the scaleless and unpredictable mass of fog16 There are some interesting differences here In the first version the resonance of the project falls on the iconographic and visually based forms of mass media in the second it is the ephemeral yet pervasive presence of electronic digital forms of telecommunication generally that is in question In the first the point of the cloud is that it deprives us of the unproblematic visual clarity immediacy and transparency that the mass media attempt to produce in consumers in the second the clouds water vapor metaphorically envelops us in the electronic ether that we inhabit like a medium in contemporary life but deprives us of the information that usually accompanies it and therefore dis tracts us from just how immersed in that medium we are What I am more concerned with here however is not the differences between the two accounts but what they have in common that this particular form has been selected by Diller  Scofidio and selected moreover to represent the unrepresentablehence the notion of the technological sublime on which both accounts converge We ought not however take this notion of the sublime or the term representation for that matter at face value In fact resorting to the discourse of the sublime here can only obscure the specificity of the projects formal decisionswhy it does what it does how it does and how those decisions are directly related to the ethical and political point that the project is calculated to make At its worst it leads down the sorts of blind alleys we find in the July 2002 issue of Architecture where one reviewer reads the project in terms of the symbolic sig nificance of clouds and of Switzerland in romantic literature Mary Shelleys Frankenstein among others and painting J M W Turner among others all of which is supposedly mobilized in Blurs rewriting of the sublime as a cautionary tale about the environment17 And all of which recycles exactly the sorts of immediate and obvious meta phoric associations and kitsch relationships that we rightly saw Diller railing against a moment ago It might seem more promising at least at first glance to pursue more adventurous renderings of the sublime in contemporary theory most notably in the work of JeanFrançois Lyotard though other recent renditions of the concept such as what we find in Slavoj Žižeks conju gation of Kant and Lacan might be invoked here as well In Lyotard to stay with the bestknown examplethe locus classicus is a certain reading of Kant The sublime is rendered as a kind of absolute outside to human existenceone that is for that very reason terrifying At the same time paradoxically and this is true of Žižeks rendering as well that radically other outside emerges as a product of the human subjects conflict with itself a symptom of the Enlightenment subject running up against its own limits In Lyotards famous rendering of the Kantian sublime in The Postmodern Condition it emerges from the conflict between the faculty to conceive of something and the faculty to present something We can conceive the infinitely great the infinitely powerful he explains but every presentation of an object destined to make visible this absolute greatness or power appears to lose the building us painfully inadequate Those are ideas of which no presentation is possible Therefore they impart no knowledge about reality experi ence18 The entire ethical stake of modern art for Lyotard then is to present the fact that the unpresentable exists To make visible that there is something which can be conceived and which can neither be seen nor made visible 78 But how to do this Here Lyotard follows Kants invocation of formlessness the absence of form as a possible index to the unpresentable as that which will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see it will please only by causing pain 78 The sublime then is a feeling that marks the incommensurability of reason conception and the singularity or particularity of the world and its objects presentation It is an incommensurability that carries ethical force for it serves as a reminder that the heterogeneity of the world cannot be reduced to a unified rule or reason And this incom pleteness in turn necessitates a permanent openness of any discourse to its other to what Lyotard elsewhere calls the differend19 Lyotards rendering of the Kantian sublime would seem to be use ful in approaching Blur and Kants invocation of formlessness as the sublimes index would seem doubly promising But its limitations may be marked by the fact that Kants sublime remains tethered to something on the order of a subject to use Foucaults famous phrasehence it remains referenced essentially to the language of phenomenology to the affective states of a subjectsupposedtoknow who in experienc ing her nonknowledge experiences pain and thus changes her relation to herself What I am suggesting then is that in Lyotards rendering of the sublimeand it would be far afield to argue the point in any more detail herethe price we pay for a certain deconstruction of the subject of humanism one that will be traced from Kant to Nietzsche in The Postmodern Condition20 is that the subject remains installed at the center of its universe only now its failure is understood be a kind of success Moreover that this failure is ethicalis the hook on which the ethical rehabilitation of the subject hangs in its forcible opening to the world of the object the differend and so onis the surest sign that we have not for all that left the universe of Kantian humanism We must remember that the ethical force of the sublime in Lyotards Kant de pends on the addressee of ethics being a member of the community of reasonable beings who must be equipped with the familiar humanist repertoire of language reason and so on to experience in the ethical imperative not a determinant synthesisnot onesizefitsall rules for the good and the just actbut an Idea of human society which is why Kant argues for example that we have no direct duties to non human animals21 This in turn reontologizes the subjectobject split that the discourse of the sublime was meant to call into question in the first place In contrast to this Diller  Scofidio insist that their work be understood in postmoral and postethical terms22 What this means I think is not that they intend their work to have no ethical or po litical resonancethat much is already obvious from their foregoing comments on Blurbut rather that they understand the relationship between art the subject and world in resolutely posthumanist terms That is to say in Diller  Scofidio the human and the non or anti or ahuman do not exist in fundamentally discrete ontological registers butquite the contraryinhabit the same postontological space in mutual relations of intrication and instability This boundary break down tends to be thematized in their broader body of work in the inter penetration of the human and the technological as in for example the multimedia theater work Jet Lag the VirtueVice Glasses series and the EJM 2 Inertia dance piece but it is also sometimes handled even more broadly in terms of the interweaving of the organic and the inorganic the natural and the artificial think here not only of Blur but also of projects like Slow House or The American Lawn Sometimes those unstable relations are funny sometimes they are frightening but al most always the signature affect in Diller  Scofidios work is radical ambivalencean ambivalence that in contrast to the sublime isnt about a clearcut pain that becomes in a second pedagogical moment pleasure but rather an ambivalence that is tied to the difficulty of knowing exactly what is being experienced as in works that intermesh real video surveillance with staged scenes for example in the Facsimile installation at Moscone Center in San Francisco or how we should feel about it think here of Jump Cuts or again Blurall of which leads in turn to the ultimate question namely Who is doing the experiencing Who in phenomenological and in political terms are we exactly In this light Diller  Scofidio like Lyotards Kant show us how ques tions of ethics are just that questions but they do so unlike Lyotards lose the building Kant without recontaining the force of that radical undecidability in terms of a humanist subject an alltoofamiliar wea reasonable being directed toward an idea of societyfor whom and only for whom those questions are What this suggests is that a move beyond an essentially human ist ontological theoretical framework is in order if we are to under stand the Blur project or indeed Diller  Scofidios work as a whole We need in other words to replace what questions with how questions to use Niklas Luhmanns shorthand23 Here recent work in systems theoryparticularly Luhmanns later workcan be of im mense help not least because it gives us a theoretical vocabulary for understanding the sorts of things that Diller  Scofidio have in mind when they suggest that in Blur our objective is to weave together ar chitecture and electronic technologies yet exchange the properties of each for the other Blur 44 The fundamental postulate of systems theoryits replacement of the familiar ontological dichotomies of hu manism culturenature and its cognates mindbody spiritmatter reasonfeeling and so on with the functional distinction system environmentis indispensable in allowing us to better understand the sorts of transcodings that Diller  Scofidio have in mind because it gives us a theoretical vocabulary that can range across what were in the humanist tradition ontologically separate categories Moreover systems theory allows us to explain not only how those transcodings are specific to particular systemshow art and architecture for ex ample integrate electronic technologies as artbut also how in being system specific they are paradoxically paradigmatic of and produce the very situation those systems attempt to respond to24 That situa tion of course is hypercomplexity created by what Luhmann calls the functional differentiation of modern society what other criti cal vocabularies would call its specialization or more moralistically fragmentation which only gets accentuated and accelerated under postmodernity25 For Luhmann the social system of artlike any other autopoietic system by definitionfinds itself in an environment that is always al ready more complex than itself and all systems as we know from our earlier discussions attempt to adapt to this complexity by filtering it in terms of their own selfreferential codes which are based on a funda mental distinction by means of which they carry out their operations The point of the system is to reproduce itself but no system can deal with everything or even many things all at oncehence the need for a code of selectivity As I noted in my earlier discussions of Luhmanns work two subsidiary points need to be accented here First responding to environmental complexity in terms of their own selfreferential codes is how subsystems build up their own internal complexity one might think here of the various subspecialties of the legal system say or the specialization of disciplines in the education system as I argued earlier in my discussion of disciplinarity in doing so systems become more finely grained in their selectivity and thus they buy time in relation to overwhelming environmental complexity and change As Luhmann puts it The systems inferiority in complexity compared to that of the environment must be counterbalanced by strategies of selection26 But if the selfreference of the systems code reduces the flow of envi ronmental complexity into the system it also increases its irritability and in a real sense its dependence on the environment As for this latter point it is worth noting again the complex and seemingly paradoxical fact that the autopoietic closure of a system whether social or biologicalis precisely what connects it to its envi ronment As Luhmann explains it The concept of a selfreferentially closed system does not contradict the systems openness to the environ ment Instead in the selfreferential mode of operation closure is a form of broadening possible environmental contacts closure increases by constituting elements more capable of being determined the complex ity of the environment that is possible for the system 37 This is why as Luhmann puts it in Art as a Social System autopoiesis and complexity are conceptual coordinates    Assuming that the systems autopoiesis is at work evolutionary thresholds can catapult the system to a level of higher complexityin the evolution of living organisms toward sexual reproduction independent mobility a central nervous system To an external observer this may resemble an increase in system differentiation or look like a higher degree of in dependence from environmental conditions Typically such evolutionary jumps simultaneously increase a systems sensitivity and irritability it is more easily disturbed by environmental conditions that for their part result from an increase in the systems own complexity Dependency lose the building and independence in a simple causal sense are therefore not invariant magnitudes in that more of one would imply less of the other Rather they vary according to a systems given level of complexity In systems that are successful in evolutionary terms more independence typically amounts to a greater dependency on the environment    But all of this can happen only on the basis of the systems operative closure27 The informationfilter metaphor invoked above is misleading however precisely for the reasons noted at the beginning of the chapter because systems interface with their environment in terms of and only in terms of their own constitutive distinctions and the selfreferential codes based on them the environment is not an ontological category but a functional one it is not an outside to the system that is given as such from which the system then differentiates itselfit is not in other words either nature or society in the traditional sensebut is rather always the outside of a specific inside All of this leads to a paradoxical situation that is central to Luhmanns work and central to understand ing Luhmanns reworking of problems inherited from both Hegel and Husserl what links the system to the worldwhat literally makes the world available to the systemis also what hides the world from the system what makes it unavailable Given my discussion of the sublime and the problem of representing the unrepresentable this should ring a bellbut a different bell as it turns out and this is a point I will exam ine in further detail in the next two chapters To understand just how different we need to remember a point emphasized from the beginning of this book that all systems carry out their operations and maintain their autopoiesis by deploying a constitutive distinction and a code based on it that in principle could be otherwise This means that there is a paradoxical identity between the two sides of the systems constitu tive distinction because the distinction between both sides is a product of only one side In the legal system for example the distinction be tween the two sides legalillegal is instantiated or reentered to use Luhmanns terminology on only one side of the distinction namely the legal But no system can acknowledge this paradoxical identity of differencewhich is also in another sense simply the contingencyof its own constitutive distinction and at the same time use that distinc tion to carry out its operations It must remain blind to the very para dox of the distinction that links it to its environment As we know from our earlier discussions that does not mean that this blind spot cannot be observed from the vantage of another systemit can and that is what we are doing right nowbut that secondorder observation will itself be based on its own blind spot thus formally reproducing a blindness that is formally the same but con tingently not the same as that of the firstorder system And here as I have suggested elsewhere we find Luhmanns fruitful reworking of the Hegelian problematic not the identity of identity and nonidentity as in Hegel but rather the nonidentity of identity and nonidentityand a productive nonidentity at that28 As Luhmann explains it in a passage I have cited more than once in these pages The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the connection with the reality of the external world is established by the blind spot of the cognitive operation Reality is what one does not perceive when one perceives it29 Or as he puts it in somewhat different terms the world is now conceived along the lines of a Husserlian metaphor as an unreachable horizon that retreats further with each operation without ever holding out the prospect of an outside30 The question thenand this is directly related to the problems raised by the topos of the sublimeis how to observe how the world observes itself how a marked space emerges via a constitutive dis tinction from the unmarked space how something becomes invisible when something else becomes visible Here we might seem far afield from addressing the Blur project but in fact Luhmann argues the generality of these questions allows one to determine more precisely what art can contribute to solving this paradox of the invisibilization that accompanies making something visible 91 In this way the prob lems that the discourse of the sublime attempts to address can be as similated to the more formally rigorous scheme of the difference be tween first and secondorder observation Any observation renders the world invisible in relation to its constitutive distinction and that invisibility must itself remain invisible to the observation that employs that distinctionwhich in turn can only be disclosed by another obser vation that will also necessarily be doubly blind in the same way 91 In this twofold sense Luhmann writes the notion of a final unityof an ultimate reality that cannot assume a form because it has no other sideis displaced into the unobservable    If the concept of the world lose the building is retained to indicate reality in its entirety then it is that whichto a secondorder observerremains invisible in the movements of obser vation his own and those of others 91 see also 29 This means not only that art can no longer be understood as an imitation of something that presumably exists along with and outside of art but more impor tantly for our purposes to the extent that imitation is still possible it now imitates the worlds invisibility a nature that can no longer be apprehended as a whole 92 The paradox unique to art which art creates and resolves Luhmann writes resides in the observability of the unobservable 149 And this is a question of form It is in these termsto return now to Diller  Scofidiothat we might best understand the uncanny effect of Blurs manufactured cloud hovering over a lake with the point being not that the cloud is not a cloud but rather that the lake is not a lake precisely in the sense that art can be said to imitate nature only because nature isnt nature an insight that is surely at work as well in Diller  Scofidios Slow House projectwhich is simply another way of saying that all ob servations including those of nature are contingent and of necessity blind to their own contingency To put it in a Deleuzian rather than Luhmannian register we might say that Blur virtualizes the very na ture it imitates but only paradoxically by concretizing that virtualiza tion in its formal decisionsan imitation of nature that formally ren ders the impossibility of an imitation of nature As Luhmann puts it in an analysis that is thematized as it were in the blurriness of Diller  Scofidios project and in the critical intent they attach to it Art makes visible possibilities of order that would otherwise remain invis ible It alters conditions of visibilityinvisibility in the world by keeping invisibility constant and making visibility subject to variation 96 And here I think we can bring into the sharpest possible focus if the metaphor can be allowed in this context the brilliance of the projects refusal of architecture and its strategy of focusing on the radicality of an absent building In this context one might say that the strength of Blurs formal intervention visàvis the medium of architecture is precisely its formlessness because it is calculated to bring into focus how the realm officially known as architecture to borrow Koolhaas and Maus phrase can no longer keep invisibility constant and make visibility subject to variation Official architecture invisibilizes the invisibility of the world precisely by being too visible too legible And in so doing as art it might as well be invisible Here we might recall Luhmanns suggestive comments about Christos wrapping of architectural structures In an earlier moment of the postmodern in architecture quotation of historical styles elements and the like attempts as Luhmann puts it in Art as a Social System to copy a differentiated and diverse environment into the artwork but this in turn only raises the further formal problem of whether and in what way the work can claim unity and whether it can assert itself against its own  requisite variety 29899 How Luhmann asks can the art system reflect upon its own differentiation not only in the form of theory but also in individual works of art Christos response to this problem he suggests is particularly striking if objects can no longer legitimize their boundaries and distinctions they must be wrapped 400n220 From this perspective we might think of Blur as Christo and JeanneClaude Wrapped Reichstag Berlin 197195 Photograph by Wolfgang Volz Copyright 1995 Christo lose the building a wrapped building with no building inside Or better yet as a wrapped building in which even the wrapping has too much form and begins to obsolesce the minute that form is concretized But what can it mean to say that an architectural project is con cerned primarily with having little enough form Hereand once again the otherwise daunting abstraction of systems theory is indispensable we need to understand that in no sense are we talking about objects sub stances materials or things when we use the term form Nor are we even for that matter talking about shape when we talk about form in Luhmanns sense The word formal here does not refer to the distinction which at first guided modern art between form and matter or form and content but to the characteristics of an indicating operation that observes as if from the corner of its eye what happens on the other side of form In this way the work of art points the observer toward an observation of form    It consists in demonstrating the compelling forces of order in the realm of the possible Arbitrariness is displaced beyond the boundaries of art into the unmarked space If    one transgresses this boundary and steps from the unmarked into the marked space things no longer happen randomly 148 In this way form stages the question of whether an observer can ob serve at all except with reference to an order 148 which is to say that it stages the inescapability of the fact that the world emerges only through observations employing distinctions and it stages the production of the unobservable the blind spot of observation that accompanies such observations 149 As Luhmann puts it rather un expectedly The world displays all the qualities that Nicholas of Cusa ascribed to God it is neither small nor large neither unity nor diver sity it neither has a beginning nor is it without beginningand this is why the world needs forms 15 From this vantage we can say then that the function of art is to make the world appear within the worldwith an eye toward the ambiva lent situation that every time something is made available for obser vation something else withdraws that in other words the activity of distinguishing and indicating that goes on in the world conceals the world    Yet a work of art is capable of symbolizing the reentry of the world into the world because it appearsjust like the worldincapable of emenda tion 149 italics mine With regard to this reentry two related points should be highlighted here to fully appreciate the specificity of Blurs formal innovations Firstand I have already touched on this in my discussion of Tree Cityform is in a profound sense a temporal problem if for no other reason than because of the contingency of any constitutive distinc tion Second formal decisions operate on two levels what we might call the internal and external they operate that is in relating the for mal decisions of the artwork itself to the larger system of art but also in relating the artwork as a whole to its larger environment of which the subsystem of art is only a part What is at stake operatively speaking in the production and observa tion of a work of art is always a temporal unity that is either no longer or not yet observed In this sense the artwork is the result of intrinsic form decisions and at the same time the metaform determined by these decisions which by virtue of its inner forms can be distinguished from the unmarked space of everything elsethe work as fully elabo rated object 72 Even more forcefully one might say that here we are dealing not with objects at all but rather with what systems theory sometimes calls eigenvalues or eigenbehaviors recursive distinctions that unfold and can only unfoldover time even as they can only be experienced in the fleeting moment of the present31 From this vantage objects appear as repeated indications which rather than having a specific opposite are demarcated against everything else In fact Luhmann suggests that we might follow Mead and Whitehead who assigned a function to identifiable and recognizable objects whose primary pur pose is to bind time This function is needed because the reality of experience and actions consists in mere event sequences that is in an ongoing selfdissolution32 These terms are remarkably apt for understanding how Blurs significance as a work of art under conditions of postmodernity goes far beyond the mere thematizations we can readily articulate which Diller  Scofidio themselves clearly reject Indeed in its unstable form shifting constantly in both shape and density of light and moisture lose the building this building that is not a building could well be described as epitomiz ing a temporal unity that is either no longer or not yet observed a something that is also to use Diller  Scofidios words a nothing In short a blur At the same time paradoxically as a metaform one could hardly imagine a more daring and original formal decision that dramatically distinguishes itself from the unmarked space of every thing else When we combine this understanding of the artwork as what Luhmann calls a quasiobject with attention to the double as pect of its formal decisions outlined earlier we can zero in on the fact that paradoxically the shapelessness of the Blur building is precisely what constitutes its most decisive and binding formal qualityand not least of course with regard to adjacent formal decisions in the realm of architecture Its refusal of architecture and its demateriali zation of the architectural medium paradoxically epitomize the ques tion of architectural form from a Luhmannian perspective that is the shapeshifting loosely defined space of Blur only dramatizes what is true of all architectural forms As the shifting winds over the Lake of Neuchâtel blow the cloud this way and that the joke is not on Blur but rather on any architectural forms that think they are solid real objectsthat have one might say a compositional rather than sys tematic understanding of the medium In this light one is tempted to read those moments when the winds swept nearly all the cloud away to reveal the underlying tensegrity structureleaving as one reviewer put it the view of an unfinished building awaiting its skin33as the most instructive all insofar as the building official architecture is revealed to be precisely not the building As we have already noted the effectiveness of these formal deci sions is only enhanced by the fact that they are smuggled inside the Trojan horse of the works savvy play with the art imitates nature theme From a systems theory point of view we might say that the joke here is not on those who think that art imitates nature but on those who think it doesntnot in the sense of an imitation of some thing that presumably exists along with and outside of art but in the sense that it now imitates the worlds invisibility a nature that can no longer be apprehended as a whole34 Another name for this fact as we have already noted is contingencynamely the contingency of the distinctions and indications that make the world available and because they are contingent simultaneously make it unavailable It is against that contingency that the artwork and its formal decisions assert them selves Luhmann writes All forms especially forms of art must per sist against the challenge that they could be different They convince by evoking alternative possibilities while neutralizing any preference for forms not chosen 92 The genius of Blur from this vantage is that it submits itself to this contingency in the vagaries and malleability of its shape its loose binding of time to recall Whitehead and Meads definition of objects while simultaneously taking it into account but as it were preemptively within its own frame as an indicating op eration that observes as if from the corner of its eye what happens on the other side of form 148 In doing so it employs constraints for the sake of increasing the works freedom in disposing over other constraints and this includes those contingencies that rather than threatening the work with obsolescence now increase the resonance of the work with its environment with all that it is not since those contingencies are now seen to be always already anticipated by the works noncontingent formal decision itself Of course all of this raises the question of what exactly is art if the formlessness of the object is being equated with the strength of its formal statement if the strongest form of something turns out to be nothing Here however we need only remind ourselves that questions of form are not questions of objects indeed if we fol low Whitehead Mead and systems theory even objects are not ques tions of objects And if thats the case then perhaps we are better off rephrasing the question along the following lines What is the rela tionship between discourse about art and the art object itself  On this point we would do well Luhmann rightly suggests to remember the lessons of Duchamp Cage and conceptual art in general35 One can ask how an art object distinguishes itself from other natural or artifi cial objects for example from a urinal or a snow shovel Luhmann writes Marcel Duchamp used the form of a work of art to impress this question on his audience and in a laudable effort eliminated all sensu ously recognizable differences between the two But can a work of art at once pose and answer this question36 The answer as it turns out is no because the meaning of Duchamps snow shovelthe significance of its firstorder formal decisionsdepends on and anticipates and lose the building manipulates a secondorder discourse of art criticism and theory in terms of which those firstorder decisions are received The firstorder observer need only identify a work of art as an object in contradistinc tion to all other objects or processes But for those who experience the work and want to understand its significance the situation is quite different Here the project of Cage and Duchamp is to confront the observer with the question of how he goes about identifying a work of art as a work of art The only possible answer is by observing observa tions 71 The observer uses a distinction to indicate what he observes This hap pens when it happens But if one wants to observe whether and how this happens employing a distinction is not enoughone must also indicate the distinction The concept of form serves this purpose    Whoever observes forms observes other observers in the rigorous sense that he is not interested in the materiality expectations or ut terances of these observers but strictly and exclusively in their use of distinctions 6667 Luhmann argues in fact that art and art criticism have been struggling with this issue at least since the early modern period In the convention of the still life for example which assumes great impor tance in Italian and Dutch painting we are presented with unworthy objects that could acquire meaning only by presenting the art of pre sentation itself focusing our attention on the blatant discrepancy between the banality of the subject matter and its artful presentation 69a process that is only further distilled in Duchamps snow shovel Indeed part of the genius of Duchamps work is that it reveals how the formula of disinterested pleasure fails to clarify what can be meant by artful presentation as an end in itself which only begs the ques tion that there is perhaps a special interest in being disinterested and can we assume that such an interest also motivates the artist who pro duces the work and who can neither preclude nor deny an interest in the interests of others 69 For Luhmann such questions index the situation of art as a social system under functionally differentiated mo dernity of art struggling to come to terms with its raison dêtrein systems theory terms to achieve and justify its operational closure or autonomy To create a work of art under these sociohistorical con ditions then amounts to creating specific forms for an observation of observations This is the sole purpose for which the work is pro duced From this perspective the artwork accomplishes the structural coupling between first and secondorder observations in the realm of art    The artist accomplishes this by clarifyingvia his own obser vations of the emerging workhow he and others will observe the work 69 Such an understanding is well and good but it would seem to leave wholly to the side the question of the experience of art as a percep tual and phenomenological eventsomething that would appear to be rather spectacularly foregrounded in Blur as Mark Hansen has recently argued and foregrounded moreover quite selfconsciously in terms of the function of spectacle in the tradition of the international expo as a genre a matter emphasized in Dillers lectures about the project at Princeton and elsewhere37 Indeed one might well argue that this and not the coupling of first and secondorder observations by means of form is what motivates contemporary art its experimentation with different media and so ona rule that is only proved so the argument would unfold by the exception of conceptual art Yet here we find one of the more original and innovative aspects of Luhmanns theory of art as a social system Luhmanns point is not to deny the phenomenologi cal aspect of the artwork but to point outwhich seems rather obvious upon reflectionthat the meaning of the artwork cannot be referenced to much less reduced to this material and perceptual aspect Rather the work of art copresents perception and communicationand does so in a way that turns out to be decisive for what another theoretical vocabulary might call arts critical function in relation to society To understand how this happens we need to revisit one of the central points of the opening chapter that for Luhmann perception and beyond that consciousness and communication operate in mutu ally exclusive operationally closed autopoietic systems though they are structurally coupled through media such as language As Luhmann puts it in a formulation surely calculated to provoke Humans can not communicate not even their brains can communicate not even their conscious minds can communicate Only communication can communicate38 Communication operates with an unspecific refer ence to the participating state of mind he continues it is especially lose the building unspecific as to perception It cannot copy states of mind cannot imitate them cannot represent them39 At the same time however consciousness and perception are a medium for communication On the one hand unperceived communications do not exist if they did how would we know communication Luhmann writes can hardly come into being without the participation of the mind and in this sense the relationship is asymmetrical 374 On the other hand communication uses the mind as a medium precisely because com munication does not thematize the mind in question Metaphorically speaking the mind in question remains invisible to communication 378 The mind is of necessity its own operationally closed biological system but because it is also a necessary medium for communication we can say that the mind has the privileged position of being able to disturb stimulate and irritate communication 379 It cannot in struct or direct communicationsreports of perceptions are not per ceptions themselvesbut it can stimulate communication without ever becoming communication 37980 For several reasons the irreducibility of perception to commu nication and vice versa and their asymmetrical relationship is crucial to what a different theoretical vocabulary would call arts critical function First as Dietrich Schwanitz munication to put it in Derridean terms differs defers and temporal izes In the work of art the difference between perception and commu nication is reentered in the services of the works communication But because of this asymmetry in speeds it is reentered in a way that calls attention to the contingency of communicationnot of the firstorder communication of the artwork which appears incapable of emenda tion it is what it is but of the secondorder observation of the works meaning and its critical function visàvis the system of art This can be accomplished as in Blur by making perception outrun communica tion as it were a process well described by Hansen the better to pro voke a question that the work itself is made to answer Or conversely in a work like On Kawaras Date Paintings it can be accomplished by using the deficit of perceptual depth or complexity in the paintings themselves to call attention to the difference between the works im mediate perceptual surface and its larger meaning41 Thus the artwork copresents the difference between perception and communication and this difference is what allows art to have something like a privileged relationship to what is commonly invoked as the ineffable or the incommunicable and it uses perception to irritate and stimulate communication to respond to the question what does this perceptual event mean As Luhmann puts it in a key passage for understanding his theory of art The function of art would then consist in integrating what is in prin ciple incommunicablenamely perceptioninto the communication network of society    The art system concedes to the perceiving con sciousness its own unique adventure in observing artworksand yet makes available as communication the formal selection that triggered the adventure Unlike verbal communication which all too quickly moves toward a yesno bifurcation communication guided by percep tion relaxes the structural coupling of consciousness and communica tion without destroying it of course    In a manner that is matched neither by thought nor by communication perception presents aston ishment and recognition in a single instant Art uses enhances and in a sense exploits the possibilities of perception in such a way that it can present the unity of this distinction    The pleasure of astonishment already described in antiquity refers to the unity of the difference be tween astonishment and recognition to the paradox that both intensify one another42 lose the building And Luhmann addsin an observation directly relevant to Blurs auda cious formal solution to the problem of architectureExtravagant forms play an increasingly important role in this process 141 This is not however simply a matter of pleasure or aesthesis In fact it is what gives art something like a privileged critical rela tionship to society because art establishes a reality of its own that differs from ordinary reality Despite the works perceptibility de spite its undeniable reality Luhmann writes it simultaneously con stitutes another reality    Art splits the world into a real world and an imaginary world and the function of art concerns the meaning of this split 142 By virtue of its unique relationship to the difference between perception and communication art can raise this question in an especially powerful way not available to other social systems If we think of objects themselves as eigenbehaviors to seize once again on Heinz von Foersters term as stabilizations of various durations made possible by the repeated recursive application of particular dis tinctions then we might observe that the objects that emerge from the recursive selfapplication of communicationversus say rocks or treescontribute more than any other kinds of norms and sanctions to supplying the social system with necessary redundancies they literally fix social space This is probably even more true Luhmann observes of such quasiobjects to use Michel Serress phrase that have been invented for the sake of this specific function such as kings or soccer balls Such quasiobjects can be comprehended only in rela tion to this functionindeed it is their sole reason for being Works of art Luhmann continues are quasiobjects in this sense They individualize themselves by ex cluding the sum total of everything else not because they are con strued as given but because their significance as objects implies a realm of social regulation One must scrutinize works of art as intensely and with as close attention to the object as one does when watching kings and soccer balls in this wayand in the more complex case where one observes other observers by focusing on the same objectthe socially regulative reveals itself 47 When we remember that for Luhmann this more complex case is represented nowhere more clearly than in our experience of the mass media the relationship between Blurs formal decisions as a work of art and its critical agenda of shedding light on the socially regulativeon the terrain of an international media expo no lesscomes even more forcefully into view In these terms works of art in calling our atten tion to the realm of the socially regulative cast light on precisely those contingencies constructions and norms that the mass media in their own specific mode of communication occlude In the first in stance the artwork we seem to be dealing with completely ad hoc constructed objects whose realm of reference is not the real world at all but that of the imagination In the second we appear to be dealing with the opposite in which the representations of the mass media are motivated by the objects and facts of the real world In fact however this thematization in terms of imaginative and real only obscures the need to rearticulate the relationship in terms of the dynamics of first and secondorder observation of different social systems As Luhmann points out the mass media create the illusion that we are firstorder observers whereas in fact this is already secondorder ob serving43 or more baldly still put in Kantian terms the mass media generate a transcendental illusion44 The mass medias rendering of reality howeverand this is a point that the postethical character of Diller  Scofidios work insists on in a highly specific wayis not to be taken as most people would be inclined to think as a distortion of reality It is a construction of reality For from the point of view of a postontological theory of observing systems there is no distinct real ity out there who then would make these distinctions    There is no transcendental subject We have to rely on the system of the mass media that construct our reality    If there is no choice in accepting these observations because there is no equally powerful alternative available we have at least the possibility to deconstruct the presenta tions of the mass media their presentations of the present45 That deconstruction of the mass media in Blur proceeds by means of the artworks secondorder observation of the firstorder system of the mass media but that observation in turn only happens by art doing what it does as its own firstorder system with its own code its own blind spot That formal symmetry between the two observ ing systems howeverthe fact that the dynamics of communica tion in autopoietic social systems operate in the same ways in each lose the building system on the basis of paradoxical selfreference constitutive blindness to the unity of the systems core distinction and so ononly throws into critical relief the difference in the relationship of communication and perception and in the case at hand specifically visual perception that is specific to each system And Blur will put that difference to critical use under the thematization of spectacle We can gain a sharper sense of just how this is the case when we recall that for Luhmann electronic mass media are just the latest in a series of powerful developments in the history of what he calls media of dissemination beginning with lan guage and then crucially the invention of writing and printing whose power lies in their ability to make communication independent from a specific perceptual substrate or set of coordinates Alphabetized writ ing made it possible to carry communication beyond the temporally and spatially limited circle of those who were present at any particular time he writes and language per seand even more so writing and printingincreases the understandability of communication beyond the sphere of perception46 Unlike oral speech which can compensate for lack of information with persuasion and can synchronize speaking hearing and accepting in a rhythmic and rhapsodic way leaving literally no time for doubt 162 writing and printing enforce an experience of the difference that constitutes communicationnamely the difference between communication and perceptionand they are in this precise sense more communicative forms of communication 163 For Luhmann the electronic mass media represent the culmina tion of this general line of historical development Indeed for the differ entiation of a system of the mass media the decisive achievement can be said to have been the invention of technologies of dissemination which not only circumvent interaction among those copresent but effectively render such interaction impossible for the mass medias own commu nications47 This process began with the advent of the printing press when the volume of written material multiplied to the extent that oral interaction among all participants in communication is effectively and visibly rendered impossible 16 And so it is Luhmann argues that in the wake of the socalled democratization of politics and its depen dence on the media of public opinion    those participating in politics politicians and voters alikeobserve one another in the mirror of pub lic opinion    The level of firstorder observation is guaranteed by the continuous reports of the mass media    Secondorder observation occurs via the inferences one can draw about oneself or others if one assumes that those who wish to participate politically encounter one another in the mirror of public opinion and that this is sufficient48 It is just this situation that Blur attempts to address if we believe Diller  Scofidionamely by subjecting communication in its mass mediated mode as something immediately legible and consumable to a perceptual blur so that spectacle operates here not in the service of imme diately meaningful prefab ideological content as in the electronic mass media but rather as the unavoidable provocation to another communica tion whose meaning is far from immediately clear and in being so oper ates directly in the services of arts own communication and autopoiesis ie what does this mean is this art In this way Diller  Scofidios project might be understood as bringing into focus 1 how the contin gency of communication is managed and manipulated by the socially regulative in the electronic mass media and 2 how that dynamic in turn is coupled to a certain consumerist schematization of visuality in which the difference between perception and communication is always already reentered in massmediated communication to produce a pre digested iconographic visual space readily incorporated by a subject whose unethical relation to the visual might best be summed up as click here We might say then that Blur uses the difference between perception and communication in a way diametrically opposed to what we find in the electronic mass media and then routes that difference be tween art and the mass media through the works formal choices to ren der them specifically meaningful as art not just as wellmeaning critical platitude What is remarkable here of course is not that Blur makes this somewhat unremarkable observation about the relationship of percep tion and communication in electronic mass media a relationship par ticularly evident in the realm of visuality What is remarkable is that Blur does so without saying so by insisting only on itself This is simply to say that Blur communicates this difference as art And if it didnt we wouldnt pay any attention to it Emersons Romanticism Cavells Skepticism Luhmanns Modernity If Emersons representativeness his universalizing is not to go unexamined neither should his habitually condemned individualism If he is to be taken as an instance of human ism    then he is at the same time to be taken as some form of antihumanist working against ourselves against what we understand as human understanding stanley cavell Emersons Constitutional Amending Reading Fate Reality is what one does not perceive when one perceives it niklas luhmann The Cognitive Program of Constructivism and a Reality That Remains Unknown As a mode of cultural practice Emersons romanticism has often been taken as an especially outlandishthat is to say an espe cially incoherentengagement of the central themes associated with the romantic problematic the sublime imagination etc that we have been attempting so far to rescript in these pages the better to disclose their essential rigor and systematicity a rigor and systematicity that is achieved because of not in spite of the unwillingness to turn away from the paradoxical forms of observation and selfreference that sys tems theory but also in its way deconstruction enables us to theorize with some depth and precision This charge arises against Emerson be cause of the insistent strangeness the unremittingly heretical quality of his writing in which a signature feature is to take precisely the turn of thought or phrase that seems to undermine at a stroke the entire argu ment just made a seemingly relentless drive to pursue thought wherever it may lead even into paradox and conceptual meltdown As Emersons writes in SelfReliance in an altogether characteristic gesture Speak emer sons romanticism what you think now in hard words and tomorrow speak what to morrow thinks in hard words again though it contradict every thing you said today1 As the philosopher Stanley Cavell has noted Along with the gesture of denying philosophy to Emerson goes another al most as common    namely that of describing Emersons prose as a kind of mist or fog as if it is generally quite palpable what it is that Emerson is obscurely reaching for words to say and generally quite pat ent that the ones he finds are more or less arbitrary and conventional    as though he cannot mean anew in every word he says2 For Cavell the power of the Emersonian project begins with the rigor of its confrontation with the inescapability and consequences of philosophical skepticism the fact as Cavell puts it that the world ex ists as it were for its own reasons3 Emerson both acknowledges bears or suffers will be a better term eventuallyand resists what Cavell calls the most famous settlement with the problem of skepti cism in the philosophical tradition namely Kants in The Critique of Pure Reason As Cavell summarizes it The dissatisfaction with such a settlement as Kants is relatively easy to state To settle with skepticism    to assure us that we do know the existence of the world or rather that what we understand as knowl edge is of the world the price Kant asks us to pay is to cede any claim to know the thing in itself to grant that human knowledge is not of things as they are in themselves You dontdo youhave to be a romantic to feel sometimes about that settlement Thanks for nothing4 The irony of the Kantian settlement with skepticismand it is an irony that will in no small part structure what Cavell characterizes as noth ing less than Emersons reinvention of philosophyis that if reason proves its power to itself over itself by discovering the difference between the mere appearances of which it can have knowledge and the Ding an sich of which it cannot5 then the triumph of philosophy is also at the same time its failure a final failure as it turns out because knowledge secures itself only by losing the world leaving us locked to borrow Emersons phrase in Experience in a prison of glass6 As Emerson puts it in a famous passage from Experience that Cavell returns to time and again I take this evanescence and lubricity of all objects which lets them slip through our fingers then when we clutch hardest to be the most unhandsome part of our condition 200 emer sons romanticism What this demands from philosophy then is a double gesture in the recognition that thinking must henceforward proceed differently First Emerson comes to understandas Cavell brilliantly and even movingly demonstratesthat philosophy has to do with the per plexed capacity to mourn the passing of the world7 In Experience that mourning is figured in some of the most shocking and vertiginous lines in all of American literature where reflecting on the grief attend ing the death of his son two years earlier Emerson writes I cannot get it nearer to me it does not touch me Emerson grieves Cavell suggests not so much over the death of his son but over the loss of the world with which even the experience of grief cannot bring him into closer contact I grieve that grief can teach me nothing Grief too Emerson writes will make us idealists8 Second if the demand for foundational concepts abstract synthesis and unity of judgments only drives the world away from us in the very act of trying to grasp and apprehend it then thinking must be reconceived as what Cavell calls clutchings opposite9 Philosophy to put it telegraphically must get out of hand which is exactly what happens in Emersons reinvention of philosophy as antiphilosophyhence the demanding wildness of Emersons writing which will lead the attentive reader to ask more than once Is he serious Emerson thus inaugurates a rethinking of thinking that will even tually lead as Cavell points out to Heideggers assertion that thinking is a handicraft but a handicraft carried out in respect of the deriva tion of the word thinking from a root for thanking    as giving thanks for the gift of thinking10 And eventuallyas Cavell does not point outit will lead not only to Derridas analysis of the gift but also to his critique of Heideggers humanism in relation to the question of spe cies difference in the essay Geschlecht II Heideggers Hand11 There Derrida deconstructs the purity of the distinction between giving and taking that Heideggers humanism takes we might even say holds for granteda deconstruction that one might well argue is writ large in Emersons essay Fate where he insists See how fate slides into free dom and freedom into fate observe how far the roots of every creature run or find if you can a point where there is no thread of connection 273 Thinking with Emerson then becomes not active apprehension prehensile grasping of the world by our concepts as it were but an emer sons romanticism act of reception a reception in which passivitybecause it consists of a capacity to be affected by the world in manifold ways that cannot be contained by the choked bottleneck of thought as philosophy has tradi tionally conceived itbecomes paradoxically a maximally active pas sivity This process is everywhere testified to in Emersons work from beginning to end from the Transparent Eyeball passage in Nature to the seemingly paradoxical assertion in SelfReliance that self reliance is Godreliance to his assertion in Experience that all I know is reception I am and I have but I do not get and when I fancied I had gotten anything I found I did not    When I receive a new gift I do not macerate my body to make the account square for if I should die I could not make the account square The benefit overran the merit the first day 212 But as crucial as Cavells work has been for enabling a new and deeply compelling understanding of Emerson and his relationship to Continental philosophy I want to suggest that a more rigorous and historically compelling understanding of Emersons work is available to us if we reframe Cavells account itself within a more comprehen sive view of Emersons romanticism as a response to the condition of modernity and its epistemological and ethical fallouta phenomenon marked in Cavells reading by the broad brushstroke of skepticism In this connection it is surprising as Paul Jay has pointed out that Emersons work as a response specifically to modernity has not re ceived more attention as debates have instead been preoccupied with arguments in the 1980s and 1990s over whether Emerson is best under stood as a transcendentalist or a pragmatist or more recently with the political status of Emersons workbut political understood it turns out in a quite ideologically specific way12 And even in more re cent studies where the context of modernity does seem to be cultivated for understanding Emersons work for example in Jay Grossmans Reconstituting the American Renaissance which revisits Emerson in the context of a specifically American version of the long eighteenth century the conjugation remains hampered by a certain American exceptionalismone replete with a familiar set of assumptions about what politics is how it is related to questions of ethics and agency how individuals are related to social institutions and so onthat has been endemic to American studies and its core theoretical and methodologi emer sons romanticism cal commitments as numerous commentators have noted almost since the inception of the discipline itself13 Those assumptions and commitments I would argue are consti tuted by and reproduce an ideologically specific form of liberal human ism But as one of its critics Donald Pease has recently pointed out What Emerson referred to as my genius when it calls me achieved effects that were independent of the processes of identification inter pellation and internalization associated with liberal institutions and it thus also undermined liberalisms conception of the possessive indi vidual as its subject14 To put it bluntly the liberal humanist assump tions taken for granted in most American studies critiques of Emerson are not just tangentially but directly under assault in Emersons work So it should come as no surprise that we often find the assumption in American studies work on Emerson that to abandon those very ideas about politics agency and so on is to be more or less by default politi cally conservative or regressive which is after all the way ideology works through institutions like academia to reproduce itself  Though I cannot pursue the argument in any detail here I would suggest particularly in the current geopolitical moment which can only be called a moment of crisis for liberal democracy and its ideology and institutionsthat we would be better off taking seriously Emersons interrogation of liberalisms assumptions about subjectivity agency and politics even if those queries end as they often do in Emerson in anything but a sanguine view of our situation We should take heed of them for the same reasons that have generated such an upsurge in interest in figures such as Giorgio Agamben and Carl Schmitt Indeed what Chantal Mouffe writes about Schmitt could well serve as a para phrase of Cavells reading of Emersons late essay Fate and its im plications for politics As Mouffe puts it The political cannot be re stricted to a certain type of institution or envisioned as constituting a specific sphere or level of society It must be conceived as a dimension that is inherent to every human society and that determines our very ontological condition15 We may now return with a somewhat different set of coordi nates and a different sense of their implications to the question of mo dernity whose chief philosophical challenge as Jay points out is the wellknown process of secularization It is this challenge to which emer sons romanticism romanticism so the story goes constitutes a finally flawed and even fanciful response one whose contours we have already glimpsed in the fundamentally ironic structure of the Kantian transcendentalism and its settlement with skepticism For Habermas in The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity secularization means that thought can and will no longer borrow the criteria by which it takes its orientation from models supplied by another epoch it has to create its normativity out of itself for Foucaultand here we return to Kant once moreit is that thought must put its own reason to use without subjecting it self to any authority16 If the upside of the philosophical situation of modernity is as Jay puts it that the present represents an exit or a way out of subordination to traditional emer sons romanticism representationalist mode of philosophical practice As Rorty explains it the problem with philosophical representationalism is the assumption that making true and representing are reciprocal relations as if the nonlinguistic item which makes S true is the one represented by S18 For philosophical idealism that item will be something in the changeless character of the subject for realism it will be something in the nature of the object that has a context of its own a context which is privileged by virtue of being the objects rather than the inquir ers 96 In either case what representationalism fails to see is that determinacy is not what is in questionthat neither does thought determine reality nor in the sense intended by the realist does real ity determine thought 5 Both positions as Cavell might say find themselves unduly even preeningly handsomehence the strange insistent movement of Emersons prose which takes for granted as it were Rortys contention that words take their meaning from other words rather than by virtue of their representative character and their transparency to the real19 that grasping the thing itself is not something that precedes contextualization20 For these reasons as Rorty has lucidly explained leveling the charge of relativism at antirepresentationalism is an empty gesture Relativism certainly is selfrefuting he writes but there is a differ ence between saying that every community is as good as every other and saying that we have to work out from the networks where we are The idea he continues that every tradition or belief or idea or community is as rational or as moral as every other could be held only by a god    Such a being would have escaped from history and conver sation into contemplation and metanarrative To accuse postmodern ism of relativism is to try to put a metanarrative in the postmodernists mouth 202 It is precisely this kind of embeddedness of course that is everywhere under intense scrutiny in essays of Emersons such as Fate And soto return now to Cavellto take the unsolvability of skepticism to heart is not just at the same stroke to abandon the rep resentationalist philosophical project it is also to change our view of the relationship of thinking and language that I have already discussed in some detail in the first half of this book What Kant confronted as merely a problem of thought Emerson grappled with under the additional rigors of writing and languageof philosophy as a writing emer sons romanticism practiceso that the stipulations or terms under which we can say anything at all to one another will themselves be subjected to endless and endlessly unfinalized scrutiny21 As Cavell puts it in Emerson I find the Critique of Pure Reason turned upon itself notions of limitation and of condition are as determining in the essay Fate as they are in Kant but it is as if these terms are themselves subjected to transcenden tal deduction as if not just twelve categories but any and every word in our language stands under the necessity of deduction or say deriva tion    Emerson is commonly felt to play fast and loose with some thing like contradiction in his writing but I am speaking of a sense in which contradiction the countering of diction is the genesis of his writing of philosophy 113 What this means is that when we come upon such apparently full bore idealist statements in Emerson as the following from the essay FateIntellect annuls fate So far as a man thinks he is freethis apparently genteel thought Cavell writes now turns out to mean that    our antagonism to fate to which we are fated and in which our freedom resides is as a struggle with the language we emit of our character with itself22 One striking example of this new philosophical practice that Cavell finds in Emersonthis time in relation not to Kant but to Descartesoccurs in SelfReliance when Emerson writes Man is timid and apologetic he is no longer upright he dares not say I think I am but quotes some saint or sage If the central feature of the Cartesian subject is as Cavell writes that the discovery that my existence requires hence permits proof you might say authen tication    requires that if I am to exist I must name my existence acknowledge it then the real rigor of Emersons confrontation with these terms is that it goes the whole way with Descartes insight It insists on the proof of selfhoodincluding its proof in and through the terms of thinkingwithout providing a fixed a priori subject on which such a proof could rely and of which it could be as it were the representationas if there were nothing to rely on Cavell writes but reliance itself23 The beauty of Emersons answer to Descartes Cavell writes emer sons romanticism lies in its weakness you may say in its emptinessindeed in two weaknesses First it does not prejudge what the I or self or mind or soul may turn out to be but only specifies a condition that whatever it is must meet Second the proof only works in the moment of its giving for what I prove is the existence only of a creature who can enact its existence as exemplified in actually giving the proof not one who at all time does in fact enact it 87 The self of Emersonian selfreliance then is not a state of being but a moment of change say of becominga transience of being a being of transience 89 In Cavelland this marks precisely his difference with Rorty the paradoxical selfreference of the proof of the Emersonian self is crucial to what we might think of as its generative incompleteness This movement of the Emersonian selfin which the self might be said to be alive only to the extent that it is movingis crucial to what Cavell sees as the political import of Emersons work what he calls its democratic or moral perfectionism As Cavell describes it I do not read Emerson as saying    that there is one unattainedattainable self we repetitively never arrive at but rather that having a self is a process of moving to and from nexts    That the self is always at tained as well as to be attained creates the problem in Emersons con cept of selfreliance    that unless you manage the reliance of the at tained on the unattainedattainable that is unless you side that way you are left in precisely the negation of the position he calls for left in conformity24 In its onwardness the Emersonian self must con stantly surpass the selves it has already become but not to attain an ideal fixed selfhood And yet since the task for each is his or her own selftransformation Cavell sensibly observes the representativeness implied in that life may seem not to establish a recognition of others in different positions so as to be disqualified as a moral position al together Emersons remarkable twist on this problem however is that his writing works out the conditions for my recognizing my differ ence from others as a function of my recognizing my difference from myself 25 after all strictly speaking only you can transform you and only I can transform me So Emersons turn is to make my partiality itselfwhat I am here calling somewhat at a tangent to Cavell as will become clear my contingencythe sign and incentive of my emer sons romanticism siding with the next or future self which means siding against my at tained perfection or conformity sidings which require the recogni tion of an otherthe acknowledgement of a relationshipin which this sign is manifest26 Emersonian perfectionism may thus be conceived as a kind of ongoing act of radical negative capability that provides the foundation though that is eventually not the word we would want of course for democratic relations with others with those other selves I have not yet been but who alsoand this is the engine of Emersons constant polemical projectneed to surpass themselves in an ongoing process of democracy conceived as otherness always yet to be achieved or if already achieved only achieved in the present by the other and not by me As difficult as it is to see Cavell is right that this idea of perfection ism is projected in contrast to the idea of ones own nature27 and all of Emersons talkand a considerable amount of talk it isof self recovery both early and late in his work directs us to not an originary fixed selfsubstance but toward a power and a process not toward the past but toward the future or rather toward futurity itself conceived as a horizon where paradoxically the only self to recover is a self that one has not yet been for the self only exists in its becoming28 Indeed from this vantage we might read recovery very differently as a recovering as burying and covering over once more the past self that casualty of what Cavell calls Emersons onwardness It is in the context and the services of these future selves and against what Emerson calls conformity that we are to understand the political involvement of the Emersonian self in the sense insisted on at the end of Experience where Emerson writes that the true ro mance which the world exists to realize will be the transformation of genius into practical power 213 As Cavell writes when Emersons critics read the line selfreliance is the aversion of conformity they take this to mean roughly that he is disgusted with society and wants no more to do with it29 But if we understand the Emersonian self as movement toward futurity and not a being then instead of conversion to a truth we already know and to a being we already are aversion means that his writing and his society incessantly recoil from or turn away from one another but since this is incessant the picture is at the same time of each incessantly turning toward the other30 This process emer sons romanticism is dramatized perhaps nowhere more forcefully than in late essays and addresses like Fate and The Fugitive Slave Law where Emerson insists time and again on turning away from society and its institu tions toward the domain of justice and ethics only to turn back to the realization of freedom not in transcendence but in practical power31 On the one hand Emerson asserts in The Fugitive Slave Law No forms neither constitutions nor laws nor covenants nor churches nor bibles are of any use in themselves The Devil nestles comfortably into them all There is no help but in the head and heart and hamstrings of a man32 On the other hand as Emerson writes in Fate A man must thank his defects and stand in some terror of his talents A tran scendent talent draws so largely on his forces as to lame him a defect pays him revenues on the other side 273 and he reminds us that his power is hooped in by a necessity which by many experiments he touches on every side until he learns its arc 268 A corollary of this aversive movement of the Emersonian self is that the worldand we already know this from the Kantian anatomy of skepticismalways al ready vanishes from me as Cavell puts it becomes a horizon that we can only approach but never reach one that in a radical sense depends on the terms we use not to apprehend it but to receive or as Cavell puts it acknowledge it just as I am impelled toward the other by my par tiality toward myself my contingency Here we can begin to get a sense of the usefulness of Niklas Luhmanns work for helping us to read the full letter of Emersons think ing First of all Luhmanns theorization of these questions is more ana lytically precise than Cavells which remains largely at the level of a philosophical thematics characterized by what one might callat least from a Luhmannian point of viewan excessive literariness That would be of less moment were it not for the fact identified by Cavell that literariness has typically been used as a kind of code for dis missing Emersons rigor and philosophical seriousness Secondand this is clearer in light of RortyCavells reading of Emerson under the master rubric of skepticism remains tied one might argue to the rep resentationalism he would otherwise seem to disown because skepti cism holds on to the desire for a representational adequation between concepts and objects even as it knows that desire to be unappeasable how else are we to understand Cavells insistence on taking seriously emer sons romanticism the mourning of the loss of the worldand not of the child Waldo as Sharon Cameron insists in her classic essay Representing Griefin Emersons Experience Third most important of all Luhmann puts acute pressure on the relentlessly paradoxical and confounding dynamics of observation that are so central and so increasingly vexing in Emersons work dynamics that are usually thematized in criticism of romanticism under the rubric of imagination and more specifically in Emersons work in his wellknown theatrics with the trope of vision as in the famous Transparent Eyeball passage in the opening pages of Nature I am nothing I see all 29 In fact if we believe Maurice Gonnaud it is Emersons movement away from such solutions to the paradoxes of observation in the early 1840s that has made his later work in lec tures and essays such as The Method of Nature and Nominalist and Realist all the more confounding for his critics After 1840 Gonnaud writes If the Romantic was dead the optimist had survived him and was ready to make a virtue of necessityspecifically I will argue in a moment a necessity called contingency33 Although he continued to call himself an idealist Gonnaud continues he had ceased to be one in Kants sense or even in Coleridges The universe gradually comes to resemble that old TwoFace creatorcreature mindmatter right wrong which he was to evoke in Nominalist and Realist 301 Emersons insistence on the contingency not transcendence of observationwhat Gonnaud calls his effort to fling out a new bridgeless ethereal less harmonious perhaps but tougherbetween the One and the Many purchased by taking it upon himself to be the champion of the acknowledged facts honored in their richness and diversity 299 led to Emerson being even less understood than he had before 1840 Remarking on The Method of Nature Gonnaud writes that his listeners confessed to understanding very little of it the word ecstasy recurs like a leitmotif applied now to Nature and now to human beings and thus compounding the confusion 301 not just for Emersons contemporaries but even for later critics such as Stephen Whicher who finds that such work incorporates two irrec oncilable perspectives and suffers from a profound incoherence 302 What I want to suggest howeverand we will need Luhmanns work to fully explain whyis that it is precisely at these moments that we emer sons romanticism find Emerson at his most rigorous systematically extrapolating in his later work the paradoxical dynamics and consequences of observation that were as both Gonnaud and Cavell rightly observe in their differ ent ways certainly central to the Emersonian corpus from the begin ning but were papered over by the more conventional idealism and romanticism we find in essays such as Nature While Gonnaud regrets in the post1840 Emerson the authors centrifugal disposition of mind which keeps him from transforming the profoundly contradictory im pulses within him into dialectical movement Luhmanns work on ob servation will help to clarify why Emersons relentless explorations of these problems cannot and should not resolve themselves into a dialec tic Here again it is not incoherence or vagueness of thought we find I would suggest but rather the genius of what we might call Emersons undoing of romanticism Of the Emerson critics I have read the one who has come closest to realizing this fact about Emersons work is Lee Rust Brown in his wonderful book The Emerson Museum As he observes about Emersons contention in Compensation that the value of the universe con trives to throw itself into every point such moments have been cited by readers who attack or applaud Emerson as a cheerful mystic who vaguely sees everything in everything34 What we have here instead Brown suggests is a more complicated process in which Coleridgean multeity in unity is subordinated to the workings of the observers where the sense found in natural objects is precisely the viewers own original means for seeing them    By virtue of these means vision rises to a place of authority over objects to a kind of perspectival re move sufficient to reveal relations within the whole scope of things 71 72 Yet such an observer is not transcendent in the usual ideal ist senseindeed in any sense Instead on display here is the more complicated dynamic of Emersonian transparencythat ability to perceive the unity of the multeitythat is the one fatal condition of moving on intellectually it is the way we pay for all worthwhile adjustments of attention It is the only way we achieve what Emerson calls new prospectsin Browns words at once the new object and the prospect of its future conversion into transparency 47 Far from being transcendent then we see one object only at the cost of an other 46 and transparency far from signifying a passive state or emer sons romanticism continuity or unity testifies to the way the eye manufactures its own discontinuous intervals 4546 At this juncture Luhmanns work can give us a more fully articu lated sense of Emersons pressure on the problem of observation It is able to do so in part because observation in Luhmann is disarticulated from vision per se and in part because systems theory takes the ad ditional step of showing how the problem of observation is related to that other central topos of romanticism invoked by Brownmulteity in unitywhich must now be rewritten in systems theorys terms as the problem of complexity and how it is handled in systemenviron ment relationships It is this convergencethe paradoxical dynamics of observation and the related problem of complexity how observa tion both reduces and produces complexitythat Emersons writing insists on more and more rigorously as his career unfolds rendering it in his mature work as literally unavoidable as in for example one of his more brazen assertions in Circles that I am a God in nature I am a weed by the wall35 Such a statementand there are many of them in Emersoninsists on the radical identity of what in the philosophical tradition are opposites namely on the one hand the absolute all constitutive subject of knowledge familiar to us from various forms of philosophical idealism the god that is secularized as imagination in romanticism and on the other hand what Kant called the patho logical contingency of the object world and the empirical Luhmann can help us to see how in such apparently outlandish and fanciful para doxes Emerson precisely registers the epistemological fallout of the very modernity to which his romanticism is respondingnot as a mystification or imaginative solution but as a kind of relentless anat omy And here we may locate another advantage of Luhmanns work over Cavells that it links these philosophical and epistemological complexities to the historical conditions of their emergence Only by taking this tack can we understand the underlying semantics and sys tematicity rather than the incoherence or fogginess of the paradox at the core of Emersons work his constant movement between assert ing on the one hand that thought dissolves the material universe and on the other that if in the least particular one could derange the order of naturewho would accept the gift of life36 Emerson insists in other words on the radical contingency and emer sons romanticism at the same time the radical authority of selfreferential observation whose positive existential valence gets figured in the whim of Self Reliance while its more vexing effects are registered in the isolation and vertigo of the opening of Experience and finally in the para doxical fatedness to freedom of The Conduct of Life Such paradoxes are from Luhmanns point of view masked in the theological tradition that Emerson inherits and famously rejects early in his career as a minis ter In fact were we to follow Luhmanns suggestion the closest thing we could find to Emersons work in the theological tradition would be not Quakerism or Unitarianism but the line of medieval theology that works its way from Saint Augustine through John Scotus Eriugena to the fifteenthcentury theologian Nicolaus Cusanus No traditional epistemology Luhmann writes could dare to go this farobviously because the position from which it would have had to deal with dis tinctness was occupied by theology37 But with the secularization of these questions in romanticisms philosophy of the subjectitself Luhmann argues a product of the unavoidable movement from hi erarchical to functionally differentiated society under modernity in which the church no longer has a centering rolethey begin to be come ever more unavoidable With the retreat of the religious world order Luhmann writes the question of how the world can observe itself becomes more pressing and vexing and it is typically answered in romanticism and its forerunner German idealist philosophy by makeshift such terms as Spirit Idea and so on38 Inspired by the idea of God as observer Luhmann writes Theology began to observe this observer even though it was forced to concede that an observer who creates and sustains the world by virtue of his observation excludes nothing and hence cannot assume an ob servable form By externalizing this paradox and by incorporating the notion of observing the unobservable into the idea of God one sought to shield the conventional notion of the world as universitas rerum from infection by logical paradoxes39 The problem with this solution of courseas Harro Muller among others has pointed outis that in an increasingly acentrically conceived society the society of modernity it is difficult to preserve the notion of an Archimedean point from which and towards which both world emer sons romanticism and society might be understood    It is also prohibited from assuming a strictly privileged extramundane observers perspective Such a per spective would place collective singulars such as God Spirit History Man Nature the subject the individual or intersubjectivity at the cen ter of a foundational discourse But these foundational discourses whether of an ontological natural or anthropological natureare predominantly a matter of selfattributions or selfsimplifications that are functionally in need of explanation40 And this is where we need Luhmann We need in other words to use Luhmanns shorthand to re place what questions with how questions41 Here the fundamental postulate of systems theoryits replacement of the familiar ontologi cal dichotomies of humanism culturenature mindbody spiritmat ter reasonfeeling and so on with the functional distinction system environmentis indispensable in allowing us to better understand how systems respond to modernitys central challenge of functional differentiation what other critical vocabularies would call its spe cialization or more moralistically or nostalgically its fragmenta tion As Muller summarizes it Perspectives are multiplied within functionally differentiated modern society without ones being able to adopt any privileged central per spective or assign a hierarchically superior leading position to any one partial system    No partial system may represent the whole and be come active in a representative manner no partial system may replace another as its functional equivalent It is precisely functional differentia tion with its internal increase in control in individual partial systems which increases disorder and risk42 As we saw in the opening chapter for Luhmann both psychic and social systems respond to this complexity by means of autopoiesis and selfreferential closure as a means of selfpreservation Such systems find themselves by definition in an environment that is always already more complex than they are and all systems attempt to adapt to this complexity by filtering it in terms of their own selfreferential codes The point of the system is to reproduce itself but no system can deal with everything or even many things all at once The legal system for example responds to changes in its environment in terms ofand emer sons romanticism only in terms ofthe distinction legalillegal In litigation decisions are not basedand it is a good thing tooon whether you are black or white male or female whether you went to school at Oxford or Cambridge and so on Two subsidiary points need to be accented here First in respond ing to environmental complexity in terms of their own selfreferential codes subsystems build up their own internal complexity one might think here of the various subspecialties of the legal system say or the specialization of disciplines in the education system discussed in chap ter 4 In doing so systems become ever more finely grained in their selectivity and thusin increasing the weblike density of their filters as it werethey buy time in relation to overwhelming environmental complexity As Luhmann puts it in Social Systems Systems lack the requisite variety Ashbys term that would enable them to react to every state of the environment    There is in other words no point forpoint correspondence between system and environment    The systems inferiority in complexity compared to that of the environ ment must be counterbalanced by strategies of selection43 Emersons way of putting this in Nominalist and Realist is that the world is full As the ancient said the world is plenum or solid and if we saw all things that really surround us we should be imprisoned and unable to move44 But if the selfreference of the systems code reduces the flow of environmental complexity into the system it also increases the systems irritability and thus in a real sense its dependence on the environment Hereand this is crucial to understanding the engine if you like of what Cavell calls Emersonian transience onwardness and abandonmentthe term complexity should be understood not as an aggregation of substance a big pile of lots of things or even as an abstract set of relations but more importantly as a set of temporalized re lations that have the character of the Derridean or Deleuzean event Systems use selfreference not just to build up their own internal com plexity but also to stabilize themselves in the temporal flow of events and render events meaningful for the system As Luhmann explains We need a concept of meaning    as the simultaneous presentation    of actuality and possibility45 The totality of the emer sons romanticism be actualized at any moment Thus the form of meaningthe co presentation of the difference between the actual and possiblethrough its referential structure forces the next step to selection46 But as we saw in chapter 1 that selection is only momentarily useful and dete riorates immediately under the pressure of the flow of time which in turn necessitates another selection and so on and so forth One could say Luhmann writes that meaning equips an actual experience or action with redundant possibilitiesnamely what was selected the actual and what could have been the possibleand this is crucial for any systems ability to respond to environmental complexity by build ing up its own complexity via the form of meaning through which the system uses time even as it is subjected to its pressure As Luhmann writes in a key passage we focused on in the opening chapter The genesis and reproduction of meaning presupposes an infrastructure in reality that constantly changes its states Meaning then extracts dif ferences which only as differences have meaning from this substruc ture to enable a differenceoriented processing of information On all meaning therefore are imposed a temporalized complexity and the compulsion to a constant shifting of actuality without meaning itself vibrating in tune with that substructure 63 Read against this background the rigor of moments such as this one in Emersons The Method of Nature becomes I believe more apparent The method of nature who could ever analyze it That rushing stream will not stop to be observed We can never surprise nature in a corner never find the end of a thread    The wholeness we admire in the order of the world is the result of infinite distribution    Its permanence is a perpetual inchoation Every natural fact is an emanation and that from which it emanates is an emanation also and from every emanation is a new emanation If anything could stand still it would be crushed and dissipated by the torrent it resisted and if it were a mind would be crazed as insane persons are those who hold fast to one thought and do not flow with the course of nature47 Subordinating the problem of selfreferential observation to the larger problem of complexity helps clarify why it is misguided at best to charge systems theory in general and the theory of autopoiesis in particular with asserting a kind of solipsistic relationship between the emer sons romanticism system and its environment As we have seen throughout the first half of this book what such a characterization misses is the seemingly para doxical fact that the autopoietic closure of a systemwhether social or psychicis precisely what connects it to its environment As Luhmann explains it The concept of a selfreferentially closed system does not contradict the systems openness to the environment Instead in the self referential mode of operation closure is a form of broadening possible environmental contacts closure increases by constituting elements more capable of being determined the complexity of the environment that is possible for the system48 Autopoiesis and complexity are conceptual coordinates    Dependency and independence in a simple causal sense are therefore not invariant magnitudes in that more of one would imply less of the other Rather they vary according to a systems given level of complexity In systems that are successful in evolutionary terms more independence typically amounts to a greater dependency on the environment    But all of this can happen only on the basis of the systems operative closure49 Or as Luhmann will put it in one of his more Zenlike moments Only complexity can reduce complexity50 All of this leads to a paradoxical situation that is central to Luhmanns work and central as we saw in the last chapter to under standing his reworking of problems inherited from Hegel and from romanticism more generallyproblems that bear directly on our read ing of Emerson What links the system to the world what literally makes the world available to the system is also what hides the world from the system what makes it unavailable Given our earlier discus sion of the problem of representing the unrepresentable this will sound like the familiar topos of the romantic sublime but with this crucial difference if all systems interface with their environments in terms of and only in terms of their own constitutive distinctions and selfreferential codes then the environment is not an ontological cate gory but a functional one That is to say it is not an outside to the system that is given as such but is rather always the outside of a specific inside Or as Luhmann deftly explains it the environment is different for every system because any system excludes only itself from its en vironment51 And with this turn Luhmann writes the distinction emer sons romanticism between selfreference and heteroreference is relocated within the ob served observing system or to put it another way the distinction between self and heteroreference is nothing other than the reentry of the distinction systemenvironment into the system itself52 As we have seen in greater detail in earlier chapters however this means that there is a paradoxical identity between the two sides of the systems constitutive distinction because the reentered distinc tion between both sides system and environment is itself a product of only one side the system Anda crucial corollaryno system can acknowledge this paradoxical identity of difference which is also in another sense simply the contingency of its own constitutive distinction and at the same time use that distinction to carry out its operations It must remain blind to the very paradox of the distinction that links it to its environment That does not mean that this blind spot cannot be observed from the vantage of another observer another system using another code but any secondorder observation will itself be based on its own blind spotthat is to say it will have the same contingency and the same formal character This is what Emerson is insisting on I think when he writes Nature will not be Buddhist she resents generalizing and insults the philosopher in every moment with a million fresh particulars It is all idle talking as much as a man is whole so is he also a part and it were partial not to see it What you say in your pompous distribution only distributes you into your class and section You have not got rid of parts by denying them but are the more partial You are one thing but na ture is one thing and the other thing in the same moment53 Such a passage may be quite precisely unpacked I think against the background of Luhmanns fruitful reworking of the Hegelian prob lematic that I have already discussed a difference that inheres in the contingency of selfreferential distinction itself you are one thing or in another sense in the difference between first and secondorder observation you have not got rid of parts by denying them but are the more partial And this is of course a productive difference from the vantage of the problem of overwhelming environmental complex ity and a systems need to reduce it it has no choice but to be54 This is what Emerson is reaching for in Nominalist and Realist emer sons romanticism I think when he writes that excluded attributes burst in on us with the more brightness that they have been excluded Your turn now my turn next is the rule of the game The universality being hindered in its primary form comes in the secondary form of all sides the points come in succession to the meridian and by the speed of rotation a new whole is formed 142 This might sound at first blush Hegelian but the key differencecontra the invocation of dialectic by Gonnaudis Emersons strident insistence on the primacy and paradoxical contin gency of the observer an insistence that reaches its peak in Essays Second Series As Luhmann in a passage I have had occasion to cite more than once explains the relationship between observation and what Emerson calls the horizon The source of a distinctions guaranteeing reality lies in its own op erative unity It is however precisely as this unity that the distinction cannot be observedexcept by means of another distinction which then assumes the function of a guarantor of reality Another way of expressing this is to say the operation emerges simultaneously with the world which as a result remains cognitively unapproachable to the operation The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the connection with the reality of the external world is established by the blind spot of the cognitive operation Reality is what one does not perceive when one perceives it55 The world is now conceived along the lines of a Husserlian metaphor as an unreachable horizon that retreats further with each operation without ever holding out the prospect of an outside56 This is the way Emersons essay Circles begins The eye is the first circle the hori zon which it forms is the second and throughout nature this primary figure is repeated without end    Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that around every circle another can be drawn that there is no end in nature but every end is a beginning57 The question thenand this is directly related to the problems raised by the topos of the romantic sublimeis in Luhmanns words how to observe how the world observes itself how a marked space emerges via a constitutive distinction from the unmarked space how something becomes invisible when something else becomes vis ible Any observation renders the world invisible in relation to its emer sons romanticism constitutive distinction and that invisibility must itself remain invis ible to the observation that employs that distinctionwhich in turn can only be disclosed by another observation that will also necessar ily be doubly blind in the same way58 Here is Emerson again from Circles There is no outside no inclosing wall on circumference to us The man finishes his storyhow good how final how it puts a new face on all things He fills the sky Lo on the other side rises also a man and draws a circle around the circle we had just pronounced the outline of the sphere Then already is our first speaker not man but only a first speaker His only redress is forthwith to draw a circle outside his antagonist And so do men by themselves59 In this two fold sense as Luhmann puts itwhat an observing distinction reveals and what it can be shown to hidethe notion of a final unityof an ultimate reality that cannot assume a form because it has no other sideis displaced into the unobservable    If the concept of the world is retained to indicate reality in its entirety then it is that whichto a secondorder observerremains invisible in the movements of obser vation his own and those of others60 We can return in this light to a rather different understanding of the significance of the Kantian settlement with skepticism reframed in terms of the signal importance of the formal dynamics of observation As Luhmann puts it succinctly if we ask what new insights the con cept of observation first and secondorder observation has to offer the answer is it traces the problem of unity back to the ultimate form of paradox 96 In a way Luhmann writes All this can be handled with the dereification of the concept of the world introduced already by Kant World is no longer a totality of things a universitas rerum but rather the final and therewith un observable condition of possibility of observations that is of every sort of use of distinctions To formulate this another way the world must be invisibilized so that observations become possible For every observation requires a blind spot or more precisely it can only in dicate one side of the distinction being used employing it as a start ing point for subsequent observations but not the distinction itself as a unity and above all not the unmarked space precisely the world from which every distinction as soon as it is marked as a distinction must be delimited61 emer sons romanticism Even more striking perhaps are the consequences of this fact as they are described by Luhmann and recorded with rather bracing astrin gency in essays like Emersons Experience Luhmann continues This invisibilization of the nevertheless doubtlessly given and presup posed world had dramatic consequences for Kant Fichte and above all for the Romantics Its leads to an overburdening of the individual with expectations regarding the production of meaning and therewith to the collapse of the communication weighed down with such expectations The individual endowed with reflection now received the title sub ject But the higher and more complex the expectations that subjects direct toward themselves and their others the greater is the probability of a failure of their communications 517 It is precisely this overburdening that haunts Emersons essay Experi ence where he writes We must hold hard to this poverty however scandalous and by more vigorous selfrecoveries after the sallies of action possess our axis more firmly The life of truth is cold and so far mournful but it is not the slave of tears contritions and pertur bations It is a truth we are told that all the muses and love and religion hate and they will find a way to punish the chemist who publishes in the parlor the secrets of the laboratory not the least of which is the quintessentially Emersonian announcement that it is very unhappy but too late to be helped the discovery we have made that we exist62 Such is what Luhmann calls the toxic quality of secondorder observation63 and it is on display not just in Emersons middle and late phase in Essays Second Series and The Conduct of Life but even in earlier works as well such as The American Scholar where he writes We are lined with eyes we see with our feet the time is infected with Hamlets unhappinessSicklied oer with the pale cast of thought Is it so bad then Sight is the last thing to be pitied Would we be blind64 Here too we may locate the signal advantage of systems theorys ability to combine epistemological and historical frames in ways that are especially useful for sorting out the relationship between Emersons thinking and his terminologyways that open up a rather different understanding of the relationship between Emersons thinking and writing from what we have already seen in Cavell What I have been emer sons romanticism arguing is that a term such as selfrecovery in the passage just cited should be understood not as recovery of a primordial preexistent self but as recovery of the onwardness of the selfs movement through which and only in whichas we have already seen in Cavells analysis of the proof of the self in SelfReliancethe self actually exists at all As Emerson puts it in Circles The way of life is wonderful It is by abandonment 181 Or more flatly still from Experience Life is a series of surprises and would not be worth taking or keeping if it were not 206 Selfrecovery then is paradoxically oriented not toward some originary state but toward futurity toward not being but becoming As Emerson writes in Circles Valor consists in the power of selfrecovery so that a man cannot have his flank turned cannot be outgeneraled but put him where you will he stands This can only be by preferring truth to his past apprehension of truth 177 italics mine Paradoxically as I have been arguing the only way for the Emersonian self to stand is to not stand to not stand still but to move in abandonment beyond the self of apprehension that one was only a second ago The only way to stand then is to understand to stand down if you like And the achievement of the self is now to be seen not as an active willing but as a maximally and paradoxically active passivity As Emerson puts it in Experience All I know is reception 212 This same misdirection could be found in a whole host of terms in Emerson Intuition Reason Law Spirit Being just to name a few that have encouraged readers for years to understand Emersons work as a quaintly failed metaphysics What systems theory enables us to do however is to map the residual versus emergent dimensions of Emersons work to use Raymond Williamss wellknown terms in ways not reducible to his terminology alone as Eduardo Cadava has done quite subtly I think with Emersons relationship to the discourse of race for which we have to attend to the systematicityand not just the lexiconof his thought65 Once we do so we find as Harro Muller puts it that selfdescriptions must themselves be temporalized    Assumptions of substance or of metahistoric essences metahistorical anthropologies metahistorically grounded notions of experience and so on are all forms of thought that are no longer reconcilable with func tional differentiation From Luhmanns perspective this is all part of emer sons romanticism an oldEuropean heritage that    can at best be correlated with the still existing stratificatory elements in modern society66 Which is simply to explain in so many words why Experienceeven as it also uses the term selfrecoveryis a far more original and forwardlooking text than Nature Moreover it confronts in a number of emotional and philosophi cal registers another consequence noted by Luhmann that the forc ing of subjectivity as the single answer to the problem of world makes intersubjectivity difficult indeed if one is conceptually rigorous ac tually impossible67 As I have suggested elsewhere it is precisely on the basis of the disclosure of that impossibility that the possibility of democracy is foundedbut only as Cavell would put it by being un founded or left foundering68 But rather than pursue that argument further here I will simply end with the last lines of Emersons essay Nominalist and Realist which enigmatically beautifully madden ingly gathers together some of the threads I have been tracing only to throw them to the winds Is it that every man believes every other to be an incurable partialist and himself an universalist I talked yesterday with a pair of philoso phers I endeavored to show my good men that I liked everything by turns and nothing long that I loved the centre but doated on the su perficies that I loved man if men seemed to me mice and rats    that I was glad of men of every gift and nobility but would not live in their arms Could they but once understand that I loved to know that they existed and heartily wished them Godspeed yet out of my poverty of life and thought had no word or welcome for them when they came to see me and could well consent to their living in Oregon for any claim I felt on them it would be a great satisfaction69 This page intentionally left blank Systems Theory Poetry and Form beyond Formalism In this chapter I will revisit on the terrain of literary art generally and poetry specifically some of the questions examined in my earlier discussion of contemporary architecture in light of recent work in sys tems theory I also hope to show how my earlier attempts to use systems theory to rethink fundamental questions associated with romanticism can open up a space in which we may describe more precisely the be guiling formal questions that attend the work of romantic modern ists such as Wallace Stevens In extending this line of investigation regarding the theory of art and more specifically the relations or dis relations between literature and more specifically poetry and other art forms such as architecture music and sculpture I also hope to in tervene in recent conversations driven by a resurgence of interest over the past decade in the question of form in literary and cultural studies The fundamental contours and stakes of those recent conversations are brought out magisterially and with characteristic evenhandedness by Marjorie Levinson in a PMLA essay on the changing profession titled What Is New Formalism Levinson the idea of observation at k ey w est of historicism to treat artworks as bundles of historical and cultural content In place of this simpleminded mimesis it wants to restore to todays reductive reinscription of historical reading its original focus on form of the sort found in the materialist critiques of Adorno Marx Althusser Jameson and Macherey As for the second it attempts to bring back a sharp demarcation between history and art discourse and literature with form regarded as the condition of aesthetic expe rience as traced to Kantie disinterested autotelic playful pleasur able consensusgenerating and therefore both individually liberating and conducive to affect social cohesion the prerogative of art1 This last assertion leads us in turn to the first of two important ob servations by Levinson first that for many of these critics the concept of form as productive rather than merely reflective as one critic cited by her puts it serves an essentially humanist project of edificationit takes on a broadly pedagogical humanizing cast reviving Schillers model of aesthetic education 563 Second as Levinson his wellknown articulation of the autopoietic closure and difference of psychic systems and social systems consciousness and communi cation which I have discussed in previous chapters It is within the context of this difference that Luhmann understands the significance to poetry of characteristic themes and problems such as incommuni cability ineffability silence and so on But he understands them spe cifically within a posthumanist context that is to say as expressions not of a psychological or emotional interiority or intentionality that reveals itself in language even if only to gesture toward languages inadequacy in the face of the ineffable but as expressions of a set of differencesmost importantly the difference between communi cation and perception which in poetry are miraculously made to coincide as he puts it when the material form of the signifier seems to duplicate the semantics of communication in familiar devices such as rhyme rhythm and so on Or we might say even more precisely in light of W K Wimsatts famous thesis about the differential relations of semantics and acoustics in rhymed English poetry in his classic essay One Relation of Rhyme to Reason in which the material form of the signifier has a systematic relation to the semantic content of words even if that relationship is systematically as Wimsatt suggested in English rhyme one of difference or contrast3 But this is only part of the story and what I want to insist on here is that in Luhmanns scattered writings on poetry we need to separate and indeed disarticulate two main strands that tend to get confused what we might call the perceptual or the phenomenological on the one hand which has to do with the familiar prosodic aspects of poetry that I just mentioned and on the other what we might call poetrys abstract formal aspect Take for example the following passage from Art as a Social System The choice of words as a medium creates a compelling and unusu ally dense combination of selfreference and heteroreference run ning through the entire text Words carry and signify their ordinary meanings and this is why they refer to something other not just to themselves At the same time however they also carry and signify a special textual meaning within which they execute and propel the texts recursions Textart organizes itself by means of selfreferential the idea of observation at k ey w est unity of selfreference and heteroreference lies in the sensuous percep tibility of words4 There are it seems to me two different claims here one having to do with the abstract recursive dynamics of selfreference in relation to the form of the artwork as such and one having specifically to do with the perceptual material aspects of words used as a medium typically associated with traditional prosodic devices I want to insist that these two be kept rigorously separate for to elide them is to obscure the most profound and original aspect of Luhmanns work on art which is his mobilization of a specific concept of form to make sense of arts special relationship special that is visàvis the other social systems to the paradoxical dynamics of selfreference and observation What I want to bring out here is how in Luhmanns analysis the perceptual and the material are radically subordinated to the problem of form and to forms relationship to the paradoxical dynamics of observa tion I would even argue more forcefully that the former is even in a fundamental sense superfluous to what makes poetry art at all in Luhmanns senseand is superfluous in a way that helps us under stand how paradoxically poetry that is least replete with prosodic fea tures such as stanzaic regularity rhyme alliteration and so on I have in mind here the work of a Wallace Stevens say or a Marianne Moore to name two can in a sense be regarded for that very reason as most poetic in the specific sense developed by Luhmann I am going to focus here however briefly on the Stevens Luhmann pairing because both have been associated so insistently and have often associated themselveswith the core problems of ro manticism that make their way from Kant and Hegel through Coleridge and British romanticism then detour importantly for Stevens if we believe Harold Bloom via Emerson in the United States to more recent inheritors such as the phenomenology of Husserl5 In a classic essay from about twenty years ago Albert Gelpi used the StevensWilliam Carlos Williams relationship to tease out the contours of the roman tic problematic inherited by Stevens What Gelpi called the romantic modernism of Stevens and Williams aimed to restore the primacy of the imagination in poetry versus the historically and anthropo logically oriented antiromantic modernism of Pound and Eliot and it plagued romanticism round one This consisted chiefly in what Gelpi calls the unstable Romantic synthesis of subject or imagination and object or world in which the individual became the inspired locus for an intuitive perception of the spiritual forms and energies that invested the otherwise fragmented phenomenal world with an ex alted coherence6 Stevens and Williams Gelpi writes considered the chief challenge to the Modernist poetone of lifeordeath urgency to be the redefinition of the function of the imagination liberating it from its shaky epistemological premises 5 But what this ends up meaningtheir solution if you likeis that the twentiethcentury poet became less the recipient than the agent of perception or as Williams put it attempting to finesse the problem further the poem rejects plagiarism after nature and constructs a reality not opposed to nature but apposed to it In Gelpis words in its apposition to na ture the verbal construct serves to mediate the epistemological schism between subject and object 6 Really How so What I would like to suggest is that such solutions are simply renamings of the fundamental problem that concerns Gelpiand con cerned Stevens And so in Gelpis essay we find simply a series of such restatements for Stevens for example sensation is not just a passively received impression but an actively and accurately achieved response 7 But what can accurately mean here given everything weve just said And where we end up then is pretty much where we began While Modernism constitutes on one level an overt and programmatic rejection of Romanticism it constitutes on another level an extension of the epistemological issues that the decadence of Romanticism pre cipitated In terms of the subjectobject split Imagism and for Gelpi Williams represents the attempt to render the objects of experience Symbolism and for Gelpi Stevens the attempt to render subjective psychological and affective states    Faced with the polarity between subject and object we must try to accommodate both terms and under that pressure the terms tend to slip in and out of one another 12 Gelpis diagnosis of the problem is also a symptom of the need to find a more precise way of describing itand describing how what is apparently most paradoxical and selfdefeating about it is actually the idea of observation at k ey w est what is most specific and productive about it With the help of systems theory I think that the core problem here can be stated precisely it is the paradoxical fact that both selfreference and heteroreference or otherreference are themselves both products of selfreference Where do we go from here and why is this not a form of philo sophical idealism are two questions that the rest of this chapter will attempt to address In doing so I hope to also suggest that the problem with understanding Stevenss romantic modernism has been more a problem with the criticism itself his own included by the way than with the poetry In fact it seems to me that Stevenss poetry navigates the problems outlined by Gelpi with a rigor subtlety and keenness for which we have had no adequate critical vocabulary thus far What I want to suggestand I can only gesture toward it here is that Luhmanns work is especially valuable in helping us to tease out and if you like formalize the poetics of the mature Stevens which for many readers take on an increasingly paradoxical cast and philosophi cal austerity as his career tends more and more to late poems such as An Ordinary Evening in New Haven Or to put this slightly other wise Stevenss own description of that poetic project in texts like The Necessary Angel and in doctrines if we can call them that such as the supreme fiction has seemed for many readers rather disappointing and insufficiently articulated alongside the rigor and precision of the poetry itselfa rigor that is not logical or conceptual exactly but is nevertheless what I would call a systematic confrontation with the problems I have already sketched under the rubric of romanticism In particular Stevens puts increasingly intense pressure as few poets have on the problem of observation its paradoxical dynamics in rela tion to reality and imagination all of which and this would be an other different kind of chapter are traced by Luhmann to the funda mental structures of modernity itself namely as I have noted in earlier chapters modernity as functional differentiation But to return to the question at hand to understand why po etry that is least poetic in prosodic terms may be seen as most poetic in Luhmanns terms we have to remember the point emphasized earlier in chapter 8 that in Luhmanns work on art the difference between perception and communication is paramount The meaning of a work of art cannot be reduced to its perceptual material or phenomenal as pect this is we will remember the lesson for Luhmann of a Duchamp a Cage oras I suggested earlierKawaras Date Paintings Instead the work of art copresents the difference between perception and com munication and reenters that difference on the side of its own commu nication its own meaning To understand how this happens we need to recall not just that perception and beyond that consciousness and communication op erate in mutually exclusive operationally closed autopoietic systems though they are structurally coupled through media such as language we also need to remember that the relationship between them is asym metrical7 The mind is its own operationally closed biological system but because it is also a necessary medium for communication we can say that the mind has the privileged position of being able to disturb stimulate and irritate communication 379 The mind the psychic system in other words constantly produces noise in systems the ory parlance for the communication system the social system and the challenge for communication is thus how to secure the necessary participation of psychic systems while at the same time ensuring its own continuation through the autopoiesis of its own structures and not those of the psychic system8 The irreducibility and asymmetry of perception to communica tion are crucial for several reasons First perception and communi cation operate at different speedsand this is something art puts to good use The faster speed of perception and neuronal processing makes it appear that perception stabilizes and makes immediate while communication which operates with a sequential selective process differs and defers9 Luhmann observes that perception in contrast to thought and communication can decide quickly whereas art aims to retard perception and render it reflexivelingering upon the object in visual art in striking contrast to everyday perception and slow ing down reading in literature particularly lyric poetry10 In the work of art this difference between perception and communication is then reentered on the side of the artworks communication 142a com munication that accomplishes this goal or fails to do so by facing the usual and perhaps even increased risks involved in all communica tion Art communicates by using perceptions contrary to their primary purpose 22 As a reentered element in arts communication then the idea of observation at k ey w est perception serves the following role What strikes us in an art form as in a different way does the conspicuous character of acoustic and optic signalsengenders a fascination that turns into information by changing the state of the observers systemas a difference that makes a difference 26 In fact as we have already noted this difference is what allows art to have a special relationship to what is commonly invoked as the ineffable or the incommunicable And it is also as Luhmann shrewdly combine elements of sound rhythm and meaning 26 But poetry is not just rhymed prose he continues If one reads poetry as a sequence of propositions about the world and considers the poetic only as beautification adornment or decoration one does not observe it as a work of art    Only at the level where symbols sounds meanings and rhythms conspirea level that is dif ficult to readdo poems refer to themselves in the process of creating forms They generate contextual dependencies ironic the idea of observation at k ey w est literature of romanticism such as unity in multeity but as Luhmann points out It should be clear by now that this analysis precludes com prehending an artwork in terms of the relations between a whole and its parts Dividing a work and judging the relationship between parts misses its internal nexus a nexus that is about the recursive and para doxical selfreference of form that is not limited to the sensuous aspect of words 120 italics mine If one wants to isolate parts he contin ues then one discovers that their contribution to the work consists in what they are not what they make available for further elaboration 120 This amounts in a way to a deconstruction of Coleridges dis tinction between fancy and imaginationin which the workings of fancy Luhmanns slow linear processes of communication are focused on the aggregative combinatory buildup of resemblances and variations in a concept or trope in a mechanic and logical fashion as Coleridge put it while consciousness and imagination are preoccupied with an intuitive grasp of the works form of recursive selfreference on the most abstract level the larger organic or unifying power to use Coleridges terms that these fanciful combinations serve It also helps to clarify the relationship between a systems theoreti cal analysis of art and the discourse of the romantic sublime because in this wayas I have already suggested in the discussions of both Emersons philosophy and contemporary architecturethe problems that the discourse of the sublime attempts to address can be assimi lated to the more formally rigorous schema of the difference between first and secondorder observation in systems theory Firstorder ob servations we recall use distinctions as a schema but do not yet cre ate a contingency for the observer himself as Luhmann puts it The distinction is postulated but not designated in the designation it thus does not act in a way that would make it apparent that it could be otherwise11 Secondorder observations on the other hand provide grounds for including contingency in meaning and perhaps reflecting upon it conceptually because they are observations of observations they take into account the codes and distinctions used by firstorder ob servers including what those distinctions leave out or occludetheir latencies Or as Luhmann puts it Everything becomes contingent whenever what is observed depends on who is being observed 48 Most of alland here the line of descent from German romanti cism through Emerson and on to both Luhmann and Stevens is espe cially clearsecondorder observations take account of the fact that the two sides of a distinction which appear in firstorder observation as opposites are in fact when seen by secondorder observation de pendent on a deeper unity what in Hegelian parlance would be called the identity of identity and nonidentity As I have emphasized in earlier chapters it is that paradoxical identityofdifference to which the firstorder system must remain blind if it is to use that code to carry out its own operations and observations But the same is true for any secondorder observations as well Observation of the second order Luhmann writes retains throughout the operative charac teristics of all observation    The concept of observation remains in variant for the first and second orders and requires no other language metalanguage 49 Thusand this is the key point for rewriting the problematics of the romantic sublimefor Luhmann any observation renders the world invisible in relation to its constitutive selfreferential distinc tion in the sense that the very thing that makes the world cognitively or communicationally available is also the very thing that occludes it and renders it invisible by its selectivity and that invisibility must it self remain invisible to the observation that employs that distinction which in turn can only be disclosed by another observation that will also necessarily be doubly blind in the same way12 In this twofold sense Luhmann writes the notion of a final unityof an ultimate reality that cannot assume a form because it has no other sideis dis placed into the unobservable    If the concept of the world is retained to indicate reality in its entirety then it is that whichto a second order observerremains invisible in the movements of observation his own and those of others 91 So on the one hand Luhmann explains a work of art must distinguish itself externally from other objects and events or it will lose itself in the world it closes itself off by limiting further possibilities with each of its formal decisions On the other hand whatever distinction is used at any given time cannot be indicated as a unitythis condition reproduces itself with every dis tinction It merely displaces the blind spot of observation 29 As Luhmann summarizes it in a key formulation With this mediation we arrive at a world extant in the difference between the the idea of observation at k ey w est sameness and otherness of observations of the first and second order As so often elsewhere it is also true here reducing complexity by de ploying observations is the means to generate complexity13 And this meansas I emphasized earlier in my discussion of Diller  Scofidios Blurnot only that art can no longer be understood as an imitation of something that presumably exists along with and outside of art but more importantly for our purposes that to the extent that imitation is still possible it now imitates the worlds invisibility a nature that can no longer be apprehended as a whole14 The paradox unique to art which art creates and resolves Luhmann writes resides in the observability of the unobservable 149 And it is here that form finds its function It is important to note however that the word formal here does not refer to the distinction which at first guided modern art between form and matter or form and content but to the characteristics of an indicating operation that observes as if from the corner of its eye what happens on the other side of form In this way the work of art points the observer toward an observation of form    It consists in demonstrating the compelling forces of order in the realm of the possible 148 In this way form stages the question of whether an observer can ob serve at all except with reference to an order 148 but it also stages the contingency of that orderthat is to say the production of the unobservable the blind spot of observation the outside of the art work that unavoidably accompanies such observations 149 The function of art is to make the world appear within the world with an eye toward the ambivalent situation that every time something is made available for observation something else withdraws that in other words the activity of distinguishing and indicating that goes on in the world conceals the world    Yet a work of art is capable of symbol izing the reentry of the world into the world because it appearsjust like the worldincapable of emendation 149 italics mine The work of art to put it succinctly is radically contingent and at the same time constituted by internal necessity To return to the issue of poetry specifically what this means for a poet like Wallace Stevens is that the less poetic Stevens isthe more we find an absence of the traditional prosodic devices rhyme allit eration etc that foreground the difference between perception and communicationthe more poetic he is in the specific sense of formally modeling the very dynamics of the observableunobservable that Luhmann describes This example helps clarify too the difference be tween Luhmanns recursive selfreference of form and say Jakobsons notion of the projection of the principle of reduplication from the axis of selection to the axis of combination in poetic discourse To put this in an even better way the paring away of conspicuous poetic features in Stevenss work can be seen as functioning in two different ways First it serves a communication in which the motivated refusal to indulge traditional prosodic devices is an important element of the poetrys meaning it communicates its meaning by not being present a calculated formal decision that signifies against its literaryhistorical background along the lines of Miles Daviss famous pronouncement that what is important is not the the idea of observation at k ey w est understood precisely in the terms made available by Luhmann Stevenss poetics of increasingly rigorous refinement and arid abstraction moves steadily away from a dependence on the perceptual and the prosodic and force us to fix our attention on the fundamentaland fundamen tally paradoxicalaspect of poetry and of art generally as Luhmann de fines it the crucial determinations between the question of form and the paradoxical relations of the visible and invisible the observable and un observable which have typically been handled in literature and philoso phy under the rubrics of the sublime imagination versus fancy and so on For how else are we to account for much less explain Stevenss pen chant for not just courting but pressuring paradox as few poets have the Stevens whose fundamental mode is to repeatedly insist on both things as they are The Man with the Blue Guitar and what I saw  Or heard or felt came not but from myself Tea at the Palaz of Hoon But not just Stevens one might add I offer here without fur ther comment the opening stanza of Laura Ridings remarkable poem Opening of Eyes Thought looking out on thought Makes one an eye One is the mind selfblind The other is thought gone To be seen from afar and not known Thus is a universe very soon16 Or the wonderfully realized and only slightly less beguiling The World and I here in its entirety This is not exactly what I mean Any more than the sun is the sun But how to mean more closely If the sun shines but approximately What a world of awkwardness What hostile implements of sense Perhaps this is as close a meaning As perhaps becomes such knowing Else I think the world and I Must live together as strangers and die A sour love each doubtful whether Was ever a thing to love the other No better for both to be nearly sure Each of eachexactly where Exactly I and exactly the world Fail to meet by a moment and a word 187 Those paradoxical dynamics of observation and selfreference are obviously on display as well in a whole host of Stevens poems and they achieve a pitch and resonance not unlike Ridings at the end of Esthétique du Mal where Stevens recurs to the same figural and phenomenological topos One might have thought of sight but who could think Of what it sees for all the ill it sees Speech found the ear for all the evil sound But the dark italics it could not propound And out of what one sees and hears and out Of what one feels who could have thought to make So many selves so many sensuous worlds As if the air the midday air was swarming With the metaphysical changes that occur Merely in living as and where we live17 And it receives what one might call even more technical topographical treatment in The Idea of Order at Key West which is careful to dis tinguish the observations of the single artificer addressed in the poem and the observations of those observationsand their significanceby the speaker and his strange companion pale Ramon Fernandez Stevens is characteristically assiduous when he writes It was her voice that made The sky acutest at its vanishing She measured to the hour its solitude She was the single artificer of the world In which she sang And when she sang the sea Whatever self it had became the self That was her song for she was the maker Then we As we beheld her striding there alone Knew that there never was a world for her Except the one she sang and singing made 12930 italics mine the idea of observation at k ey w est This does not mean that we are dealing here with concepts for as we have already seen art consists precisely in presenting what cannot be conceptualized but can nevertheless be communicatedand com municated in the case of this poem by the poems staging and restag ing of and increasingly recursive responses to the central question of the poem Whose spirit is this we said because we knew It was the spirit that we sought and knew That we should ask this often as she sang 129 italics mine But why not ask this just once Because apparently it cannot be answered only oncethat is once and for all a fact the poem recursively builds up through the increasing submission of its key terms song sea to a relentlessly erosive provisional phalanx of ands buts ifs and yets Or to put it in Luhmanns terms the song of the single artificer her observation that makes the sky acutest at its vanishingdiscloses a spirit and not a substance not the binaries of mindnature subject object imaginationreality and so on among which we must choose as either philosophical idealists or realists but rather a form a movement of observation whose engine is double and for that reason irreducible with no resting place the paradoxical differenceinidentity of obser vations constitutive structure and the difference between first and secondorder observations a difference that by definition of course takes time Thus not song or sea but a third term spirit And hence the only answer to the question Whose spirit is this would not be indeed could not beeither song or sea but might be oddly enough Often18 I put it in this odd way to clarify that we are not dealing here simply with problems of logic Quite the contrary for as Luhmann writes the problem of the paradoxical selfreference of any observa tion cannot be solved by logical maneuvering but one can only    hope to find a less sensitive spot where the problem can be temporarily tolerated which leads in turn to the realization that paradoxes can be undertaken more or less skillfully can have a more or less unblock ing effect can be more or less fruitful19 As in art for example Indeed this is perhaps what Stevens meant when he suggestedrather enig matically after allthat the function of the poet is to help people to live their lives Such is the spirit I think of Stevenss suggestion about the poets function earlier in that same passage that certainly it is not to lead people out of the confusion in which they find them selves Nor is it I think to comfort them while they follow their read ers to and fro20 But it is also not just a problem of logic in a second and more important and compelling sensea sense that once again depends on our paying attention to the disarticulation of consciousness and com munication that we have insisted on in these pages For as Luhmann observes in his  the idea of observation at k ey w est selfreferenceand the experience of it as an actuality in the disjunc tion between consciousness and communication the experience of something that in a way is impossible and yet oscillates before us reveals that the inference from nondescribability to nonexistence is not logically tenable22 And this question opens in turn on to another that I cannot pursue adequately in this book though it is surely already on the table in chapter 3 the relations and disrelations of philosophy and literature in the services of that broader thing called knowledge Or as Stevens puts it in Metaphors of a Magnifico Twenty men crossing a bridge Into a village Are twenty men crossing twenty bridges Into twenty villages Or one man Crossing a single bridge into a village This is old song That will not declare itself Twenty men crossing a bridge Into a village Are Twenty men crossing a bridge Into a village That will not declare itself Yet is certain as meaning    Poems 19 A pure paradox an utter tautology And yet somehow true Or perhaps we should say real 11 The Digital the Analog and the Spectral Echographies from My Life in the Bush of Ghosts When Brian Eno and David Byrnes record My Life in the Bush of Ghosts was rereleased on its twentyfifth anniversary in 2006 it occa sioned much reflection on a piece of music that many listeners felt was far ahead of its timeand many felt on rerelease had never gotten its just critical desserts The record wasnt neglected by any means but as Byrne points out in the liner the digital the analog and the spectr al New Orleans just to name a fewthe record seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere And with this polyglot glossolalia anchored to a musical fusion of electronica funk and Afrofuturism the record seemed to issue simultaneously from both the past and the future communicating the portents of ancient and wrathful gods and demons while at the same time constituting a kind of synthdriven laboratory for the music of the future or what one critic at the time called avant funk A record from a Fourth World to borrow Jon Hassells term from everywhere and nowhere past and future1 In a word spectral On another level the uncanniness of the Bush of Ghosts project may be understood as a kind of echography to use the phrase of Bernard Stiegler and Jacques Derrida from their conversations collected as Echographies of Television of an electronic medium whose apotheo sis so the story goes is the digitalizationofallmedia discussed and sometimes debunked in texts such as Lev Manovichs The Language of New Media2 To put it far too telegraphically my suggestion here will be that the ByrneEno record proleptically evokes what will become the seething hiving bush of digital media and then populates it haunts it with analog ghosts Moreover that echography takes the form of a strategic resistance to a generic disembodied abstract rendering and I mean that in a technical sense as well see of both the voice and the image under digital media whose maximal expression might well be viewed as Donna Haraway long ago pointed out as the US military operations theory C3Icommandcontrolcommunication intelligenceand its recent manifestation for example in the video images now widely circulated on the Internet of various smart weapon systems used by the United States in both Gulf Wars3 It is worth noting in this connection that the original LP was conceived and recorded on the heels of the year 1979 a year of ominous geopolitical upheaval that included the Iranian hostage crisis and the Soviet inva sion of Afghanistan the connections between the US support of the Mujahideen resistance to the Soviets in Afghanistan and the rise of alQaeda are common knowledge at this point and the anniversary rerelease took place of course at the height of the second Gulf War and the occupation of Iraq In these multiple contexts the original LPs ample use of vocal materials from Islam and more pointedly still the expurgation of the track Quran from all but the initial vinyl and CD the digital the analog and the spectr al releases4 makes the record all the more uncannya circumstance made even spookier by the fact that the omission of Quran goes un remarked in both the ByrneEno and David Toop liner the digital the analog and the spectr al from the globalization of capitalism and in particular capitalisms tight ening of the relationship between information and commodification10 Equally important is the logic of rendering in not just economic but biopolitical forms of organization As Nicole Shukin has argued rendering not only is an expression of what Foucault famously calls biopower but also has its roots in the process of rendering animal flesh in the disassembly lines of the Chicago stockyards of the early twentieth centurya process viewed by over a million people during the Worlds Columbian Exposition of 1893 It also had a profound in fluence on Henry Ford and thus on the first automobile assembly line processes in the United States all of which Shukin reminds us were contemporary with Eadweard Muybridges experiments with animal images in his Zoopraxiscope in the 1890s This fundamental discreti zation and reorganization of the assemblage of knowledges and per ceptions in and around the problem of bodies movement and time is Shukin argues a prolepsis of the cinematic as she puts it in the vertical abattoir can be discerned not only the logistical prototype of cars and films material production assembly suture but also the mi metic blueprint for a new order of aesthetic experience11 But to read the significance of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts as only an expression of those economic social and biopolitical forces would be to engage in another sort of fundamentalism a fundamentalism calculated to flee precisely those sorts of ghosts that Derridas work will help us identify and as it were reanimate Digital media as Bernard Stiegler puts it depend above all on a sys tematic discretization and grammaticalization of contentitself part of the larger regime of what Derrida calls calculation whose philosophical and ethical resonances I have explored in some detail in earlier chapters12 Unlike the analog photographic image for example and here we will return to some of the questions of visual media that occupied us in chapter 6 in the digital image one has as Stiegler puts it access to the diacritical manipulation of the light and of all of the ele ments which are differentiated therein with surgical precision 154 This eventuates in the compilation of lexicons of animated objects in the movement industries in the ability of digital technologies to recognize automatically different camera movements identical ob the digital the analog and the spectr al jects present in a film recurrent charactersall of which was first developed as he points out for the colorization of blackandwhite films To this must be added synthetic libraries of objects and move ments expressions sounds of morphing cloning embedding and capture which are crucial to the computergeneratedimage indus try and the process of digital rendering 157 For example as Mary Flanagan points out research teams working on earlier forms of the digitalization of movement used custom software to choose areas such as the mouth eyes and face of simple 2D photographs and    algorithms to mathematically control the 2D image In this way one can create inverse kinematic animation to simulate human move ment without parsing stream after stream of real user body data but the tradeoff is that a former whole is segmented proportioned and divided13 More recently such processes have given way to extremely so phisticated kinds of modeling that go far beyond even motioncapture technologies that render movement by means of mathematically plot ting data from sensors or markers placed on a moving body One par ticularly striking example of this new form of rendering reported in the New York Times on October 15 2006 is the work being done by Image Metrics Inc in California which uses software to map an actors per formance onto any character virtual or human living or dead While motion capture wires actors with small digital sensors and a newer technique called Contour tracks actors facial and body movements by coating them with phosphorescent powder Image Metrics starts with a generic model of the human head and layers onto that a mathe matical distillation of an individuals expressions IM thus solves the main problem with motion capture and standard computergenerated imagery CGIhow to convincingly render the eyes the inner part of the lips and the tongue The technique is remarkably convincing so much so that IMs chairman declares I like to call it soul transference The model has the actresss soul It shows through14 The Times reporter upon observing a demonstration at Image Metrics says that the computergenerated avatar appears to possess something ineffable something that seems to go beneath the skin and calls the effect of watching actress and computer model side by side more than a little bit creepy But what is creepy here I would suggest the digital the analog and the spectr al is the presumption of the images transparency and exhaustibility that there is nothing hidden to renderingnot even the soul Or as Stiegler puts it the machine sees planes detects them automatically mechanically Because it neither believes nor knows anything it isnt afraid of any defect it isnt haunted by any ghosts15 It is the restora tion of those ghosts that the ByrneEno project engages in and I mean project here in the broadest sense not just the record My Life in the Bush of Ghosts but also the visual art elements associated with it album covers etc and beyond that Brian Enos own video works What is particularly interesting howeverand here we can begin to appreciate the full resonance of the line from Hamlet that Derrida seizes on The time is out of jointis that the ByrneEno project engages in that restoration or reanimation before the advent of the pervasive digitalization of media In fact as has been widely noted My Life in the Bush of Ghosts engages in what would come to For the Emily Project Image Metrics animated a photorealistic CG face of the actress Emily OBrien and applied it to the real version of her body Courtesy of Image Metrics Ltd the digital the analog and the spectr al be known as sampling before sampling had really become a wide spread practice much less a codified term As Byrne points out in his Ghosts liner the digital the analog and the spectr al on the screen would be infinitely multiplied And by fussing with the color setting on the backs of the TV sets one could saturate and skew the color quite a bit I also took some pictures of just skewed vortexes and whorls of color and then we did some images where we skewed the color on pictures that had been taken of ourselves and then took polaroids of the results Somehow    these techniques also seemed analogous to what we were doing on the record16 Indeed they are analogous for reasons that Enos descriptions of his own contemporaneous video paintings help to bring out Eno started out working with a Panasonic industrial video camera that he bought from a roadie for the band Foreigner who were working in an adjacent studio while Eno was producing the Talking Heads third album Fear of Music As he recounts it the camera had no automatic controls and the manual controls which were analog had extremely wide ranges and tolerances You could do absolutely mad things with this camera he recalls in fact it was very hard to do anything real istic with it Moreover shortly after he bought the camera he made David Byrne Polaroid photograph from My Life in the Bush of Ghosts sessions the digital the analog and the spectr al the mistake of leaving it on and pointing at the sky for four days which completely fried the tube But after that he says it produced the most magical results and responded to light and colour in a way no other camera did17 Similarly the discovery of his signature video format came about by serendipity After he got the camera he didnt have a tripod so he laid it on its side on the window sill with the lens pointed out toward the Manhattan skyline which meant he also had to turn the TV onto its side to read the image The result he recounts was an absolute breakthrough because suddenly the screen looked not like television but like painting And this was important for two reasons first you lose the reference to theatre and cinema associated with the television surface and format and this is important because in the proscenium format you expect narrative which entails among other things an entire formatting indeed calculation to use Derridas term of time and event And second as Eno realized years later when he attempted the same thing with digital TVs the distortion on the television screen Brian Eno still from Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan 198081 the digital the analog and the spectr al created by the horizontal scanlines enabled with the screen turned on its side a unique rainfall effect turning mere analog static into valu able atmosphere as it were18 Enos perceptive comments underscore an important fact what undoes the calculated formatting of narrative and time is the interplay of form and the cultural expectations elicited and reproduced by it as in the proscenium or screen format with what Gregory Bateson calls the real magnitudes of analog media it depends for its effects on the specific embodied positionality and movement of its components for example the proximity of the video camera to the television screen on which it creates feedback and distortion19 This means that analog is spooky or spectral for the regime of rendering because among other things it depends on the interplay of material forces and bodies in cluding even things like the weather it is not wholly subsumable or predictable by programs and schemata simply because the interplay of real magnitudes in spacetime is fundamentally and even inexhaustibly Brian Eno still from Thursday Afternoon 1984 the digital the analog and the spectr al contingent creating a reservoir of complexity and contingency that is in principle bottomless That is not to say however that the analog is the opposite or the real other of the digital that it haunts Rather the structure of any discretization any diacritical system is that of a trace in Derridas sensethe iterability in and through which it can function and only can function as a medium and archive hence my earlier emphasis on interplay As Derrida puts it in a passage I have invoked more than once in this study this pure difference which constitutes the selfpresence of the living present introduces into selfpresence from the beginning all the impurity putatively excluded from it And what this means in turn is that the trace is the intimate relation of the liv ing present to its outside the opening to exteriority in general20 Such is the corrupting and contaminating workbut also the haunting or spectral character if you willof iterability which thus entails the necessity of thinking at once both the rule and the event concept and singularity that marks the essential and ideal limit of all pure ideali zation but not as the concept of nonideality as idealitys pure other In this sense as Derrida puts it remains heterogeneous to rather than simply opposed to the order of the ideal and the calculablethat is to say to the realm of grammaticalization and discretization21 The ana log in short does not exist as a presence a substance an as such or the the of the body What this means as I suggested in chapter 3 is that in Derridas words teletechnology and finally tekhné generally prohibits us more than ever    from opposing presence to its representation real time to deferred time effectivity to its simulacrum the living to the nonliving in short the living to the livingdead of its ghosts22 This unmappable difference impels us in turn beyond present life    its empirical or ontological actuality not toward death but toward a livingon survie namely a trace of which life and death would them selves be but traces    a survival whose possibility in advance comes to disjoin or disadjust the identity to itself of the living present23 The living present in other words is haunted by the ghosts or specters of what will have been once any kind of archive analog or digital or the most fundamental archive of all language itself in the broad est sense of a dynamic semiosis that as we saw in chapters 3 and 4 the digital the analog and the spectr al encompasses language proper and is in no way reducible to itis ac tivated It is spectral Derrida holds because we know that once it has been taken captured this image will be reproducible in our ab sence because we know this already we are already haunted by this future which brings our death Our disappearance is already here24 The logic of the specter he continues thus regularly exceeds all the oppositions between visible and invisible both phenomenal and nonphenomenal a trace that marks the present with its absence in ad vance 117 In short the analog never manifests itself as a purity a presence or an ideality Far from being a kind fatalism or necrophilia however it is pre cisely in this fact that futurity itself residesthe fact that the words we record now the images we make now will be iterable in our absence and indeed in the absence of any empirical being currently alive in the living present We are spectralized by the shot as Derrida puts it captured or possessed by spectrality in advance 117 but such is the price of a futurity in which our media our archives are to be legible in our absence And here the logic of spectrality shades over in Derridas work into the question of the messianicwe die so that they the future ones may livebut it is as he puts it a messianism without a messiah since after all that future and the ones who live it to whom we reach out may not come to pass It is not guaranteed in other words and that is precisely what makes it an ethical act an act of faith25 As Derrida puts it a messianism without guarantees without a particular incarnation of the messianic might elicit despair in some but without this latter despair and if one could count on what is com ing hope would be but the calculation of a program    Some and I do not exclude myself will find this despairing messianism has a curi ous taste a taste of death26 All of which provides a context for understanding the inadequacy in a way the backwardnessof the often observed and lamented fact about digital media that as Raley puts it telepresence absorbs im mediate presence and produces distance27 But Derridas pointand it would lead us eventually to the observation that David Wills makes about the almost Platonic lament that sometimes characterizes Paul Virilios discourse28is that the deadening or derealization typi cally associated with digital technologies versus the ontological um the digital the analog and the spectr al bilical cord of analog is always already in play with any form of repre sentation any semiosis whether of the word or the image Indeed the human is itself a prosthetic being who from day one is constituted as human by its coevolution with and coconstitution by external archival technologies of various kindsincluding language itself as the first ar chive and prosthesis As Wills puts it we have here in the insights of Derrida and Stiegler an investment in forms of exterior memory that will continue all the way to the computer revolution of the end of the twentieth century The upright hominid stance inscribes a definition of the human that is utterly determined by the idea of exteriorisation the hand reach ing outside the body to enter into a prosthetic relation with a tool the mouth producing or adopting the prosthetic device that is language As a result the archive is born the human species begins to develop a memory bank and its relation to time begins to be catalogued by means of the traces of an artificial memorythe artefact the narrative29 In other words there is no immediate presence From this vantage instead of what Wills calls the Promethean melancholy that the deadening or distancing effect of technology often elicits we might view it instead as a source of creationand not just from a Derridean point of view Indeed it is this distancing that makes possiblemakes unavoidablethe recursivity and folding that is key to the emergence of the virtual the movement that Derrida long ago dubbed the temporization and spacing endemic to the dynamics of the trace In this sense we would certainly agreeto lace together now the ideas of Derrida with those of Deleuzewith Brian Massumis assertion that nothing is more destructive for the thinking and imaging of the virtual than equating it with the digital30 Or more precisely the economy of the iterative trace which as Derrida puts it has to be extended to the entire field of the living or rather to the life death relation beyond the anthropological limits of spoken language31 would itself instance what Massumi imagines as a kind of encompass ing of the digital by analogic process in which what is coded is re cursivity    The digital processing becomes selfmodulating the run ning of the code induces qualitative transformation in its own loopy operation Against this background we can more fully appreciate the digital the analog and the spectr al Massumis observation that images of the virtual make the virtual appear not in their content or form but in fleeting in their sequencing or sampling The appearance of the virtual is in the twists and folds of formed content in the movement from one sample to another32 In a sense then the logic of the virtual is the logic of sampling itself a sam pling that is always leaving its source by the time it reaches us always in the process of vanishing This is directly related I think to the power of the voice and of the vocal tracks on My Life in the Bush of Ghosts As Stiegler the digital the analog and the spectr al conditionand it is in the end for Derrida both an ethical and political conditiondescribed by Roland Barthes in A Lovers Discourse It is characteristic of the voice to die What constitutes the voice is what within it lacerates me by dint of having to die as if it were once and never could be anything but a memory This phantom being of the voice is what is dying out it is that sonorous texture which disintegrates and disappears35 In short what makes the voice the voice is not that it is presence as the philosophical tradition tropes it according to Derrida but that it is spectral One might argue that the fact of the permanence of the recorded voice meets this objection but as we have already seen the recorded voice precisely in its repeatability and iterability only testifies all the more to the radical absence of every empirically deter minable subject to use Derridas phrase to the becomingghost of its origin in a bush of virtuality that its own ability to be sampled feeds and populates To put it another way My Life in the Bush of Ghosts abstracts the vocal material from its original anthropological religious or politi cal context but only the better to underscore its strangeness not an Orientalism or exoticism but a musicality and exteriority that exceeds intention denotation and sense confronting the listener with his or her own nonknowledge in the face of what Byrne called these trans missions from a desperate planet36 Hence the resistance of the voice in My Life in the Bush of Ghosts to the regime of rendering its gram maticalization and discretization is not provided by any kind of es sentialism or clinging to identity or origins Rather we would do well to recall Byrnes observation that at the time some people found this use of found vocal material disturbing and even repulsive because he wrote they would prefer to see music as an expression of emo tion    to believe in the artist as someone with something to say a queasiness connected with the idea of authenticity that as he the digital the analog and the spectr al immersed in similar work on the French Ocora label the idea was to make the record and try to pass it off anonymously as the genuine ar ticle And even though Byrne writes they eventually abandoned the imaginaryculturalartifact idea    I suspect this fantasy continued to guide us in a subconscious way37 All of that does not mean however nonserious In fact the po litical and ethical dimensions of that subconscious fantasy might be teased out by way of Richard Beardsworths observation that it is the lack of identity and ideality of any we of any community whatsoeverthe fact that strictly speaking we are irreducibly and inexhaustibly hetero geneous and different even to ourselves of course what else does the concept of the unconscious name in another theoretical vocabulary that will have returned from the beginning to haunt any determina tion of the community In this sense the weincluding the we of incipient globalization and its expression in digitalization that ani mates the ByrneEno project and its legion of voicemarks the ex cess of time over human organization38 It marks the subjection of any we to the alterity and radical otherness of time This lack of an essential identity is all the more apparent in contemporary society in which any country any locality determines its understanding of time place and community in relation to this process of global spectraliza tion 146a process that itself depends directly on the teletechnol gies and digitalization of memorysupport systems 147 that make it possible for such disparate communities to come into nonknowl edge of each other at an everaccelerating rate a process in which as Beardsworth puts it the real time of teletechnologies risks reducing the différance of time or the aporia of time to an experience of time that forgets time 148 And hereto cast a backward glance for a momentwe should remember once more Enos intense valuation of slowness and nonnarratological time in his video work As we saw at the end of chapter 3 what this means as Derrida ar gues is that in being spectralized by the mediumwhose maximum thematization is the alienating and distancing effect attributed to the digitalthe other comes first always first as he is fond of putting it This is why I am an inheritor the other comes before me39 The point here in other words is not just that the human is not reduc ible to its Pixarization via digital mass media whose aural equivalent the digital the analog and the spectr al would be that everyone would speak in the same synthesized voice The point is that what transcends that reduction and schematization is not a substance content presence or placenot in short an onto logical or anthropological authenticitybut rather a beyond as in Byrnes voices from another planet that is at the same time radically intimate a beyond that is not in Derridas terms a place In short the transcendent must be rethought as the virtual Such a line of argument would eventually lead us to Derridas sense of the messianic in relation to the spectral but therefore to a mes sianic without messianism without content or assurancein short to the livingon of a futurity to come without guarantees40 But it also leads us backor forwardto the odd temporal dislocation the asyn chronicity of the living present with itself remarked on by Eno in his reflections on his video piece Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan They evoke in me a sense of what could have been and hence gener ate a nostalgia for a different future It is as though I am extracting from this reality the one the camera is pointed at the seeds of another Video Paintings liner

Canguilhem for two of his hallmark ideas The first is the suspicion which Canguilhem himself had derived from Bachelard of sciences account of itself as a story of linear progression and thus the concomitant disposition to deal with the discontinuities evident in the history of science    The second is the inclination to explore history not in quest of a total dialectical comprehension but in terms of specific problematics within which there was determined for a specific field of study both the object of its reflection and the manner in which that reflection would be carried out We must think problematically rather than question and answer dialectically as Foucault puts it in Theatrum Philosophicum James W Bernauer Michel Foucaults Force of Flight Towards an Ethics for Thought

Made Flesh Embodying Information New York Routledge 2004 123 There they offer a useful reconceptualization of the concept of the body and counterpose it to four widespread understandings of the term the naturalist body the culturalsocial determinist body the animal body and the phe nomenological body 36 As they put it We propose that the body be understood as anything that cannot be divided without changing the fundamental pattern of its dynamics Thus bodies are made up of organs tissues cells and molecules but a description of a body cannot be reduced to a description of the parts or their functions This broad definition brings with it some surprising conclusions Machinic systems as popularized by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari may not be sets but they are bod ies An autopoietic system in the terms of Varela and Maturana is most definitely a body A selfreferential system in the terms outlined by Niklas Luhmann is a body A network as described by Manuel Castells is a body An organism bounded by flesh is a body    Moreover this understanding of the body allows us to distinguish between human and nonhuman bod ies without falling into the error diagnosed by HansUlrich Gumbrecht of employing a concept of the human that excludes    any reference to the human body 45 37 For a point of comparison here see Brian Massumis rather different Bergsoninflected sense of this point about the body and virtuality in Parables for the Virtual Movement Affect Sensation Durham NC Duke University Press 2002 3031 For Massumi presumably first doesnt mean both first
