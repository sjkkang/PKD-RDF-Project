Electric Sheep W HAT MAKES US HUMAN IS A QUESTION OFTEN RAISED IN and by science ﬁction and the postWorldWarTer minus postapocalyptic society of 2021 that protag onist Rick Deckard inhabits in P K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep seems both to raise and to answer it in espousing two speciﬁcyet ultimately mutually contradictorydeﬁnitions of human Numerous details of the novels setting and characteriza tions reveal that this societys very obsession with deﬁning human is undertaken in bad faith and consequently that its accepted legal istic ofﬁcial deﬁnitionsas their incompatibility suggestsare both false Yet the question thus raised through the ploy of explicitly pro viding highly suspect answers to it is legitimately addressed by the novels plot by the action and this more convincing but philosophi cally more challenging deﬁnition of human that arises implicitly from the story itself is instrumental to establishing the novels theme cisco Police Department and his society deﬁnes human primarily through the distinction it insists upon drawing between humans and the androids that are Deckards prey To be human is to possess empathy Even Garland an android masquerading as the senior ofﬁcial in a phony police department organized by the androids for their own protection acknowledges that we lack a speciﬁc talent you humans possess empathy a deﬁciency that Deckard later refers to as a deliberately builtin defect 99 108 162 Thus The Journal of Popular Culture Vol 46 No 6 2013  2014 Wiley Periodicals Inc VoigtKampff empathymeasuring test 26 And just as it is ironic and telling that humans in this society most commonly experience empathy through a machine the empathy box and use yet another machine the mood organ to avoid despair about total reality it is similarly ironic that Deckard gauges empathy by machine his testing apparatus moreover the test questions which elicit a physiological reaction to a number of social situa tions clearly reveal that the test really measures only a socially engendered culturespeciﬁc aversion to killing or harming animals this societys primary taboo rather than any truly universal innate and exclusiveand therefore deﬁnitivehuman quality 3 42 Human subjects are expected to exhibit a quantiﬁable shock or shame reaction to stimuli that would not in all but one or two instances elicit any such reaction from ordinary people in the real world or speciﬁcally from Dicks American contemporaries in 1968 mention of a calfskin wallet a butterﬂy collection including killing jar a bearskin rug boiled lobster a mounted deers head an abortion bullﬁght posters and eating raw oysters or boiled dog 4245 Elden Rosen claims that Rachel who is posing as a human scored as an android might on the test because she had spent most of her life on an failed space mission to Proxima Centauri and learned about Earth only from the ships tape library and what the nine other crew members knew that Deckard ﬁnds this false assertion plausible indicates in itself that his test measures a socially acquired response to stimuli not an innate human characteristic 46 Also after emphasizing that a valid deﬁnition must be exclusive in musing that empathy evidently existed only within the human community Deckard immediately invalidates this societal deﬁni tion concedes that empathy is not exclusively a human trait in speculating that empathy must be limited to herbivores or anyhow omnivores who could depart from a meat diet Because ulti mately the empathic gift blurred the boundaries between hunter and victim A herd animal such as man would acquire a higher survival factor through this because members of the herd would aid one another due to their mutual empathy but a solitary predator like an owl or a cobra would be destroyed 2627 This is a poor deﬁnition not only because it is not exclusive in that nonhuman herd animals such as dogs may exhibit empathy as well but also Faith and Bad Faith

distinct lack of empathy While he concludes that the humanoid robot constituted a solitary predator because it does not exhibit empathy Deckard himself is a solitary predator in that he has always worked alone in hunting androids 27 76 This irony is reinforced by John Isidores indis tinct impression of a bounty hunter as a machinelike thing without emotions that if killed got replaced immediately by another resembling it for this is a moreaccurate description of an android and is speciﬁcally like Isidores coetaneous momentary per ception of the android Roy Baty as a frame of metal a platform of pullies and circuits and batteries and turrets and gears 139 Moreover Deckard cannot empathize with his wife Irans desire for a moodorgan induced sixhour selfaccusatory depression which only makes him feel bitterly that she has nothing to give me 8283 Iran towards those who cannot afford one most people look down on you for not taking care of an animal they consider it immoral and antiempathic 10 People in general also look down on rather than empathize with specials those like Isidore who cannot pass the minimum mental faculties test because exposure to the omni present radioactive dust has degraded their intelligence and genetic integrity Like an android once pegged as special a citizen ceased in effect to be part of mankind and the governmentspon sored TV channel constantly informs Isidore in a countless proces sion of ways that he a special wasnt wanted that upon him the contempt of three planets descended 13 17 15 His boss Hanni bal Sloat calls Isidore a chickenhead a derogatory term for a less deteriorated special and cruelly forces him to make a telephone call that he is terriﬁed to make 69 Ironically echoing this human preju dice even the android he tries to befriend Pris sneers at chicken heads and at the suggestion that she live with a chickenhead Isidore even as her fellow android Irmgard Baty realizes intellectu ally that Isidore can empathize with androids precisely because humans dont treat him very well either 59 137 144 As those who cannot pass the minimum mental faculties test ceased in effect to be part of mankind this society likewise deﬁnes human secondarily through the distinction it also insists upon drawing between humans and specials To be human is to possess a minimum IQ Yet this deﬁnition too lacks the necessary quality of exclusivity because ironically the very androids Deckard is hunt ing the Nexus6 android types surpassed several classes of human specials in terms of intelligence no intelligence test would trap such an andy But then intelligence tests hadnt trapped an andy in years 2526 And Isidore while lacking the minimum IQ is the most empathicand for this reason also the most sympathetic and apparently humancharacter in the novel While the synthetic sufferings of false animals didnt bother Milt Borogrove or their boss Hannibal Sloat Isidore feels such empathy for the dying cat he transports to Sloats animal repair shop even though he believes it is not alive but electrical that what he thinks is merely the faked sound of a false animal burning out its drivetrain and power supply ties his stomach in knots 64 Isidore not only empathizes with the androids as well but is also terribly upset and then violently hysterical because Pris later cuts the legs off a spider he had

obviously human to the reader suggests that this societys secondary deﬁnition of human is false per se this in itself calls into question any other deﬁnition of humanity it might espouse including its primary deﬁnition And both deﬁnitions of human are called into question simultaneously in any case because they contradict one another in the person of Isi dore who exhibits more empathy the primary deﬁnition than any other character in the novel and yet cannot exhibit minimum mental faculties the secondary deﬁnition A close reading reveals not only that both deﬁnitions are false but also that both are similarly assumed in bad faiththrough this societys willful selfdeceptionprecisely to allow its members to claim as exclusively theirs those very qualities empathy and intelli gence that the historical fact of WWT demonstrates humanity does not possess in sufﬁcient abundance That is this society makes both specials and androids its scapegoats much as the dominant members of many real societies employ racism to make scapegoats of desig nated minorities via bad faith in order to deﬁne themselves as possessing only those positive traits they want to believe they embody through attributing exclusively to members of the desig nated outgroup to which they contrast themselves those opposite negative personality traits they want to deny the possibility of having in themselves And the analogy to this function of racism in real societies is explicitly suggested by the propaganda that Deckards societys government disseminates to motivate its citizens to emigrate to the offworld colonies To complement the radioactive fallout as stick the ultimate incentive of emigration is possession of an android servant as carrot and the promise that this social arrange ment duplicates the halcyon days of the preCivil War Southern states Either as body servants or tireless ﬁeld hands the customtai lored humanoid robot will be the emigrants loyal troublefree companion 1314 Both Deckard and Resch see in the androids everything we jointly abominate The essence of what were committed to destroy and see themselves as bounty hunters as standing between the Nexus6 and mankind a barrier which keeps the two distinct 111 124 The two must be kept distinct for basically the same reason that specials must be kept distinct from regulars in both cases precisely because the two are

progressively more human types an android that cant be distinguished from human Holden is in the hospital getting one of those new organic plastic spinal sections 47 166 23 And Iran realizes that using the mood organ is unhealthy that sensing the absence of life and not reacting used to be considered a sign of mental illness they called it absence of appropriate affect which is exactly what the VoigtKampff test measures while Pris attempts to conceal from Isidore that she is an android to explain away her lack of empathy by claiming to have escaped from a mental hospital Were all schizophrenic with defective emotional livesﬂattening of affect 3 141 Humans and androids are becoming so similar that perhaps the only thing that will always distinguish them is the one difference this entire society including the colonists really does in bad faith and thus tacitly want to maintain and can the deliberately builtin defect that excludes androids from experiencing the one trait humans want most to claim for themselves empathy 162 While Iran accuses him of being a murderer hired by the cops Deckard believes that in retiringie killing androids he is adher ing to the rule of life laid down by Mercer You shall kill only the killers an absolute evil but it was never clear who or what this evil presence was A Mercerite was free to locate the nebulous pres ence of The Killers wherever he saw ﬁt For Rick Deckard an escaped humanoid robot epitomized The Killers 1 27 And Deckard ﬁnally confesses to Iran that after retiring the last of the androids the Batys suddenly I didnt have anything to do That part was worse After I ﬁnished I couldnt stop because there would be nothing left after I stopped 214 In analyzing a personality type that has much in common with Deckardwho

which brought him daily so long as he failed to emigrate its little load of befouling ﬁlth the fact that like Deckard persons here and there declined to migrate constituted a perplexing irratio nality

ﬁnding the electronic toad he persuades himself is real a very difﬁcult twentyfour hours later Deckard muses that it has survived even that which were not really managing to survive and thus epitomizes the unacknowledged reality of life carefully buried up to its forehead in the carcass of a dead world 21011 Thinking that he too may have already used up his little time Deckard reﬂects that at some point ﬁnally the dust will have won 86 Yet humanity persists in its routine pointedly like Reschs squirrel which has a wheel in its cage It runs and runs the wheel spins but the squirrel stays in the same spot Reschs concession that Buffy seems to like it though prompts Deckard to observe in a dry commentary on the human condition in general and humanitys bad faith in particular I guess squirrels arent too bright 112 Mercerism and peer pressure require that everyone maintain an animal thus expiating their collective guilt overand symbolically redressingthe inexorable extinction

had bom barded Mercers brain with radioactive cobalt to prevent him from bringing dead animals back as they had been because the killerslike and symbolically those who had caused the fatal nuclear war and consequent extinctionsare collective humanity as well 12 27 20 Of course as Mercerism its empathybased and implicitly govern mentsponsored religion is integral to and inseparable from this soci etys badfaith effort to deﬁne human as possessing empathy it too is a locus of bad faith Mercers virtual passion in which anyone can participate via the empathy box is to climb a hill while being pelted with rocks to be killed at the top by the killers and plunged into a pit of corpses and dead bones the tomb world until the bones strewn around him grew back into living creatures and then to begin to ascend along with them until he found himself evidently climbing alone again in a neverending cycle of death and rebirth 2021 In addition to enacting this societys wishfulﬁllment fantasy of restoring extinct species this mythology and the fact that Mercer is always renewed rises inevi tably And us with him intimates that humanity is eternal too 67 Yet laying bare the psychological

did not exist There is no salvation do your task even though you know it is wrong It is the basic condition of life to be required to violate your own identity 156 The revelation of Mercerism is that

uphill a rock that always rolls back down Mercers cycle per se allusively unmasks the weary entropic futility of this postapocalyptic existence as it simultaneously offers hope of resurrection and

very nature because the implicit deﬁnition of human as com municated by the action of the novel is that humans are creatures who survive by believing in illusions 193 And the novels most unequivocal
