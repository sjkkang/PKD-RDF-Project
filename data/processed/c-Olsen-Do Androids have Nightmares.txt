Nine Lives Abstract This essay explores the contention that posthuman subjects such as androids clones and robots can experience psychological trauma The aim of the paper is to examine this notion in three science fiction texts Mary Shelleys Frankenstein Philip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Ursula K Le Guins short story Nine Lives What these narratives illustrate is that trauma manifestations can contribute to a disruption of ontological frameworks that maintain categories such as human and nonhuman as permanent and distinct As a result it might be argued that these texts undermine anthropocentrism and invite a reconceptualising around the term human but also around trauma conventionally understood as a primarily human experience Science fiction is thereby a signif icant genre when it comes to questioning anthropocentric perspectives Using posthuman theory and trauma studies this essay argues that these three texts portray their respective posthuman subjects as trauma victims and further that they demonstrate how the experience of trauma carries with it the potential to bridge the gap between human and posthuman through the act of bearing witness to one

30012025 162039 Electric Sheep Science Fiction Portrayals Introduction The term Anthropocene was popularised by Nobelwinning chemist Paul Crutzen around the turn of the millennium denoting what many scholars now consider the ap propriate name for our current geological epoch What defines the Anthropocene is how human activity has altered Earths climate and atmosphere to the extent that human kind must consider itself a direct geophysical force and an incontrovertible influence on the environment Crutzen 2002 23 If this is indeed the case the discovery of the Anthropocene should serve as the impetus to abandon the notion of human excep tionalism Humanities research literary studies included is required to take this into account Among the currently expanding fields within the study of literature is trau ma studies committed to exploring literary representations of psychological trauma Considering the implications of the Anthropocene however one might argue that the fields focus is highly anthropocentric This is perhaps not surprisingly also the case for most psychoanalytic criticism as we tend to think of the mind the unconscious and emotional intelligence as something uniquely and definingly human How can a robot for instance be capable of repressing traumatic memories This is hardly something we can imagine in todays technologies despite the rapid development of computers that are becoming increasingly mindlike However these are scenarios that science fiction texts have already been exploring for decades Scholars should therefore discard what Roger Luckhurst 2014 has described as a high cultural suspicion of SF which per haps has prevented science fiction texts from being fully explored in the past 5 and should devote more attention to the issues that scifi has raised and to how the genre can contribute to dissolving the foundations of anthropocentric perspectives A small amount of research has already examined the notion of posthuman trauma to a certain extent In his article Posthuman Wounds 2014 Tony M Vinci argues that the human characters of Philip K Dicks novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep 1968 practice a form of trauma deferment by using androids and animals as scapegoats and thus uphold an ontological framework that promotes human excep tionalism 93 Vinci also briefly speculates about the androids potential to experience trauma themselves what would it mean if the android could indeed be possessed by the traumatic event while also fully inhabiting the traumatic moment In other words what if the android were not only witnessing human events but experiencing its own trauma as well 2014 97 This is an intriguing question and one which will serve as the main focus of this essay Whereas Vincis article is primarily interested in human trauma this essay seeks to elaborate on posthuman trauma by examining various scifi narratives that feature traumatised posthuman subjects and to draw attention to the dif ferent ways in which these traumas manifest The essay aims to consider the Creature from Mary Shelleys Frankenstein 1818 the androids featured in Philip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Kaph the clone from Ursula K Le Guins short story Nine Lives 1969 By synthesising trauma studies with theories loosely centred around posthumanism the essay will show that the abovementioned texts Pobrane

able to experience trauma in different manners and that this contributes to a blurring of the boundaries between ma chines and humans thus undermining anthropocentrism Further one might argue that the texts also illustrate how trauma in the posthuman subject provides opportunities for humans to bear witness to the Others suffering and hence the experience of trauma establishes a platform for encounters where the humans fear of the posthuman Other transforms into understanding and compassion This is also the outcome when both human and posthuman are victims of trauma and are able to connect in their mutual experience as some of the texts show Trauma and Technology In the past trauma studies have been concerned with topics such as political conflict war violence terror and the Holocaust With regard to the relationship between trauma and technology one might argue that the latter has indirectly been regarded as contrib uting to psychological trauma although there is much potential in focusing more closely on the role of technology in trauma studies Indeed Roger Luckhurst 2005 has advo cated the necessity for more research incorporating science fiction texts into the field 5 Luckhurst in his tracing of the cultural history of science fiction asserts how technology has conventionally been regarded as a cause of psychological trauma 2005 27 Walter Benjamin for instance famously paints a picture of the modern urban experience where crowds cameras films and traffic cause the individual to experience a series of shocks and collisions Benjamin 2006 27 Modern technology has therefore been seen as in herently traumatic for the human individual and has been understood to cause trauma This is perhaps also apparent in Freuds famous railway accident example where he illustrates how accidents may lead to symptoms of trauma what causes the traumatis ing accident is the technology of the railway It may be suggested however that the development of technology has come so far that it might be time to reverse our thinking about the traumatechnology relationship An idea that may be considered is that instead of technology causing human trauma we are now the ones who traumatise technology What if technology in the form of computers and robots has evolved to the point where it possesses the ability to become traumatised This trajectory of thought is one that ought to be considered in an attempt to debunk anthropocentrism and to investigate and broaden the categories of trauma human and posthuman Upon closer inspection these scenarios are not as bizarre as they sound because the fact is that mindlike computers are already in the process of construction Robots and computers are now functioning with such complexity and sophistication that they are close to replicating human characteristics and abilities In his overview of the possibil ities of cognitive computing and cognitive systems Ahmed K Noor 2015 explains that these new computer systems are designed to work like the human brain or rather the human mind Deeper biological understanding of how the brain worked allowed Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Electric Sheep Science Fiction Portrayals scientists to build computer systems modelled after the mind and most importantly to build a computer that could integrate past experience into its system Noor states 76 Through developments in the incorporation of neural networks into computers researchers argue that the brain is a type of machine and can therefore potentially be replicated Noor 2015 76 The notion of technological adaptation of human abilities and mental properties has however been introduced decades earlier as illustrated by for instance the anthology Android Epistemology 1995 edited by Kenneth M Ford Clark N Glymour and Patrick J Hayes The anthology contains Herbert A Simons article Machine as Mind which presents the thesis that the acquisition of a mind is achievable for computers because the human brain is replicable the materials of thoughts are symbols  patterns which can be replicated in a great variety of materials including neurons and chips 1995 25 Simon further criticises sceptics of this idea for having a romanticised understanding of the human mind 1995 38 Both Simons and Noors work then demonstrate that posthuman intelligence is not located in the realm of distant future and that todays advancements in cognitive computers under score the necessity of reflection around these issues If computational machines are becoming intelligent and capable of storing memories then our notion of the psyche needs to be altered to include posthuman subjectivity As Noor points out trauma in computers robots and androids may soon become an actuality and we should there fore dismiss the thought of trauma as a uniquely human experience This is where literature and especially science fiction can provide valuable knowl edge Luckhurst 2014 has argued that the study of science fiction within a trauma stud ies framework can lead to significant insights into the trauma concept because the gen re dismantles any recognizable human subject in challenging ways  as imagined futures outgrow the psychodynamic frameworks that dominate conceptions of cultural trauma 159 However Luckhurst does not elaborate on how this expanded trauma theory where one incorporates posthuman subjectivity would be configured He points to texts such as Greg Egans Reasons to be Cheerful 1999 and Charles Stross novel Accelerando 2005 where subjectivity has been completely altered through capacities for simulation and direct neurological interference and Luckhurst argues that these vi sions challenge us to address the rapid development of new scientific understandings that are likely to reconceptualise notions of trauma in the very near future 2014 166 Although as Luckhurst states there is a necessity to reconceptualise trauma one might still argue that traditional trauma theory can serve as a beneficial angle from which to consider the posthuman subject as many of the discussions provided by for instance Freud and Cathy Caruth are still highly relevant in an encounter with science fiction Drawing on psychoanalysis poststructuralism and psychology literary trauma theory developed in the later decades of the twentieth century especially following the introduction of the PTSD diagnosis The field draws major inspiration from Freud one of the first philosophers to discuss trauma although he revised his opinion about the nature of the concept several times In Beyond the Pleasure Principle 1920 and Moses and Monotheism 1939 Freud debates symptoms such as the nightmares of Pobrane z czasopisma New

Caruth 1996 who is one of the leading trauma theorists today interprets Freuds definition of trauma as an event that  is experienced too soon too unexpectedly to be fully known and is therefore not available to consciousness until it imposes itself again repeatedly in the nightmares and repetitive actions of the survivor 4 Discussing the trauma of accidents Caruth argues that the accident does not simply represent the violence of a collision but also conveys the impact of its very incomprehensibility What returns to haunt the victim  is not only the reality of the violent event but also the reality of the way that its violence has not yet been fully known 1996 6 Trauma therefore revolves mainly around the individuals inability to comprehend or process the traumatising event This might have some interesting implications in light of artificial intelligence which like the human mind would be engaged in an act of processing Michelle Balaev 2008 similarly interprets trauma as becoming unrepresentable due to the inability of the brain understood as the carrier of coherent cognitive schemata to properly encode and process the event 151 The terminology here therefore suggests some evident links between the trauma experience and ma chine intelligence Typical symptoms of trauma have been listed by Luckhurst 2008 drawing on the official diagnostic manual from the American Psychiatric Association and include flashbacks nightmares avoidance of thoughts and feelings loss of temper control and hypervigilance 1 These are symptoms that we can identity in the post human trauma victims depicted in the texts this essay will be examining Monstrous Wounds Primal Trauma and Parental Rejection in Frankenstein Several critics have noted that Mary Shelleys Frankenstein may have been a manifes tation of the authors own traumatic experiences Mark A Rubenstein 1976 empha sises how the novel was influenced by Shelleys loss of her mother as well as the death of Shelleys child shortly after his birth These are aspects of trauma related to parent hood family and birth  significant themes that can contribute to an understanding of the traumas located in the novel In the backdrop of the novels horror trauma does indeed play a significant part Examining the Creatures psyche in light of trauma will reveal how the novel portrays a posthuman form of trauma while also advocating the need for this trauma to be acknowledged The majority of psychoanalytic readings such as Rubensteins and Sherwins 1981 have been devoted to examining Victors psyche when in reality the Creatures psyche is equally important for understanding the novel The Creature in Frankenstein has typically been attributed to the role of perpetrator murderer and antagonist and hence he is also known as the Monster Yet by allowing the Creature to express his grief and by giving voice to his version Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Electric Sheep Science Fiction Portrayals of the story the novel clearly invites sympathy for the Creature and implies that his monstrosity derives from Victors failure in his role as a parent The novel thus urges the reader to consider the Creature more as a victim rather than as perpetrator and considering Victors side of the story presents these categories as fluid and unstable There are several hints in the novel that the Creature does experience trauma and is capable of emotional reactions As we learn from Victors account the Creature is made from organic materials both human and animal and is somehow brought to life by Victor trying to infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing Shelley 2017 41 We can therefore assume that the Creature is humanoid though not entirely human The narrative reveals that he has highly developed cognitive abilities and that he ex periences strong emotions This becomes particularly evident in the novels ending scene where the Creature talks about his wounds Shelley 2017 87 which is the translation of the word trauma in Greek He appears traumatised speaking of his burning miseries and the agonies which consume him Shelley 2017 18687 If not directly showing symptoms of trauma the Creature certainly experiences strong emotions generated by the memories he has stored It might also be suggested that the Creature exhibits more empathy and emotions than humans in many instance as illustrated for example by his vegetarian diet my food is not that of man I do not de stroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment Shelley 2017 121 The Creature also experiences empathy towards other people through for instance his ability to observe the daily lives of the De Lacey family listen to their stories recognise their emotions and assist them As will also be the case with Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep empathy is one of the main symptoms of being human in Dicks novel The main source of the Creatures trauma one might argue is in fact his own birth  a traumatising experience that is reinforced by Victors immediate rejection Interest ingly this is reminiscent of what many psychoanalysts for instance Freud and Wilfred Bion theorise about birth in itself as a traumatic occurrence for the infant Whereas Freud explains primal trauma in terms of how the infant loses connection with the mother Wilfred Bion sees it as an inevitable part of birth because a baby is born with very limited ability to process its perinatal sense of impressions which it will inevita bly find overwhelming Crago 2016 12 Bions picture of primal trauma seems very similar to what the Creature experiences during the early moments of his life when he describes his first memories as confused and indistinct Shelley 2017 83 Further more he states a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me and I saw felt heard and smelt at the same time as if he cannot process what is happening Shelley 2017 83 The birth of the Creature is made increasingly traumatic by Victors abandonment of his creation and thus he prevents any form of contact or communication between the two from taking place Shortly after Victor has fled the scene of the birth the Creature comes into Victors bedroom obviously seeking contact with one hand  stretched out and muttering some inarticulate sounds Shelley 2017 4243 The Creature is therefore portrayed like a newborn overwhelmed by sense impressions Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Ida Marie Olsen New Horizons in English Studies  32018 The circumstances of the Creatures birth become the recurring trauma that continues to haunt him throughout the story as he struggles to comprehend Victors rejection am I not alone miserably alone You my creator abhor me Shelley 2017 81 Paul Sherwin has similarly discussed the Creatures experience of rejection and exclusion as catastrophic asserting that the Creatures utmost desire is that another reciprocate his need for sympathetic relationship and even after he becomes searingly conscious of his exclusion from the human community and be gins to objectify the negativity he arouses in others we recognize that his aggression is a byprod uct of disintegration not an innate drive that has been cathartically unbound 1981 890 The Creatures experience of his own exclusion therefore leads him to kill his vic tims It is evident that his aggressive actions can be traced back to his trauma Both Victor Frankenstein and Walton become witnesses to the Creatures trauma However they always seem to be in disbelief refusing to acknowledge it fully and to accept the Creatures humanity As will be shown at the end of this essay the act of bearing witness to anothers trauma is of major importance in Le Guins short story as the text demonstrates that human recognition of the posthumans ability to become traumatised can lead to successful encounters between human and humanoid In Frank enstein both Victor and Walton fail at this recognition Walton admits to feeling empathy for the Creature at first seeing him and hearing his side of the story when the two meet following Victors death I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery Walton states after having observed the Creature with a mixture of curiosity and compassion Shelley 2017 18485 But when Walton recalls Victors version of the tale his em phatic response changes into rage and indignation Shelley 2017 185 What Walton does not comprehend is that the Creature clearly suffers from some form of trauma and is desperate for the humans to acknowledge this However the humans narrow view of the psyche and their belief in human exceptionalism is too strong for this to happen and as a result the story becomes a tragedy for both Victor and the Creature a human and a posthuman Frankenstein thus becomes an important example of how much damage artificial intelligence can do if humans do not acknowledge the full extent of their exist ence their inner lives and their potential to store memories experiences and process these episodes In this way the novel makes a significant contribution to posthumanism particularly as it sheds light on the posthuman subjects ability to become traumatised Android Suffering Trauma as Catalyst for NonAnthropocentric Ontologies in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Philip K Dicks novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is concerned with the boundaries between human and posthuman perhaps to an even greater extent than Frankenstein In its attention to these borders trauma becomes a significant motif The Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Electric Sheep Science Fiction Portrayals novel depicts a postapocalyptic world where the majority of the human population has emigrated to Mars Humanoid androids have been created first as a form of wartechnol ogy socalled freedom fighters but now functioning as servants for humans who emi grate The job of protagonist Rick Deckard is to retire those androids who have escaped to Earth where their presence is illegal This is something he accomplishes through performing an empathy test on the androids as the only way to distinguish them from humans is to prove their alleged inability to empathise As the narrative progresses this distinction between human and android gradually falters Commenting on Dicks fiction in general Roger Luckhurst 2005 states that the protagonists find their locations in time and space subject to a bewildering disorder as the fabric of reality distends reveal ing a jerrybuilt artifice on the verge of collapse 107 Not only is this bewildering dis order a major ontological trauma for the human characters in Do Androids Dream but this is also the case for the androids In the universe of the novel humans are considered real and superior to the artificial androids in the same manner as real animals are seen as superior to electric ones As a result the androids are consistently confronted with so cial conventions which assert their artificiality as the characters we know to be androids continue to be reminded that they are not human even though everything that happens in the narrative suggests that the humanandroid dichotomy is false Furthermore as Tony Vinci points out if android trauma is considered a valid narrative of pain it will threaten to revise the distinction between real and artificial 2014 95 Since the novel indicates that android trauma is real this is one of the main ways in which Dick initiates a broad ening of the human concept and introduces posthuman trauma as a valid experience The novel demonstrates this posthuman trauma in several ways The most significant scene of android traumatisation is when Rachael a Nexus6 type android discovers Deckards plans to retire Pris an android who shares her physical features Rachael is clearly upset and distracted by Deckards revelation she had turned pale and her voice shook All at once she had become exceptionally unsteady Dick 1999 159 The scene demonstrates how Rachael feels empathy for Pris and possibly for the other androids as well something she confirms when Deckard suggests that she feels empathy Dick 1999 161 In spite of the fact that Rachael may simply be simulating her empathetic response the novel later implies that Rachael also has feelings and empathy for Deckard Indeed N Katherine Hayless interpretation of Rachaels character is that Rachaels strategy implies that she feels empathy for her fellow androids giving lie to the governments position that androids feel no loyalty to each other If she can care for her fel low androids we may wonder if she also cares for Deckard as she claims when she tells him that she loves him 173 In a manner highly reminiscent of the Creatures murders in Frankenstein Rachael proceeds to murder Deckards goat after he has ventured to retire the remaining an droids Rachaels unpredictable behaviour it may be suggested is symptomatic of her trauma Rachael is traumatised by Deckards ultimate belief in her artificiality which he Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Ida Marie Olsen New Horizons in English Studies  32018 particularly demonstrates in how abruptly he decides to kill her but changes his mind again Another contributing cause for Rachaels trauma could of course also be Deck ards retirement of her fellow androids which again underscores Rachaels empathy Regardless of Rachaels motives the act of murdering Deckards goat demonstrates Ra chaels posthuman trauma thereby both undermining the ontological framework that the Do Androids Dream society rests on and confirming the actuality of posthuman trauma The Strangeness of the Stranger Encountering the Other Through Trauma in Nine Lives Ursula K Le Guins short story Nine Lives depicts two humans stationed to work on a uranium mining project on the atmospherically hostile planet Libra As the story begins the men Pugh and Martin are joined by a crew of superhuman clones who ap pear to share an exceptionally close bond The expedition transforms into a traumatic experience for one of the clones Kaph when his nine siblings die in the impact of an earthquake What is interesting about this story is the trauma that Kaph clearly suffers from following this event It is evident that the episode manifests as a completely post human form of trauma because of the close connections that the clones share What is significant too is the way in which this posthuman trauma leads to an encounter and a mutual understanding between human and humanoid Le Guins story therefore highlights the importance of trauma as a mutual experience platform for a successful humanhumanoid confrontation and demonstrates that trauma can contribute to break ing down human perceptions of distinct boundaries between human and posthuman much like in Dicks novel This theme is also emphasised by Le Guins choice of set ting the stage where the trauma unfolds is itself portrayed as a traumatised place The opening of the narrative describes the planet Libra in the following manner she was alive inside but dead outside  Underneath in the black corridors the halls beneath the skin there were crepitations in darkness ferments chemical nightmares that went on for centuries Le Guin 2010 453 my italics This resonates with typical trauma symptoms such as nightmares and one wonders whether Le Guin intentionally draws on trauma as a theme in this story Like the Creature in Frankenstein and Rachael in Do Android Dream Kaph is traumatised His trauma arises from a distinct event the loss of his siblings in the un expected event of an earthquake This form of trauma which stems from a sudden and incomprehensible incident seems to correspond to Freuds understanding of accident trauma As previously mentioned Freud imagines a person surviving a train accident unharmed but with symptoms of trauma manifesting in the weeks after the accident He develops a series of grave physical and motor symptoms which one can ascribe only to his shock or whatever else happened at the time of the accident He has devel oped traumatic neurosis Freud writes 1939 119 Similarly Kaph is in shock but physically unharmed when Pugh and Martin discover him at the site of the earthquake Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies

subside he appears apathetic silent and staring into a dark ness that was not there Le Guin 2010 468 Pugh and Martin speculate on whether Kaph is experiencing the deaths of the nine other clones They were all of him he is all of them They died and now hes dying their deaths one by one they state Le Guin 2010 467 The full extent of Kaphs trauma begins to dawn on Pugh and Martin as they continue to observe him Additionally what is noticeable about the two men is that they are afraid of Kaph believing him to be unpredictable and capable of killing them This eerie situation echoes the uncanniness at the beginning of the story when the humans meet the clones for the first time Pugh and Martin are uncertain of what to make of the ten superhumans and their scepticism towards them strengthens the distinct categories of natural human and clone Kaphs unprocessed trauma like the Creatures trauma in Shelleys novel therefore poses a threat to the humans or at least this is what the humans believe and the story hints at the fact that the posthumans ability to experience trauma should be acknowledged and dealt with by humans What happens at the end of the short story however changes the mens rigid per ceptions of the human category and they become more attuned to and at ease with the posthuman This transformation takes place through Kaph and the men witnessing each others trauma Towards the close of the narrative both Pugh and Martin expe rience traumas of their own as Martin is caught in the centre of an earthquake and Pugh sets out to rescue him The situation causes Kaph to comprehend the two mens affection for one another The subsequent talk between Pugh and Kaph which serves as the storys ending scene clearly alters the situation for Kaph his face was changed as if he were glimpsing something he had not seen before his voice too was changed Le Guin 2010 475 What Kaph now sees is Owen Pugh the thing he had never seen before  the stranger who held his hand out in the dark Le Guin 2010 476 This scene can serve as an instance of how trauma can lead to an understanding with regard to the Other This is something Cathy Caruth also emphasises in Unclaimed Experi ence 1996 where she argues that ones own trauma is tied up with the trauma of another and that trauma may lead therefore to the encounter with another through the very possibility and surprise of listening to anothers wound 8 This one might argue is exactly what Nine Lives wishes to convey The strangeness of the stranger Le Guin 2010 455 particularly in a posthuman context becomes less strange when it is recognised that both human and posthuman may suffer from trauma and that this carries with it the potential for encounters and mutual understandings Conclusion To conclude the science fiction genre is invaluable in helping us abandon the an thropocentric worldview that has contributed to the advent of the Anthropocene As shown here one way that scifi texts achieve this is by illustrating that trauma is not Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Ida Marie Olsen New Horizons in English Studies  32018 a uniquely human experience but is also potentially experienceable by posthumans such as humanoid creatures androids and clones Mary Shelleys novel highlights the importance of human perceptibility to the needs and symptoms of a traumatized posthuman creation in order to prevent destructive behaviour from taking place Do Androids Dream also demonstrates how androids have the potential to become trauma victims although humans do not allow them to This in itself is traumatic for the an droids and in Rachaels character we clearly observe symptoms of humanlike trauma Finally Nine Lives is an example of how trauma can lead to reconciliation between human and posthuman or human and Other as theorized by Cathy Caruth Through shared trauma a successful encounter between Pugh Martin and Kaph ensues and the strangeness of the Other becomes familiarised and safe What these narratives have in common is their undermining of the rigid boundaries between human and nonhu man through the use of trauma as motif Ultimately all three narratives demonstrate that in a world of accelerating technological development humans cannot hold on to the myth of anthropocentrism but must accept the existence of the posthuman Electric
