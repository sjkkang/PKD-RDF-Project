Chapter 2 Passionately Posthuman From Feminist Disidentiﬁcations to Postdisciplinary and troubled I do not easily identify as a humanities scholar Instead I have come to position myself as a posthumanist and postconstructionist feminist scholar who belong to an international trans and postdisciplinary scholarly community of critical intellectuals with various kinds of afﬁliations to political movements which struggle for social and environmental justice  feminist queer transgender antiracist anticolonial antiableist environmental etc movements In academic terms I am professor of Interdisciplinary Gender Studies which I deﬁne as a post disciplinary discipline as elaborately reﬂected in earlier work Lykke 2010 2011 version of postdisciplinary posthumanities I will ﬁrst present my ambivalent position of belonging as well as not belonging to the humanities Alongside of my argument I shall also suggest that the huma nities can be considered as an imagined community that makes certain identity poli tical claims and discuss my position as one of disidentiﬁcation Secondly I shall discuss the humanities iconographic centrepiece the Universal Human and how my feminist disidentiﬁcation with this icon prompts me to take other directions towards the investigation of posthuman subjectivities Thirdly I will discuss current transformations of the humanities These transformations are on the one hand obviously prompted by neoliberalist quests for commodiﬁcation and demands that humanist research show utilitarist use value On the other hand they are also gener

other animals historically materially and culturally And more speciﬁcally how can we under stand such relations in feminist terms Animals play crucial roles in human lives we use them for food clothing medical research entertainment education recrea tion Moreover we mirror ourselves in other animals in them we see similarity and difference and thus also our own superiority The complex shifting and often contradictory relationships between us and other species are the focus of a growing area of academic inquiry known as humananimal studies HAS here we draw on this research to consider what a focus on humananimal relations brings to feminist theory Both feminism and animal politics have concerns with questions of power albeit in different ways how then can they inﬂuence each other As feminist theory has expanded its remit and embraced diversity it has chal lenged the position of humanity as the center of all life on earth and come to recognize the interconnected exploitations of different humans as well as other animals nature and terra at large Here we will outline three areas that in our view connect feminism and animal studies and raise questions for both These are identity politics embodiment and accountability  including the related ques tion of rights There are of course other areas that could possibly be explored affect voicing control etc What we want to do is to point out a few fruitful inter connections Through exploring these connections and disconnections between the L Birke Dept Biological Science University of Chester Parkgate Rd Chester

Braidotti eds A Feminist Companion to the Posthumanities httpsdoiorg1010079783319621401_10 interdisciplinary ﬁelds of feminist and humananimal studies we argue for an inter sectionality which includes species Like feminist studies HAS involves multidisciplinary inquiry What HAS brings is a speciﬁc focus on animals and humans in relation it takes nonhuman animals seriously as subjects who engage or not with humans in multiple ways Such mutual embodied communication is crucial to our relationships with what Haraway 2003 2008 calls companion species Using the example of humandog relations she emphasizes our mutual embeddedness in histories of shared engage ments and calls for a relational ethics We humans relate to dogs in multiple and intersecting ways not only through onetoone friendships with particular dogs but also through enfolding with them at many levels in networks of connections from breeders and pet food manufacturers to park wardens Bringing animals into focus as social actors raises many issues for humanities social science and politics  all of which have traditionally excluded them This exclusion has been true also for feminism Yet although the trajectories of femin ist concerns and humananimal studies have been different and there is sometimes tension between them we believe that there is a strong kinship and a theoretical base for understanding interspecies relationships in feminist terms This can entail multiple spaces and scales from global to interpersonal levels in institutions or organizations from historical to contemporary or even future concerns Humananimal relationships are profoundly connected to other oppressions including sexism Cudworth 2011 Connections between gender and animality have been explored by several ecofeminist writers eg Adams 1990 Gaard 2011 who have pointed to the ways that both women and animals become subordinated Alongside that work there has also been resistance to naturalizing ideologies espe cially those that imply linkages between animality and women Relatedly the sex gender distinction has contributed to the disconnections with animal theory Holmberg 2008 46 Animals like sex were seen as ﬁrmly belonging to nature But that division has been challenged in many ways from acknowledgement of the cultures of for example laboratory animals Birke 2003 Holmberg 2011 to Haraways insistence on the entwinement of naturecultures Haraway 2008 to Haywards recognition of crossspecies perception in encounters with marine life Hayward 2010 Hayward and AhKing this volume There is now more recognition that human exceptionalism is itself a socially constituted order  a naturalized ideol ogy  which can be understood as maintaining speciﬁc social norms Yet there are limitations to this work Deckha 2012 for example argues that feminist interven tions around species have made insufﬁcient impact on animal activism and ethics and have not been sufﬁciently intersectional sometimes excluding race and culture Here intersectionality may provide a promising feminist posthumanist approach to humananimal relations taking account of various forms of naturalized social orders Feminist theories of intersectionality offer ways to explore complex relations of gender race class and sexuality They are not however unproblematic Lykke 2005 McWeeny 2014  not least because they generally disregard nonhu mans and rarely consider how human power is materially constituted through animal bodies It is precisely these considerations that HAS can contribute to feminist L Birke and T Holmberg inquiry How can we consider the interaction of multiple identities and experiences of exclusion and subordination Davis 2008 67 if we take species into account How good are our theories at recognizing our situation as one species among many This is a considerable challenge as feminism has dealt little with species diversity or explored how exploitation of nonhumans crosscuts and coconstitutes other systems of oppression Such questions can greatly enrich feminist thinking We can view human animal relationships as intersectional and performative such that species intersects with genderclassrace and other structures of power see Cudworth 2011 Human animal relationships can be seen as performed and animaled Birke Bryld and Lykke 2004 they are intersectional rather than analogical meaning that different axes of power relations intersect transforming practices and discourses In what follows we explore three areas in which feminist and animal studies share common ground in order to highlight intersectional connections Identity Politics Pivotal to understanding humananimal relations as intersectional is to understand species as kin in itself as relational Charles 2014 Many of us live in multispe cies households raising questions about how sociality is constituted and how categories are negotiated Our relationships with animal companions are more over freighted with ideas of gender and identity for example with horses Birke and Brandt 2009 Here we focus on one example where gender intersects with ideas of animality and family around women and cats The phrase cat lady  title of a Canadian documentary 2008  can invoke a lascivious feline image or it can imply someone who lives with many cats The latter is often seen as lonely ill or crazy with a void ﬁlled by cats Two contrast ing womancat relationships emerge in the documentary One is epitomized by Margot who returns home from work to her three cats Her apartment features cat portraits and show rosettes and thus portrays her through her interspecies relation ship The cats appear wellgroomed content Margot arrives and talks to them so that they appear as her valued family But only up to a point Speaking of her lack of human friends she says sadly a lot of people dont know that I am as lonely as I am Cat Ladies 2008 For her loneliness cats are inadequate substitutes The second example is epitomized by Diane and her 132 cats They live unsur prisingly in chaos some in cages but many running around behind furniture or under beds Diane too moves constantly feeding cleaning giving medications Recognizing that it has got out of hand Diane says she must stop helping the cats and start thinking of herself she appears to have lost control of her life and the cats now control her Like other cat hoarders she is unable to care for her animals  or herself Here there are not only intersections of humannessfemininity and animalityfelinity but representations are also intersected with age social class and place for extended discussion see Holmberg 2015 Intersections The Animal Question Meets Feminist Theory The ﬁlm exploits several interspecies intersectional identity markers Diane is stressed rushing around like her cats but she is also portrayed as a victim of circumstances Gender and class interact with this animaling process so that Diane becomes a helpless woman in relation to the cats who take over Margot in contrast appears as an inadequate woman who mothers cats instead of children Moreover the place called home looks very different in these two stories Margots apartment seems feminine intersecting with her cat mothering identity while Dianes chaotic house is dominated by the lives of the cats producing a troublesome identity  a woman without a home yet not homeless When these cat ladies appear as home bound irrational and out of control they seem to lose something of their human status And if they lose humanness because of their lack of conspeciﬁc relationships the cats lose their petness Hissing cats in cages conﬂict with ideas of domesticated docile pussycats But even the human made babied cat breaks with the ideal image of the pet The examples clearly show that pet categories as well as human ones are contingent positions  their boundaries can be moved and renegotiated Holmberg 2015 Redmalm 2013 The cats in these stories emerge as both victims and abusers as well as sentient agents Feminist analyses of these embodied power relationships might question linkages between gender and sentimentality evident in these narratives From a HAS perspective we might add that representations of cats as frivolous deceitful or magical on the one hand and mothering and homely on the other  intersect with historical split identities of the feminine as sexually uncontrollablevirtuous mother The category of human is ideologically historically and practically contingent on separation from yet dependent upon nonhumanity Similarly the category of animal is multiple and gendered Representations structure and are structured by normative narratives about humans animals nature and society Haraway points out that narratives should be understood in terms of their materialsemiotic presences and effects 2008 in constructing an identity of animal we produce human exceptiona lism It is ironic that as feminist theory has strongly emphasised difference it has so easily reproduced the animal other as a singularity And this is a political move As Peggs 2012 argues human is a political identity precisely when it is mobilized in opposition to the interests of other animals However as the brief example on cat ladies above is intended to highlight identities are multiple and ﬂuent Intersectionality in our view must include a broader critical approach to modernity puriﬁcation taxo nomies and identity politics and aim at providing alternative subversive performances Thus there is a pressing need to extend our theorizing to take seriously multiple subjectivities whoever they are and morethanhuman dynamics and embodiments Embodiment  Intercorporeality Embodiment has long mattered to feminist theorizing In HAS too scholars have sought to understand how corporeality and affect impact upon interspecies com munication eg Acampora 2006 Donovan 2007 Both have invoked the idea of L Birke and T Holmberg intercorporeality to reference how bodies can affect one another in many con texts Between species this might for example include the incorporation of one body into another through food consumption Buller 2012 it might include the myriad relations implied by companion species Haraway 2008 or Haywards 2008 description of the impressions of cup corals and scientists It can also encompass close tactile onetoone physical activities such as horse riding Birke and Hockenhull 2015 Smith 2011 These diverse contexts convey the profound embodiment of social relations whether with people or other animals communicating especially with nonverbal others young children nonhuman animals means using the body becoming intercorporeal  what Smart 2011 refers to as bodily ways of knowing enacted through the body It is precisely those embodied ways of knowing that matter for our engagement with nonhuman animals they can mediate interspecies communi cation as well as making power explicit through the body and its comportment cf Butler 19931 In perceiving others actions we engage with them to become within these social encounters is also to become a body and to make oneself available to the becomings of others whoever they are and whatever their perceptual skills2 This entails not only reading and understanding bodies across species lines but also movingaffecting other bodies and allowing oneself to be movedaffected in turn Despret 2004 The resulting multisensory dialogue is evident when we watch humans and dogs interacting eg Sanders 1999 Irvine 2004 Higgin 2012 in his study of guide dogs and their people actions of human and nonhuman are not forced but coproduced3 Even when the person walks alongside movements may be coordinated Birke and Hockenhull 2015  a kind of bodily meshing in which horse and person pay attention and work together There is a mutual entwining here reﬂecting neuromuscular patterns as well as mutual affect Agents are not bounded individuals in this view but spill over into others experiences directly affecting each other Stuart 2013 314 speaks of a union between two nervous systems implicit in ways that teachers of postural techniques work with clients in coactivity She emphasizes bodily mutuality depending upon interindividual physiological resonances In the intercorporeality of humananimal relationships there is similarly a dialogical relation a neuromus cular dynamical ﬂow Although multisensory it is particularly affected and effected by touch The shared balletic ﬂows of horse and rider in dressage for example emerge from tactile sensations shared histories and understandings as well as physiological capabilities see Lagarde et al 2005 Although intercorpore ality is emphasized even eulogized in both HAS and feminist writing its mean ing often remains nebulous If horse and human or person and dog are moving together there are profound material changes going on biological ﬂows which both produce and are produced by the encounter and which transcend the indivi dual bodies there might for instance be echoing changes in nervous system func tion immune responses or hormone release4 Despite earlier fears about essentialism feminist theorists are now much more willing to engage with biology to refuse to put it into boxes and to think of the body as highly permeable and plastic Frost 2010 Shildrick 2010 These diverse insights could open up interesting ideas for HAS particularly for those of us whose focus is close interspecies encounters What precisely does it mean when riders speak of feel for the horse in terms of bodily experiencing through mus cles nerves sinews Certainly animals often readily pick up nonverbal and unin tentional cues from human bodies horses for instance increase their heart rate if the human handlers heart rate goes up Slight changes in human muscle tension are easily apparent to the animal even if all that links them is a lead rope Feminist theory around embodiment with its growing willingness to think across divides can offer insights into humananimal relationships as intercorporeal So too can animals contribute to feminist thinking First for example the exquisite sensitivity of many nonhumans to our actions even before we do them underscores the importance of nonverbal bodily ways of knowing which produce coactions Such crossspecies mutuality challenges individual human cognition and rational 3We acknowledge here that there is some degree of domination in that animals have fewer choices and are located ﬁrmly within a sociocultural framework in which animals are indeed dominated and abused Nevertheless there are possibilities sometimes for companion animals to experience pleasure in relatings with us see Cudworth 2011  and perhaps even to enjoy shared activities 4The hormone oxytocin for example often called the bonding hormone is released by both dog and person when they gaze at each other Nagasawa et al 2015 L Birke and T Holmberg language as the bases for sociality Secondly thinking about nonhuman animal embodiment challenges intersectionality as McWeeny 2014 emphasized Debates about intersectionality she argues can lose sight of speciﬁc bodily experiences harms She draws on ideas from ecofeminism and the colonialgender system to argue that our bodies are related to that of others through lines of intercorporeal relations that collectively form topographies of ﬂesh ibid 269 For McWeeny these lines of intercorporeality include nonhumans whose bodies experiences and oppressions are as fully implicated as those of humans In addition HAS scholars have shown how humans too have the ability to sense the wellbeing of other animals through their bodily demeanor Wemelsfelder 2012 These intercorporeal sensations are of course embedded in webs of power  For exam ple returning to the cat ladies above the interplay of knowing and sensing works in relation to the phenomenon of cat and dog hoarding assessment through sensuous governance Holmberg 2014 reinforcing hegemonic norms of proper living and humananimal relations based on sensually constructed knowledge This term refers to the ways in which experts use sensing through seeing hearing feeling and snifﬁng as a means of knowledge and as a method of management knowledge senses and power go hand in hand However animals play important roles in the governance of hoarding In the hoarding context cats and dogs also perform certain feralness most often refusing to collaborate with authorities Ideas about intercorporeality and inter species impressions can thus contribute to intersectionality  especially when interspe cies encounters are taken into account Various human and animal bodies  in this particular case cats human authorities of different kinds and socalled hoarders  interact and produce knowledge about the situation As in the case of humanhorse relations above intercorporeality is produced in between human and nonhuman actors albeit within different degrees of freedom between intersecting axes of power Power and Responsibility How can we understand power relations as both producing and constraining issues of life and death If nonhuman animals are crucially part of social life then there are moral implications To what extent can they be accorded rights even citizen ship Discourses of animal rights are problematic ﬁrst they are based on negative rights rather than saying anything about positive relational duties see Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011 Second from feminist perspectives Braidotti 2008 106 Responsibility Haraway points out builds on response Such a capacity can be shared only in and for multidirectional relationships in which always more than one responsive coactor is in the process of becoming That means that human beings are not uniquely obligated to and gifted with responsibility animals as workers in labs animals in all their worlds are responseable in the same sense that people are that is responsibility is a relationship crafted in intraaction through which entities subjects and objects come into being Haraway 2008 71 Humans and other animals are thus responseable meaning that since they have capacities to respond they also need to be responsible Although Haraways terminology might suggest that relations are non hierarchical she acknowledges that they are embedded in power see Cudworths 2011 critique of Haraway and that interests will always conﬂict Taking this stand point seriously it means that humans in general have a greater responseability for humanimal relations Having responsibilityresponseability implies an ethic of care For example Donovan and Adams write that attention is a key term when it comes to a feminist ethics of care including attention to the political and economic sys tems that are causing the suffering Donovan and Adams 2007 3 Systems that cause suffering include meat production thus they argue for vegan feminism Unlike Haraways demand for responsible practices they  as many other feminists writing about animals  see food production as inherently violent eg Adams 1990 Curtin 2007 Donovan 2007 Food practices they argue must be seen as part of a feminist ethics for these authors responsibility means avoiding using animals for food alto gether Relatedly having responsibility implies political and social obligations Animals in general may not be able to resist their oppression collectively though some do individually with varying success It has been argued that nonhuman animals fruitfully can be viewed as cocitizens Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011 as members of a shared social life eg companion animals or whose sovereignty should be respected animals in the wild To think about other species as part of our collective social lives is to think intersectionally5 HAS like feminism has roots in political activism Whatever position one takes in relation to animal politics there is a principle behind it of trying to organize politically on behalf of animals  of trying to do something for animals  which matters To have an ethics of care to be responsible also means being accountable  in academic terms that includes accountability to the subjects of our inquiries This issue has been much discussed among feminist scholars debating how to do respon sible research that is accountable to the people studied Skeggs 2001 Accountable research feminists usually argued was research that rejected objectivist assumptions that researchers could stand apart from their subjects It was furthermore research which involved the subjects at different stages as well as involving the researcher in the communities being investigated 5However this perspective could be accused of speaking to the same liberal ontology that we argued against above What would a politics that can take collectives into account look like see Holmberg 2015 L Birke and T Holmberg There is an ethics of care implicit in these feminist debates about accountability which could usefully inform HAS see Birke 2009 However much we study humananimal relationships we might also ask whats in it for animals To think about that question is not only to ponder what they might think about it but also to consider whether our investigations can help to bring about change  in the ways we think about them and their abilities in the ways we treat them in the ways we respect  or not  the places they live Accountability is not easy and there are inevitably imbalances of power  whether those studied are human or not In this context it is important to remember Spivaks 2006 theorizing on the subaltern and the voices that they are being denied Shouldcould we ever speak for them Nevertheless we would argue that accountability is an important issue that animal studies scholars can usefully glean from feminism see Birke 2009 It is moreover also the question of account ability to others including nonhuman others that continues to provide a signiﬁcant challenge to feminist scholarship we would argue It is not enough to talk about how our lives connect with those of other species if we remain oblivious to the poli tics of such relationships  essentially one of exploitation This would simply be an intellectual exercise leaving our theorizing unaccountable We need of course to keep in mind that although our relations with other species are primarily exploitative embedded in myriad layers of domination there may also be affection and love within speciﬁc relations  as many of us who share our lives with companion species would attest see Cudworth 2011 And to complicate the picture further feminist thinkers have taught us that love and care does not exclude power relations On the contrary caring relations are by deﬁnition asymmetric although not always in ways we can predict Conclusion Humananimal studies and posthumanist feminism have many in our view under explored intersecting points of interest Power relations naturalized ideological and capitalist systems as well as more cultural and symbolic dimensions bring the two areas together Despite this while gender and feminism have had at least some impact on the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of animal studies the role of other animals in feminist theory has been a rather invisible one What HAS largely recognizes is the sentience agency and cultures of nonhuman animals Abilities to feel and suffer or to work and play together  to thrive matter Haraway 2008 In Haraways view part of that lesson is to stop thinking about humans and animals as culture and nature as us and them and to start considering all rela tions as intersectional 2008 18 Species race and gender are relational rather than analogous Women for example are not treated like animals in porno graphy and trafﬁcking similarly industrial meat production systems including abattoirs are not like Nazi concentration camps These and other profoundly troubling phenomena must be analyzed in their own context otherwise we will Intersections The Animal Question Meets Feminist Theory contribute to the downgrading of other animals and as a paradoxical consequence of downgrading humans while losing some essential insights into humanimal becomings in that speciﬁcities may be lost This is why debates about intersectiona lity need to take into account all those who can feel or engage with others whatever their gender race  or species These other sentient creatures coproduce sociality and culture alongside us Bekoff 2002 and we should properly recognize that mutuality in our politics and consider its implications6 If we emphasize intersectionality in posthumanities research and feminist post humanist theorizing and seek to understand the multiple and complex ways that power structures cut across or complement each other then we must recognize where other species are situated in those power structures This is where insights from HAS scholarship can help to inform feminist inquiry not only does HAS work to trace the complex ways in which nonhuman lives are entwined with human ones but its activist connections remind us of the politics Nonhuman animals in our technoindustrial world are increasingly commodiﬁed and disem powered Similarly certain categories of humans are dehumanized and disempow ered The anthropological machine that produces the contingent boundaries surrounding the category of the human Agamben 2004 works in both ways Indeed it is precisely for this reason that we are wary of some versions of posthu manist scholarship whatever the philosophical promises posthumanist theorizing risks overemphasizing the political potentials of transgressing bodily boundaries through for example biotechnology without reﬂecting on the patterns which allows some bodily boundaries to become transgressed without consent This is where feminist theorizing is crucial keeping a critical eye on the multiple power relations producing knowledge bodies and cultural representations in certain directions and not others It is equally important that feminists engage with emerging debates about the cognition sentience and emotions of other animals Bekoff 2002 as is currently being done in other ﬁelds within new material feminism see Braidotti 2008 Shildrick 2010 Alaimo this volume Hird this volume To ignore nonhuman animals or to allocate them to an unchanging nature is to engage through natura lizing ideologies as acultural or even asocial and that is a political move serving to reinforce human domination It is not compassionate nor subversive And nor can politics which excludes power relations regarding species be called a feminist politics We have a strong conviction  and hope  that we will see more of human animal relations in feminist research with the current posthumanist and materialist turn 6There is growing recognition of animal sentience in legislative systems  European legislation for example acknowledges animal sentience But there are also increasing demands for at least some species to be accorded rights broadly analogous to human rights great apes for instance For further discussion of the issue of animals and citizenship see Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011 L Birke and T Holmberg
