at the leart of cyberspace is the belief in the mathematical structure of nature in the computability of the universe 488 I will add to that statement that we are faced with a concept of

and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism in short we are cyborgs The cyborg is our ontology   The cyborg is a conde11Sed image of both imagination and material reality Haraway I 50 emphasis added Machines have always been fascinating from the eighteenth to the twentieth century they have changed our relationmediation with the world From the Cartesian model with the automata to the postmodern model of cyborg machines have been an ideal model to explain nature and ourselves theorized and fabricated  What does really make human diffeqnt from tnachine  And after all do we really want to be different The relationship between machine and human seems to be more complex it is underlinedbya faschiation a de gree oferotic pleasure a seductionoftheother a sense of selfrecognition and to a certain extent as Baudrillards concept of seduction an intriguing mirror effecPimagination and material reality Needless tomention thenthat in this complex erotic relation through the mirror effect another mirror stage comes out itis a new cortfigurationofour own s1bjectivity we are cyborgs In fact if we confer to machines the same characteristic as we have subjectivity in return this concept of subjectivity functions as a double arrow and needs to be redefined through the machine influence the cyborg is our outology Data in Star Trek claims that he is more than a machine heis au android He admires human society and desires to behuman In the episode The Measure of the Man Data is on trial Whatis at stakeis whether Data is a machine then a property of Starfleet or a subject with the right tochooseto be dismantled and analyzed Captain Picarcl defends Data vehemently on the basis that I heis an intelligent being 2 he is selfaware and 3 he values friendship and his past intimate relationship with a crew member The trial is in facta matter of metaphysics and Picard ends it by raising the question of what is really Data However it is not clear anymore whosedesiteto be h11man itisthemachines Data or the humans Picard In my view science fiction films dealing with confrontation of machinehuman display an iinterface a constructed space a sort of dreamspace where desires meet The machine is not a11 if to be anic mated worshipped and dominated The machine is us our processes an aspect of our embodiment  We are responsible for boundaries we are they Haraway 180 Machines have always been in the shadow of humans as a cherished dream haunting the human unconscious This is an unconfessed desire the repressed that will always at the end challenge our sense of security our certitude of ontology Indeed machines disturb the roots of our reality and subjectivity We think we know what we are where we stand in the tableau ofnature4 we know our ancestors in the

Department of English Cyborg as ProblematicBignifier organisms but it seems that alive does not mean whatit did in a previous episteme First of all being alive was equated with being an orgfUism In the eighteenth century the goal of natural history was mainly fodassify Life was known butnotquestionedin comparison to inorganic matter Lifewas taken  for granted as a type of attribute in some objects there were beings as Pou cault says in The Order of Things but life was not a category standing outside of the inorganic world 9f the tableau of nature NaturaLhistory was a field under the general study of physicsThemanmachine paradigm meant to unify all beings undef absolute rules given by God Unity was a rule unqÂµestioned and we look at similarity of structures among beings to classify them It was the realm of visible structures as Fran9ois Jacob explains it in The LogicoJLife However in the nineteenth century with the comparative aI1atomyCuvier and other disciplines emerging life became diff erenciated from inorganic matter and alive beingf took a new position in the tableau of nature Unityno longer dictates the rules of classifjcation and discontinuity was at the basis of classification 5 It was the ri8e of experimentation aI1d 4life had properties Organic was thus differenciated from inorganic and organislll was assqdated with 1ifeOrganization became the principle defining life the difference be tween organic and inorganic matter being the specialarrangentent of elements in matter Life was thus defined through a vital force coming from orgat1i zation Butthis vital principle is not clear in the nineteenthcentury sdentific debate 1 can infer two directions important for my discussion on the living and that set apart grosso modo two philosophical trends the vitaIist and the materialist 1 life coming from the special arrangementof elements is like a spontaneous force in itself coming from withinmaterialist 2 life is a force insuffiated to matter as an outside factor given by GodNature  vital ist Claude Bernard the French physiqlogist held strongly to the idea oforga nization and even if he could not explain it further he was close to what the first half of twentieth century came up with  Another aspect of life was the teleological condition the final cases life has agoal organic matter is work ing in that direction Qrganization leads toward a goal  Determinism came out as a philosophy Finally another aspect characteristic to this century of man organism isthat life comesfromlife itis a matterofreptoductionaninot of Spontaneous generation heredity being the key In the tableau of nature similarityanalogy also dictates thedassification of objects but itis a s1mi1ty of the function not of the structure of organs Branchia in fishes issimilar to lung in a1iimals because the two organs share the Junction pf respiration It is a similarity of invisible structures The transition between tlle paradigm manmachine and manorgmism is of course more compkxand not that clearcut But I want here togive a general idea of what characterizes the nineteenth century asthe century of the sciences of life and the livingJrom

discourses The cyborg is in fact a representation of anew culturalpower a powerful position in discourse that allows new identity politics and social space as Haraway ex plains in her chapter A Cyborg Manifesto Science Tephnology and Socialist Copyright 2011 ProOuest LLC All rights reserved Copyright University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College Department of English Cyborg as Problematic Signifier Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century As a parallel then looking at litera ture of the nineteenth century even if the concept of cyborg did not exist we can still find some comparable figures of the thorization f manmachine and manorganismthe monster in Frankenstein Dracula  either dead or alive and the representationofhuman in Zolasle Docteur Pascal In other words these monsters from the past could come back in our postmodern culture and claim their new identity and rights as cyborgs and not just as the other And this is a big difference between cyborg and other The cyborg as Haraway keeps defining it is the postmodern constructthat transgresses challenges and subverts traditional dichotomies that ensured se curity control and domination over natureculture malefemale mjndbody naturalartificial machineorganism humannonhuman etcThe cyborg refuses unity odgin and stability it does not trust the Father and breaks definitely with the Mother It is an antiOedipus it is an illegitimate offspring refusingthe Fathers systemthat has to question also the Mother since the latter is part of the system the cyborg tries to destabilize The cyborgs position is that of the other fighting the system from within and as such it is frightening The cyborgs discourse is that of difference its politics of transgressionsubversion ani its social identity gives it no roots It is more than an illegitimate offspring it is an orphean beingitsown origin and its own end Haraway gives an interesting list correspondingtothe cyborg world inwhich dichotomies may be

there Copyright 2011 ProQuest LLC All rights reserved Copyright University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College Department of English Cyborg as Problematic Signifier is discontinuity in space and continuity intime My argument isthat the cyborg standing for living points at subjectivity that as a concept is relying on the Cartesian and Newtonian epistemology and as such it shows a crisis This oh jectified subjectivity then has tobe questioned Thns since the cyborg destabilizes our sense of ontology andjdentity some thing has happenedin the tableau ofnature and made a change from What are we to Who are we It is a shift from the structural levelmacbine and organ ism as informationprocessingsystemsto the functional levelma9bine and organism havingasubjectivity ln short  this shift mirrors that one between the eighteenth and nineteenth century  The salient point here inmyargmnent is that similarityanalogy as a mode of thinking is still central inthe tableau of nature and in this postmodern era similarity appears through the disguiSyd form of the metaphor of the cyborg At the riskto boldly go where no one has gone be fore I would say that metaphor making the relations between objects in the tableau of natnre is precisely what creates the crisis in lhe postmodern con struct of the cyborg in the epistemological frame ofthe living The wetaphor allowsus to

could add one more Who am I discursively In othetwords what makes the boundary between humans and machines is the question ofsubjec tivity through the cyborg   we still do not know how to define conscious ness The first robot that turns to its creator to declare that it is conscious will cause a great deal of confusion for selfconsciousness has no definition that can be applied to and verified in others But dowe at least know how to define life Lestienne 143 The representation of the living in both Star Trek and Blade Runneris a matter of subjectivity a concept caught in anthropomorphism To equate life with subjectivity is to go back before a Copernicianrevolution and put humans at the center of the world I would say with Haraway lhat the cyborg construct of postmodern culture is necessary to deconstruct boundaries and to open a new space of subjectivityidentity However in the way it is represented in the ques tion of living the cyborg is a discursive space where the crisis of postmodern thought occurs In both Star Trek and Blade Runner there is a subjectivity objectified in psycllOanalytical terms and as such it reinstalls the Cartesian and Newtonian epistemology in the tableau of nature The question of ontology should be a matter of discursive subjectivity tharwhich concerns the space of representa tion and not the tableau itself The discursive subjectivity is notthe focalized the object represented in the tibleau butthe focalization the tnode ofthinking that allows any object to be represented or to exist lnthat respect the discur sive subjectivity in Star Trek andBlade Runner is this discursive space opened by the concept of similarity that reveals the Cartesian and Newtonianepiste mology In a postmodern culture and cyberspace world the question of living is a matter ofmetaphor that needs to be questioned Infact the metaphor opens a crisis and a transference between machine and organism in which the objecti fied subjectivity through Freudian andLacanian models is at stake As a result the cyborg becomes a problematic signifier pointing at the impossibility to over come the dichotomies Cyborg as Problematic Signifier vidual essentially the same as itself   and finally what might be called closure that is the production of every living being through the sole action of the biological forces animating a progenitor of its own nature Lestienne 144 3 The dichotomies are usually humannonhuman and organismmachineAt times they overlap such as humanmachine By pointing at humanorganism I refer to an
