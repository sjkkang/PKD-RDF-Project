CHAPTER 1 A merry little surge of electricity piped by automatic alarm from the mood organ beside his bed awakened Rick Deckard Surprisedit always surprised him to find himself awake without prior noticehe rose from the bed stood up in his multicolored pajamas and stretched Now in her bed his wife Iran opened her gray unmerry eyes blinked then groaned and shut her eyes again You set your Penfield too weak he said to her Ill reset it and youll be awake and Keep your hand off my settings Her voice held bitter sharpness I dont want to be awake He seated himself beside her bent over her and explained softly If you set the surge up high enough youll be glad youre awake thats the whole point At setting C it overcomes the threshold barring consciousness as it does for me Friendlily because he felt welldisposed toward the world his setting had been at D he patted her bare pale shoulder Get your crude cops hand away Iran said Im not a cop He felt irritable now although he hadnt dialed for it Youre worse his wife said her eyes still shut Youre a murderer hired by the cops Ive never killed a human being in my life His irritability had risen now had become outright hostility Iran said Just those poor andys I notice youve never had any hesitation as to spending the bounty money I bring home on whatever momentarily attracts your attention He rose strode to the console of his mood organ Instead of saving he said so we could buy a real sheep to replace that fake electric one upstairs A mere electric animal and me earning all that Ive worked my way up to through the years At his console he hesitated between dialing for a thalamic suppressant which would abolish his mood of rage or a thalamic stimulant which would make him irked enough to win the argument If you dial Iran said eyes open and watching for greater venom then Ill dial the same Ill dial the maximum and youll see a fight that makes every argument weve had up to now seem like nothing Dial and see just try me She rose swiftly loped to the console of her own mood organ stood glaring at him waiting He sighed defeated by her threat Ill dial whats on my schedule for today Examining the schedule for January 3 1992 he saw that a businesslike professional attitude was called for If I dial by schedule he said warily will you agree to also He waited canny enough not to commit himself until his wife had agreed to follow suit My schedule for today lists a sixhour selfaccusatory depression Iran said What Why did you schedule that It defeated the whole purpose of the mood organ I didnt even know you could set it for that he said gloomily I was sitting here one afternoon Iran said and naturally I had turned on Buster Friendly and His Friendly Friends and he was talking about a big news item hes about to break and then that awful commercial came on the one I hate you know for Mountibank Lead Codpieces And so for a minute I shut off the sound And I heard the building this building I heard the She gestured Empty apartments Rick said Sometimes he heard them at night when he was supposed to be asleep And yet for this day and age a onehalf occupied conapt building rated high in the scheme of population density out in what had been before the war the suburbs one could find buildings entirely empty  or so he had heard He had let the information remain secondhand like most people he did not care to experience it directly At that moment Iran said when I had the TV sound off I was in a 382 mood I had just dialed it So although I heard the emptiness intellectually I didnt feel it My first reaction consisted of being grateful that we could afford a Penfield mood organ But then I read how unhealthy it was sensing the absence of life not just in this building but everywhere and not reactingdo you see I guess you dont But that used to be considered a sign of mental illness they called it absence of appropriate affect So I left the TV sound off and I sat down at my mood organ and I experimented And I finally found a setting for despair Her dark pert face showed satisfaction as if she had achieved something of worth So I put it on my schedule for twice a month I think thats a reasonable amount of time to feel hopeless about everything about staying here on Earth after everybody whos small has emigrated dont you think But a mood like that Rick said youre apt to stay in it not dial your way out Despair like that about total reality is selfperpetuating I program an automatic resetting for three hours later his wife said sleekly A 481 Awareness of the manifold possibilities open to me in the future new hope that I know 481 he interrupted He had dialed out the combination many times he relied on it greatly Listen he said seating himself on his bed and taking hold of her hands to draw her down beside him even with an automatic cutoff its dangerous to undergo a depression any kind Forget what youve scheduled and Ill forget what Ive scheduled well dial a 104 together and both experience it and then you stay in it while I reset mine for my usual businesslike attitude That way Ill want to hop up to the roof and check out the sheep and then head for the office meanwhile Ill know youre not sitting here brooding with no TV He released her slim long fingers passed through the spacious apartment to the living room which smelled faintly of last nights cigarettes There he bent to turn on the TV From the bedroom Irans voice came I cant stand TV before breakfast Dial 888 Rick said as the set warmed The desire to watch TV no matter whats on it I dont feel like dialing anything at all now Iran said Then dial 3 he said I cant dial a setting that stimulates my cerebral cortex into wanting to dial If I dont want to dial I dont want to dial that most of all because then I will want to dial and wanting to dial is right now the most alien drive I can imagine I just want to sit here on the bed and stare at the floor Her voice had become sharp with overtones of bleakness as her soul congealed and she ceased to move as the instinctive omnipresent film of great weight of an almost absolute inertia settled over her He turned up the TV sound and the voice of Buster Friendly boomed out and filled the room ho ho folks Time now for a brief note on todays weather The Mongoose satellite reports that fallout will be especially pronounced toward noon and will then taper off so all you folks wholl be venturing out Appearing beside him her long nightgown trailing wispily Iran shut off the TV set Okay I give up Ill dial Anything you want me to be ecstatic sexual blissI feel so bad Ill even endure that What the hell What difference does it make Ill dial for both of us Rick said and led her back into the bedroom There at her console he dialed 594 pleased acknowledgment of husbands superior wisdom in all matters On his own console he dialed for a creative and fresh attitude toward his job although this he hardly needed such was his habitual innate approach without recourse to Penfield artificial brain stimulation After a hurried breakfasthe had lost time due to the discussion with his wifehe ascended clad for venturing out including his Ajax model Mountibank Lead Codpiece to the covered roof pasture whereon his electric sheep grazed Whereon it sophisticated piece of hardware that it was chomped away in simulated contentment bamboozling the other tenants of the building Of course some of their animals undoubtedly consisted of electronic circuitry fakes too he had of course never nosed into the matter any more than they his neighbors had pried into the real workings of his sheep Nothing could be more impolite To say Is your sheep genuine would be a worse breach of manners than to inquire whether a citizens teeth hair or internal organs would test out authentic The morning air spilling over with radioactive motes gray and sunbeclouding belched about him haunting his nose fie sniffed involuntarily the taint of death Well that was too strong a description for it he decided as he made his way to the particular plot of sod which he owned along with the unduly large apartment below The legacy of World War Terminus had diminished in potency those who could not survive the dust had passed into oblivion years ago and the dust weaker now and confronting the strong survivors only deranged minds and genetic properties Despite his lead codpiece the dustundoubtedlyfiltered in and at him brought him daily so long as he failed to emigrate its little load of befouling filth So far medical checkups taken monthly confirmed him as a regular a man who could reproduce within the tolerances set by law Any month however the exam by the San Francisco Police Department doctors could reveal otherwise Continually new specials came into existence created out of regulars by the omnipresent dust The saying currently blabbed by posters TV ads and government junk mail ran Emigrate or degenerate The choice is yours  Very true Rick thought as he opened the gate to his little pasture and approached his electric sheep But I cant emigrate he said to himself Because of my job The owner of the adjoining pasture his conapt neighbor Bill Barbour hailed him he like Rick had dressed for work but had stopped off on the way to check his animal too My horse Barbour declared beamingly is pregnant He indicated the big Percheron which stood staring off in an empty fashion into space What do you say to that I say pretty soon youll have two horses Rick said He had reached his sheep now it lay ruminating its alert eyes fixed on him in case he had brought any rolled oats with him The alleged sheep contained an oattropic circuit at the sight of such cereals it would scramble up convincingly and amble over Whats she pregnant by he asked Barbour The wind I bought some of the highest quality fertilizing plasma available in California Barbour informed him Through inside contacts I have with the State Animal Husbandry Board Dont you remember last week when their inspector was out here examining Judy Theyre eager to have her foal shes an unmatched superior Barbour thumped his horse fondly on the neck and she inclined her head toward him Ever thought of selling your horse Rick asked He wished to god he had a horse in fact any animal Owning and maintaining a fraud had a way of gradually demoralizing one And yet from a social standpoint it had to be done given the absence of the real article He had therefore no choice except to continue Even were he not to care himself there remained his wife and Iran did care Very much Barbour said It would be immoral to sell my horse Sell the colt then Having two animals is more immoral than not having any Puzzled Barbour said How do you mean A lot of people have two animals even three four and like in the case of Fred Washborne who owns the algaeprocessing plant my brother works at even five Didnt you see that article about his duck in yesterdays Chronicle Its supposed to be the heaviest largest Moscovy on the West Coast The mans eyes glazed over imagining such possessions he drifted by degrees into a trance Exploring about in his coat pockets Rick found his creased muchstudied copy of Sidneys Animal  Fowl Catalogue January supplement He looked in the index found colts vide horses offsp and presently had the prevailing national price I can buy a Percheron colt from Sidneys for five thousand dollars he said aloud No you cant Barbour said Look at the listing again its in italics That means they dont have any in stock but that would be the price if they did have Suppose Rick said I pay you five hundred dollars a month for ten months Full catalogue value Pityingly Barbour said Deckard you dont understand about horses theres a reason why Sidneys doesnt have any Percheron colts in stock Percheron colts just dont change handsat catalogue value even Theyre too scarce even relatively inferior ones He leaned across their common fence gesticulating Ive had Judy for three years and not in all that time have I seen a Percheron mare of her quality To acquire her I had to fly to Canada and I personally drove her back here myself to make sure she wasnt stolen You bring an animal like this anywhere around Colorado or Wyoming and theyll knock you off to get hold of it You know why Because back before WWT there existed literally hundreds But Rick interrupted for you to have two horses and me none that violates the whole basic theological and moral structure of Mercerism You have your sheep hell you can follow the Ascent in your individual life and when you grasp the two handles of empathy you approach honorably Now if you didnt have that old sheep there Id see some logic in your position Sure if I had two animals and you didnt have any Id be helping deprive you of true fusion with Mercer But every family in this buildinglets see around fifty one to every three apts as I compute it every one of us has an animal of some sort Graveson has that chicken over there He gestured north Oakes and his wife have that big red dog that barks in the night He pondered I think Ed Smith has a cat down in his apt at least he says so but no ones ever seen it Possibly hes just pretending Going over to his sheep Rick bent down searching in the thick white woolthe fleece at least was genuineuntil he found what he was looking for the concealed control panel of the mechanism As Barbour watched he snapped open the panel covering revealing it See he said to Barbour You understand now why I want your colt so badly After an interval Barbour said You poor guy Has it always been this way No Rick said once again closing the panel covering of his electric sheep he straightened up turned and faced his neighbor I had a real sheep originally My wifes father gave it to us outright when he emigrated Then about a year ago remember that time I took it to the vetyou were up here that morning when I came out and found it lying on its side and it couldnt get up You got it to its feet Barbour said remembering and nodding Yeah you managed to lift it up but then after a minute or two of walking around it fell over again Rick said Sheep get strange diseases Or put another way sheep get a lot of diseases but the symptoms are always the same the sheep cant get up and theres no way to tell how serious it is whether its a sprained leg or the animals dying of tetanus Thats what mine died of tetanus Up here Barbour said On the roof The hay Rick explained That one time I didnt get all the wire off the bale I left a piece and Grouchothats what I called him thengot a scratch and in that way contracted tetanus I took him to the vets and he died and I thought about it and finally I called one of those shops that manufacture artificial animals and I showed them a photograph of Groucho They made this He indicated the reclining ersatz animal which continued to ruminate attentively still watching alertly for any indication of oats Its a premium job And Ive put as much time and attention into caring for it as I did when it was real But He shrugged Its not the same Barbour finished But almost You feel the same doing it you have to keep your eye on it exactly as you did when it was really alive Because they break down and then everyone in the building knows Ive had it at the repair shop six times mostly little malfunctions but if anyone saw themfor instance one time the voice tape broke or anyhow got fouled and it wouldnt stop baaingtheyd recognize it as a mechanical breakdown He added The repair outfits truck is of course marked animal hospital something And the driver dresses like a vet completely in white He glanced suddenly at his watch remembering the time I have to get to work he said to Barbour Ill see you this evening As he started toward his car Barbour called after him hurriedly Um I wont say anything to anybody here in the building Pausing Rick started to say thanks But then something of the despair that Iran had been talking about tapped him on the shoulder and he said I dont know maybe it doesnt make any difference But theyll look down on you Not all of them but some You know how people are about not taking care of an animal they consider it immoral and antiempathic I mean technically its not a crime like it was right after WWT but the feelings still there God Rick said futilely and gestured emptyhanded I want to have an animal I keep trying to buy one But on my salary on what a city employee makes If he thought I could get lucky in my work again As I did two years ago when I managed to bag four andys during one month If I had known then he thought that Groucho was going to die  but that had been before the tetanus Before the twoinch piece of broken hypodermiclike baling wire You could buy a cat Barbour offered Cats are cheap look in your Sidneys catalogue Rick said quietly I dont want a domestic pet I want what I originally had a large animal A sheep or if I can get the money a cow or a steer or what you have a horse The bounty from retiring five andys would do it he realized A thousand dollars apiece over and above my salary Then somewhere I could find from someone what I want Even if the listing in Sidneys Animal  Fowl is in italics Five thousand dollarsbut he thought the five andys first have to make their way to Earth from one of the colony planets I cant control that I cant make five of them come here and even if I could there are other bounty hunters with other police agencies throughout the world The andys would specifically have to take up residence in Northern California and the senior bounty hunter in this area Dave Holden would have to die or retire Buy a cricket Barbour suggested wittily Or a mouse Hey for twentyfive bucks you can buy a fullgrown mouse Rick said Your horse could die like Groucho died without warning When you get home from work this evening you could find her laid out on her back her feet in the air like a bug Like what you said a cricket He strode off car key in his hand Sorry if I offended you Barbour said nervously In silence Rick Deckard plucked open the door of his hovercar He had nothing further to say to his neighbor his mind was on his work on the day ahead CHAPTER 2 In a giant empty decaying building which had once housed thousands a single TV set hawked its wares to an uninhabited room This ownerless ruin had before World War Terminus been tended and maintained Here had been the suburbs of San Francisco a short ride by monorail rapid transit the entire peninsula had chattered like a bird tree with life and opinions and complaints and now the watchful owners had either died or migrated to a colony world Mostly the former it had been a costly war despite the valiant predictions of the Pentagon and its smug scientific vassel the Rand Corporationwhich had in fact existed not far from this spot Like the apartment owners the corporation had departed evidently for good No one missed it In addition no one today remembered why the war had come about or who if anyone had won The dust which had contaminated most of the planets surface had originated in no country and no one even the wartime enemy had planned on it First strangely the owls had died At the time it had seemed almost funny the fat fluffy white birds lying here and there in yards and on streets coming out no earlier than twilight as they had while alive the owls escaped notice Medieval plagues had manifested themselves in a similar way in the form of many dead rats This plague however had descended from above After the owls of course the other birds followed but by then the mystery had been grasped and understood A meager colonization program had been underway before the war but now that the sun had ceased to shine on Earth the colonization entered an entirely new phase In connection with this a weapon of war the Synthetic Freedom Fighter had been modified able to function on an alien world the humanoid robotstrictly speaking the organic androidhad become the mobile donkey engine of the colonization program Under UN law each emigrant automatically received possession of an android subtype of his choice and by 1990 the variety of subtypes passed all understanding in the manner of American automobiles of the ig6os That had been the ultimate incentive of emigration the android servant as carrot the radioactive fallout as stick The UN had made it easy to emigrate difficult if not impossible to stay Loitering on Earth potentially meant finding oneself abruptly classed as biologically unacceptable a menace to the pristine heredity of the race Once pegged as special a citizen even if accepting sterilization dropped out of history He ceased in effect to be part of mankind And yet persons here and there declined to migrate that even to those involved constituted a perplexing irrationality Logically every regular should have emigrated already Perhaps deformed as it was Earth remained familiar to be clung to Or possibly the nonemigrant imagined that the tent of dust would deplete itself finally In any case thousands of individuals remained most of them constellated in urban areas where they could physically see one another take heart at their mutual presence Those appeared to be the relatively sane ones And in dubious addition to them occasional peculiar entities remained in the virtually abandoned suburbs John Isidore being yammered at by the television set in his living room as he shaved in the bathroom was one of these He simply had wandered to this spot in the early days following the war In those evil times no one had known really what they were doing Populations detached by the war had roamed squatted temporarily at first one region and then another Back then the fallout had been sporadic and highly variable some states had been nearly free of it others became saturated The displaced populations moved as the dust moved The peninsula south of San Francisco had been at first dustfree and a great body of persons had responded by taking up residence there when the dust arrived some had died and the rest had departed J R Isidore remained The TV set shouted duplicates the halcyon days of the preCivil War Southern states Either as body servants or tireless field hands the customtailored humanoid robot designed specifically for YOUR UNIQUE NEEDS FOR YOU AND YOU ALONEgiven to you on your arrival absolutely free equipped fully as specified by you before your departure from Earth this loyal troublefree companion in the greatest boldest adventure contrived by man in modern history will provide It continued on and on I wonder if Im late for work Isidore wondered as he scraped He did not own a working clock generally he depended on the TV for time signals but today was Interspace Horizons Day evidently Anyhow the TV claimed this to be the fifth or sixth anniversary of the founding of New America the chief US settlement on Mars And his TV set being partly broken picked up only the channel which had been nationalized during the war and still remained so the government in Washington with its colonization program constituted the sole sponsor which Isidore found himself forced to listen to Lets hear from Mrs Maggie Klugman the TV announcer suggested to John Isidore who wanted only to know the time A recent immigrant to Mars Mrs Klugman in an interview taped live in New New York had this to say Mrs Klugman how would you contrast your life back on contaminated Earth with your new life here in a world rich with every imaginable possibility A pause and then a tired dry middleaged female voice said I think what I and my family of three noticed most was the dignity The dignity Mrs Klugman  the announcer asked Yes Mrs Klugman now of New New York Mars said Its a hard thing to explain Having a servant you can depend on in these troubled times  I find it reassuring Back on Earth Mrs Klugman in the old days did you also worry about finding yourself classified ahem as a special Oh my husband and myself worried ourselves nearly to death Of course once we emigrated that worry vanished fortunately forever To himself John Isidore thought acidly And its gone away for me too without my having to emigrate He had been a special now for over a year and not merely in regard to the distorted genes which he carried Worse still he had failed to pass the minimum mental faculties test which made him in popular parlance a chickenhead Upon him the contempt of three planets descended However despite this he survived He had his job driving a pickup and delivery truck for a falseanimal repair firm the Van Ness Pet Hospital and his gloomy gothic boss Hannibal Sloat accepted him as human and this he appreciated Mors certa vita incerta  as Mr Sloat occasionally declared Isidore although he had heard the expression a number of times retained only a dim notion as to its meaning After all if a chickenhead could fathom Latin he would cease to be a chickenhead Mr Sloat when this was pointed out to him acknowledged its truth And there existed chickenheads infinitely stupider than Isidore who could hold no jobs at all who remained in custodial institutions quaintly called Institute of Special Trade Skills of America the word special having to get in there somehow as always your husband felt no protection the TV announcer was saying in owning and continually wearing an expensive and clumsy radiationproof lead codpiece Mrs Klugman My husband Mrs Klugman began but at that point having finished shaving Isidore strode into the living room and shut off the TV set Silence It flashed from the woodwork and the walls it smote him with an awful total power as if generated by a vast mill It rose from the floor up out of the tattered gray walltowall carpeting It unleashed itself from the broken and semibroken appliances in the kitchen the dead machines which hadnt worked in all the time Isidore had lived here From the useless pole lamp in the living room it oozed out meshing with the empty and wordless descent of itself from the flyspecked ceiling It managed in fact to emerge from every object within his range of vision as if itthe silence meant to supplant all things tangible Hence it assailed not only his ears but his eyes as he stood by the inert TV set he experienced the silence as visible and in its own way alive Alive He had often felt its austere approach before when it came it burst in without subtlety evidently unable to wait The silence of the world could not rein back its greed Not any longer Not when it had virtually won He wondered then if the others who had remained on Earth experienced the void this way Or was it peculiar to his peculiar biological identity a freak generated by his inept sensory apparatus Interesting question Isidore thought But whom could he compare notes with He lived alone in this deteriorating blind building of a thousand uninhabited apartments which like all its counterparts fell day by day into greater entropic ruin Eventually everything within the building would merge would be faceless and identical mere puddinglike kipple piled to the ceiling of each apartment And after that the uncaredfor building itself would settle into shapelessness buried under the ubiquity of the dust By then naturally he himself would be dead another interesting event to anticipate as he stood here in his stricken living room atone with the lungless allpenetrating masterful worldsilence Better perhaps to turn the TV back on But the ads directed at the remaining regulars frightened him They informed him in a countless procession of ways that he a special wasnt wanted Had no use Could not even if he wanted to emigrate So why listen to that He asked himself irritably Fork them and their colonization I hope a war gets started thereafter all it theoretically couldand they wind up like Earth And everybody who emigrated turns out to be special Okay he thought Im off to work He reached for the doorknob that opened the way out into the unlit hall then shrank back as he glimpsed the vacuity of the rest of the building It lay in wait for him out here the force which he had felt busily penetrating his specific apartment God he thought and reshut the door He was not ready for the trip up those clanging stairs to the empty roof where he had no animal The echo of himself ascending the echo of nothing Time to grasp the handles he said to himself and crossed the living room to the black empathy box When he turned it on the usual faint smell of negative ions surged from the power supply he breathed in eagerly already buoyed up Then the cathoderay tube glowed like an imitation feeble TV image a collage formed made of apparently random colors trails and configurations which until the handles were grasped amounted to nothing So taking a deep breath to steady himself he grasped the twin handles The visual image congealed he saw at once a famous landscape the old brown barren ascent with tufts of driedout bonelike weeds poking slantedly into a dim and sunless sky One single figure more or less human in form toiled its way up the hillside an elderly man wearing a dull featureless robe covering as meager as if it had been snatched from the hostile emptiness of the sky The man Wilbur Mercer plodded ahead and as he clutched the handles John Isidore gradually experienced a waning of the living room in which he stood the dilapidated furniture and walls ebbed out and he ceased to experience them at all He found himself instead as always before entering into the landscape of drab hill drab sky And at the same time he no longer witnessed the climb of the elderly man His own feet now scraped sought purchase among the familiar loose stones he felt the same old painful irregular roughness beneath his feet and once again smelled the acrid haze of the skynot Earths sky but that of some place alien distant and yet by means of the empathy box instantly available He had crossed over in the usual perplexing fashion physical mergingaccompanied by mental and spiritual identificationwith Wilbur Mercer had reoccurred As it did for everyone who at this moment clutched the handles either here on Earth or on one of the colony planets He experienced them the others incorporated the babble of their thoughts heard in his own brain the noise of their many individual existences Theyand hecared about one thing this fusion of their mentalities oriented their attention on the hill the climb the need to ascend Step by step it evolved so slowly as to be nearly imperceptible But it was there Higher he thought as stones rattled downward under his feet Today we are higher than yesterday and tomorrowhe the compound figure of Wilbur Mercer glanced up to view the ascent ahead Impossible to make out the end Too far But it would come A rock hurled at him struck his arm He felt the pain He half turned and another rock sailed past him missing him it collided with the earth and the sound startled him Who he wondered peering to see his tormentor The old antagonists manifesting themselves at the periphery of his vision it or they had followed him all the way up the hill and they would remain until at the top He remembered the top the sudden leveling of the hill when the climb ceased and the other part of it began How many times had he done this The several times blurred future and past blurred what he had already experienced and what he would eventually experience blended so that nothing remained but the moment the standing still and resting during which he rubbed the cut on his arm which the stone had left God he thought in weariness In what way is this fair Why am I up here alone like this being tormented by something I cant even see And then within him the mutual babble of everyone else in fusion broke the illusion of aloneness You felt it too he thought Yes the voices answered We got hit on the left arm it hurts like hell Okay he said We better get started moving again He resumed walking and all of them accompanied him immediately Once he remembered it had been different Back before the curse had come an earlier happier part of life They his foster parents Frank and Cora Mercer had found him floating on an inflated rubber airrescue raft off the coast of New England  or had it been Mexico near the port of Tampico He did not now remember the circumstances Childhood had been nice he had loved all life especially the animals had in fact been able for a time to bring dead animals back as they had been He lived with rabbits and bugs wherever it was either on Earth or a colony world now he had forgotten that too But he recalled the killers because they had arrested him as a freak more special than any of the other specials And due to that everything had changed Local law prohibited the timereversal faculty by which the dead returned to life they had spelled it out to him during his sixteenth year He continued for another year to do it secret  in the still remaining woods but an old woman whom he had never seen or heard of had told Without his parents consent theythe killershad bombarded the unique nodule which had formed in his brain had attacked it with radioactive cobalt and this had plunged him into a different world one whose existence he had never suspected It had been a pit of corpses and dead bones and he had struggled for years to get up from it The donkey and especially the toad the creatures most important to him had vanished had become extinct only rotting fragments an eyeless head here part of a hand there remained At last a bird which had come there to die told him where he was He had sunk down into the tomb world He could not get out until the bones strewn around him grew back into living creatures he had become joined to the metabolism of other lives and until they rose he could not rise either How long that part of the cycle had lasted he did not now know nothing had happened generally so it had been measureless But at last the bones had regained flesh the empty eyepits had filled up and the new eyes had seen while meantime the restored beaks and mouths had cackled barked and caterwauled Possibly he had done it perhaps the extrasensory node of his brain had finally grown back Or maybe he hadnt accomplished it very likely it could have been a natural process Anyhow he was no longer sinking he had begun to ascend along with the others Long ago he had lost sight of them He found himself evidently climbing alone But they were there They still accompanied him he felt them strangely inside him Isidore stood holding the two handles experiencing himself as encompassing every other living thing and then reluctantly he let go It had to end as always and anyhow his arm ached and bled where the rock had struck it Releasing the handles he examined his arm then made his way unsteadily to the bathroom of his apartment to wash the cut off was not the first wound he had received while in fusion with Mercer and it probably would not be the last People especially elderly ones had died particularly later on at the top of the hill alien the torment began in earnest I wonder if I can go through that part again he said to himself as he swabbed the injury Chance of cardiac arrest he better he reflected if I lived in town where those buildings have a doctor standing by with those electrospark machines Here alone in this place its too risky But he knew hed take the risk He always had before As did most people even oldsters who were physically fragile Using a Kleenex he dried his damaged arm And heard muffled and far off a TV set Its someone else in this building he thought wildly unable to believe it Not my TV thats off and I can feel the floor resonance Its below on another level entirely Im not alone here any more  he realized Another resident has moved in taken one of the abandoned apartments and close enough for me to hear him Must be level two or level three certainly no deeper Lets see he thought rapidly What do you do when a new resident moves in Drop by and borrow something is that how its done He could not remember this had never happened to him before here or anywhere else people moved out people emigrated but nobody ever moved in You take them something he decided Like a cup of water or rather milk yes its milk or flour or maybe an eggor specifically their ersatz substitutes Looking in his refrigeratorthe compressor had long since ceased workinghe found a dubious cube of margarine And with it set off excitedly his heart laboring for the level below I have to keep calm he realized Not let him know Im a chickenhead If he finds out Im a cliickenhead he wont talk to me thats always the way it is for some reason I wonder why He hurried down the hall CHAPTER 3 On his way to work Rick Deckard as lord knew how many other people stopped briefly to skulk about in front of one of San Franciscos larger pet shops along animal row In the center of the blocklong display window an ostrich in a heated clearplastic cage returned his stare The bird according to the info plaque attached to the cage had just arrived from a zoo in Cleveland It was the only ostrich on the West Coast After staring at it Rick spent a few more minutes staring grimly at the price tag He then continued on to the Hall of justice on Lombard Street and found himself a quarter of an hour late to work As he unlocked his office door his superior Police Inspector Harry Bryant jugeared and redheaded sloppily dressed but wiseeyed and conscious of nearly everything of any importance hailed him Meet me at ninethirty in Dave Holdens office Inspector Bryant as he spoke flicked briefly through a clipboard of onionskin typed sheets Holden he continued as he started off is in Mount Zion Hospital with a laser track through his spine Hell be there for a month at least Until they can get one of those new organic plastic spinal sections to take hold What happened Rick asked chilled The departments chief bounty hunter had been all right yesterday at the end of the day he had as usual zipped off in his hovercar to his apartment in the crowded highprestige Nob Hill area of the City Bryant muttered over his shoulder something about ninethirty in Daves office and departed leaving Rick standing alone As he entered his own office Rick heard the voice of his secretary Ann Marsten behind him Mr Deckard you know what happened to Mr Holden He got shot She followed after him into the stuffy closedup office and set the airfiltering unit into motion Yeah he responded absently It must have been one of those new extraclever andys the Rosen Association is turning out Miss Marsten said Did you read over the companys brochure and the spec sheets The Nexus6 brain unit theyre using now is capable of selecting within a field of two trillion constituents or ten million separate neural pathways She lowered her voice You missed the vidcall this morning Miss Wild told me it came through the switchboard exactly at nine A call in Rick asked Miss Marsten said A call out by Mr Bryant to the WPO in Russia Asking them if they would be willing to file a formal written complaint with the Rosen Associations factory representative East Harry still wants the Nexus6 brain unit withdrawn from the market He felt no surprise Since the initial release of its specifications and performance charts back in August of 1991 most police agencies which dealt with escaped andys had been protesting The Soviet police cant do any more than we can he said Legally the manufacturers of the Nexus6 brain unit operated under colonial law their parent autofactory being on Mars We had better just accept the new unit as a fact of life he said Its always been this way with every improved brain unit thats come along I remember the howls of pain when the Sudermann people showed their old T14 back in 89 Every police agency in the Western Hemisphere clamored that no test would detect its presence in an instance of illegal entry here As a matter of fact for a while they were right Over fifty of the T14 android as he recalled had made their way by one means or another to Earth and had not been detected for a period in some cases up to an entire year But then the Voigt Empathy Test had been devised by the Pavlov Institute working in the Soviet Union And no T14 androidinsofar at least as was known had managed to pass that particular test Want to know what the Russian police said Miss Marsten asked I know that too Her freckled orange face glowed Rick said Ill find out from Harry Bryant He felt irritable office gossip annoyed him because it always proved better than the truth Seating himself at his desk he pointedly fished about in a drawer until Miss Marsten perceiving the hint departed From the drawer he produced an ancient creased manila envelope Leaning back tilting his importantstyle chair he rummaged among the contents of the envelope until he came across what he wanted the collected extant data on the Nexus6 A moments reading vindicated Miss Marstens statement the Nexus6 did have two trillion constituents plus a choice within a range of ten million possible combinations of cerebral activity In 45 of a second an android equipped with such a brain structure could assume any one of fourteen basic reactionpostures Well no intelligence test would trap such an andy But then intelligence tests hadnt trapped an andy in years not since the primordial crude varieties of the 70s The Nexus6 android types Rick reflected surpassed several classes of human specials in terms of intelligence In other words androids equipped with the new Nexus6 brain unit had from a sort of rough pragmatic nononsense standpoint evolved beyond a majorbut inferiorsegment of mankind For better or worse The servant had in some cases become more adroit than its master But new scales of achievement for example the VoigtKampff Empathy Test had emerged as criteria by which to judge An android no matter how gifted as to pure intellectual capacity could make no sense out of the fusion which took place routinely among the followers of Mercerisman experience which he and virtually everyone else including subnormal chickenheads managed with no difficulty He had wondered as had most people at one time or another precisely why an android bounced helplessly about when confronted by an empathymeasuring test Empathy evidently existed only within the human community whereas intelligence to some degree could be found throughout every phylum and order including the arachnids For one thing the emphatic faculty probably required an unimpaired group instinct a solitary organism such as a spider would have no use for it in fact it would tend to abort a spiders ability to survive It would make him conscious of the desire to live on the part of his prey Hence all predators even highly developed mammals such as cats would starve Empathy he once had decided must be limited to herbivores or anyhow omnivores who could depart from a meat diet Because ultimatley the emphatic gift blurred the boundaries between hunter and victim between the successful and the defeated As in the fusion with Mercer everyone ascended together or when the cycle had come to an end fell together into the trough of the tomb world Oddly it resembled a sort of biological insurance but doubleedged As long as some creature experienced joy then the condition for all other creatures included a fragment of joy However if any living being suffered then for all the rest the shadow could not be entirely cast off A herd animal such as man would acquire a higher survival factor through this an owl or a cobra would be destroyed Evidently the humanoid robot constituted a solitary predator Rick liked to think of them that way it made his job palatable In retiringie killingan andy he did not violate the rule of life laid down by Mercer You shall kill only the kill ers  Mercer had told them the year empathy boxes first appeared on Earth And in Mercerism as it evolved into a full theology the concept of The Killers had grown insidiously In Mercerism an absolute evil plucked at the threadbare cloak of the tottering ascending old man but it was never clear who or what this evil presence was A Mercerite sensed evil without understanding it Put another way a Mercerite was free to locate the nebulous presence of The Killers wherever he saw fit For Rick Deckard an escaped humanoid robot which had killed its master which had been equipped with an intelligence greater than that of many human beings which had no regard for animals which possessed no ability to feel emphatic joy for another life forms success or grief at its defeatthat for him epitomized The Killers Thinking about animals reminded him of the ostrich he had seen in the pet store Temporarily he pushed away the specs on the Nexus6 brain unit took a pinch of Mrs Siddons No 3  4 snuff and cogitated Then he examined his watch saw that he had time he picked up his desk vidphone and said to Miss Marsten Get me the Happy Dog Pet Shop on Sutter Street Yes sir Miss Marsten said and opened her phone book They cant really want that much for the ostrich Rick said to himself They expect you to cartrade like in the old days Happy Dog Pet Shop a mans voice declared and on Ricks vidscreen a minute happy face appeared Animals could be heard bawling That ostrich you have in your display window Rich said he toyed with a ceramic ashtray before him on the desk What sort of a down payment would I need for that Lets see the animal salesman said groping for a pen and pad of paper Onethird down He figured May I ask sit if youre going to trade something in Guardedly Rick said I havent decided Lets say we put the ostrich on a thirtymonth contract the salesman said At a low low interest rate of six percent a month That would make your monthly payment after a reasonable down Youll have to lower the price youre asking Rick said Knock off two thousand and I wont trade anything in Ill come up with cash Dave Holden he reflected is out of action That could mean a great deal  depending on how many assignments show up during the coming month Sir the animal salesman said our asking price is already a thousand dollars under book Check your Sidneys Ill hang on I want you to see for yourself sir that our price is fair Christ Rick thought Theyre standing firm However just for the heck of it he wiggled his bent Sidneys out of his coat pocket thumbed to ostrich comma malefemale oldyoung sickwell mintused and inspected the prices Mint male young well the salesman informed him Thirty thousand dollars He too had his Sidneys out Were exactly one thousand under book Now your down payment Ill think it over Rick said and call you back He started to hang up Your name sir the salesman asked alertly Frank Merriwell Rick said And your address Mr Merriwell In case Im not here when you call back He made up an address and put the vidphone receiver back on its cradle All that money he thought And yet people buy them some people have that kind of money Picking up the receiver again he said harshly Give me an outside line Miss Marsten And dont listen in on the conversation its confidential He glared at her Yes sir Miss Marsten said Go ahead and dial She then cut herself out of the circuit leaving him to face the outside world He dialedby memorythe number of the falseanimal shop at which he had gotten his ersatz sheep On the small vidscreen a man dressed like a vet appeared Dr McRae the man declared This is Deckard How much is an electric ostrich Oh Id say we could fix you up for less than eight hundred dollars How soon did you want delivery We would have to make it up for you theres not that much call for Ill talk to you later Rick interrupted glancing at his watch he saw that ninethirty had arrived Goodby He hurriedly hung up rose and shortly thereafter stood before Inspector Bryants office door He passed by Bryants receptionistattractive with waistlength braided silver hairand then the inspectors secretary an ancient monster from the Jurassic swamp frozen and sly like some archaic apparition fixated in the tomb world Neither woman spoke to him nor he to them Opening the inner door he nodded to his superior who was busy on the phone seating himself he got out the specs on Nexus6 which he had brought with him and once more read them over as Inspector Bryant talked away He felt depressed And yet logically because of Daves sudden disappearance from the work scene he should be at least guardedly pleased CHAPTER 4 Maybe Im worried Rick Deckard conjectured that what happened to Dave will happen to me An andy smart enough to laser him could probably take me too But that didnt seem to be it I see you brought the poop sheet on that new brain unit Inspector Bryant said hanging up the vidphone Rick said Yeah I heard about it on the grapevine How many andys are involved and how far did Dave get Eight to start with Bryant said consulting his clipboard Dave got the first two And the remaining six are here in Northern California As far as we know Dave thinks so That was him I was talking to I have his notes they were in his desk He says all he knows is here Bryant tapped the bundle of notepaper So far he did not seem inclined to pass the notes on to Rick for some reason he continued to leaf through them himself frowning and working his tongue in and around the fringes of his mouth I have nothing on I my agenda Rick offered Im ready to take over in Daves place Bryant said thoughtfully Dave used the VoigtKampff Altered Scale in testing out the individuals he suspected You realizeyou ought to anyhowthat this test isnt specific for the new brain units No test is the Voigt scale altered three years ago by Kampff is all we have He paused pondering Dave considered it accurate Maybe it is But I would suggest this before you take out after these six Again he tapped the pile of notes Fly to Seattle and talk with the Rosen people Have them supply you a representative sampling of types employing the new Nexus6 unit And put them through the VoigtKampff Rick said It sounds so easy Bryant said half to himself Pardon Bryant said I think Ill talk to the Rosen organization myself while youre on your way He eyed Rick then silently Finally he grunted gnawed on a fingernail and eventually decided on what he wanted to say Im going to discuss with them the possibility of including several humans as well as their new androids But you wont know Itll be my decision in conjunction with the manufacturers It should be set up by the time you get there He abruptly pointed at Rick his face severe This is the first time youll be acting as senior bounty bunter Dave knows a lot hes got years of experience behind him So have I Rick said tensely Youve handled assignments devolving to you from Daves schedule hes always decided exactly which ones to turn over to you and which not to But now youve got six that he intended to retire himselfone of which managed to get him first This one Bryant turned the notes around so that Rick could see Max Polokov Bryant said Thats what it calls itself anyhow Assuming Dave was right Everything is based on that assumption this entire list And yet the VoigtKampff Altered Scale has only been administered to the first three the two Dave retired and then Polokov It was while Dave was administering the test thats when Polokov lasered him Which proves that Dave was right Rick said Otherwise he would not have been lasered Polokov would have no motive You get started for Seattle Bryant said Dont tell them first Ill handle it Listen He rose to his feet soberly confronted Rick When you run the VoigtKampff scale up there if one of the humans fails to pass it That cant happen Rick said One day a few weeks ago I talked with Dave about exactly that He had been thinking along the same lines I had a memo from the Soviet police WPO itself circulated throughout Earth plus the colonies A group of psychiatrists in Leningrad have approached WPO with the following proposition They want the latest and most accurate personality profile analytical tools used in determining the presence of an androidin other words the VoigtKampff scaleapplied to a carefully selected group of schizoid and schizophrenic human patients Those specifically which reveal whats called a flattening of affect Youve heard of that Rick said Thats specifically what the scale measures Then you understand what theyre worried about This problem has always existed Since we first encountered androids posing as humans The consensus of police opinion is known to you in Lurie Kampff s article written eight years ago Roletaking Blockage in the Undeteriorated Schizophrenic  Kampff compared the diminished emphatic faculty found in human mental patients and a superficially similar but basically The Leningrad psychiatrists Bryant broke in brusquely think that a small class of human beings could not pass the VoigtKampff scale If you tested them in line with police work youd assess them as humanoid robots Youd be wrong but by then theyd be dead He was silent now waiting for Ricks answer But these individuals Rick said would all be Theyd be in institutions Bryant agreed They couldnt conceivably function in the outside world they certainly couldnt go undetected as advanced psychoticsunless of course their breakdown had come recently and suddenly and no one had gotten around to noticing But this could happen  A million to one odds Rick said But he saw the point What worried Dave Bryant continued is this appearance of the new Nexus6 advance type The Rosen organization assured us as you know that a Nexus6 could be delineated by standard profile tests We took their word for it Now were forced as we knew we would be to determine it on our own Thats what youll be doing in Seattle You understand dont you that this could go wrong either way If you cant pick out all the humanoid robots then we have no reliable analytical tool and well never find the ones whore already escaping If your scale factors out a human subject identifies him as android Bryant beamed at him icily It would be awkward although no one absolutely not the Rosen people will make the news public Actually well be able to sit on it indefinitely although of course well have to inform WPO and they in turn will notify Leningrad Eventually itll pop out of the papes at us But by then we may have developed a better scale He picked the phone up You want to get started Use a department car and fuel yourself at our pumps Standing Rick said Can I take Dave Holdens notes with me I want to read them along the way Bryant said Lets wait until youve tried out your scale in Seattle His tone was interestingly merciless and Rick Deckard noted it When he landed the police department hovercar on the roof of the Rosen Association Building in Seattle he found a young woman waiting for him Blackhaired and slender wearing the new huge dustfiltering glasses she approached his car her hands deep in the pockets of her brightly striped long coat She had on her sharply defined small face an expression of sullen distaste Whats the matter Rick said as he stepped from the parked car The girl said obliquely Oh I dont know Something about the way we got talked to on the phone It doesnt matter Abruptly she held out her hand he reflexively took it Im Rachael Rosen I guess youre Mr Deckard This is not my idea he said Yes Inspector Bryant told us that But youre officially the San Francisco Police Department and it doesnt believe our unit is to the public benefit She eyed him from beneath long black lashes probably artificial Rick said A humanoid robot is like any other machine it can fluctuate between being a benefit and a hazard very rapidly As a benefit its not our problem But as a hazard Rachael Rosen said then you come in Is it true Mr Deckard that youre a bounty hunter He shrugged with reluctance nodded You have no difficulty viewing an android as inert the girl said So you can retire it as they say Do you have the group selected out for me he said Id like to He broke off Because all at once he had seen their animals A powerful corporation he realized would of course be able to afford this In the back of his mind evidently he had anticipated such a collection it was not surprise that he felt but more a sort of yearning He quietly walked away from the girl toward the closest pen Already he could smell them the several scents of the creatures standing or sitting or in the case of what appeared to be a raccoon asleep Never in his life had he personally seen a raccoon He knew the animal only from 3D films shown on television For some reason the dust had struck that species almost as hard as it had the birdsof which almost none survived now In an automatic response he brought out his muchthumbed Sidneys and looked up raccoon with all the sublistings The list prices naturally appeared in italics like Percheron horses none existed on the market for sale at any figure Sidneys catalogue simply listed the price at which the last transaction involving a raccoon had taken place It was astronomical His name is Bill the girl said from behind him Bill the raccoon We acquired him just last year from a subsidiary corporation She pointed past him and he then perceived the armed company guards standing with their machine guns the rapidfire little light Skoda issue the eyes of the guards had been fastened on him since his car landed And he thought my car is clearly marked as a police vehicle A major manufacturer of androids he said thoughtfully invests its surplus capital on living animals Look at the owl Rachael Rosen said Here Ill wake it up for you She started toward a small distant cage in the center of which jutted up a branching dead tree There are no owls he started to say Or so weve been told Sidneys he thought they list it in their catalogue as extinct the tiny precise type the E  again and again throughout the catalogue As the girl walked ahead of him he checked to see and he was right Sidneys never makes a mistake he said to himself We know that too What else can we depend on Its artificial he said with sudden realization his disappointment welled up keen and intense No She smiled and he saw that she had small even teeth as white as her eyes and hair were black But Sidneys listing he said trying to show her the catalogue To prove it to her The girl said We dont buy from Sidneys or from any animal dealer All our purchases are from private parties and the prices we pay arent reported She added Also we have our own naturalists theyre now working up in Canada Theres still a good deal of forest left comparatively speaking anyhow Enough for small animals and once in a while a bird For a long time he stood gazing at the owl who dozed on its perch A thousand thoughts came into his mind thoughts about the war about the days when owls had fallen from the sky he remembered how in his childhood it had been discovered that species upon species had become extinct and how the papes had reported it each dayfoxes one morning badgers the next until people had stopped reading the perpetual animal obits He thought too about his need for a real animal within him an actual hatred once more manifested itself toward his electric sheep which he had to tend had to care about as if it lived The tyranny of an object he thought It doesnt know I exist Like the androids it had no ability to appreciate the existence of another He had never thought of this before the similarity between an electric animal and an andy The electric animal he pondered could be considered a subform of the other a kind of vastly inferior robot Or conversely the android could be regarded as a highly developed evolved version of the ersatz animal Both viewpoints repelled him If you sold your owl he said to the girl Rachael Rosen how much would you want for it and how much of that down We would never sell our owl She scrutinized him with a mixture of pleasure and pity or so he read her expression And even if we sold it you couldnt possibly pay the price What kind of animal do you have at home A sheep he said A blackfaced Suffolk ewe Well then you should be happy Im happy he answered Its just that I always wanted an owl even back before they all dropped dead He corrected himself All but yours Rachael said Our present crash program and overall planning call for us to obtain an additional owl which can nate with Scrappy She indicated the owl dozing on its perch it had briefly opened both eyes yellow slits which healed over as the owl settled back down to resume its slumber Its chest rose conspicuously and fell as if the owl in its hypnagogic state had sighed Breaking away from the sightk made absolute bitterness blend throughout his prior reaction of awe and yearninghe said Id like to test out the selection now Can we go downstairs  My uncle took the call from your superior and by now he probably has Youre a family Rick broke in A corporation this large is a family affair Continuing her sentence Rachael said Uncle Eldon should have an android group and a control group set up by now So lets go She strode toward the elevator hands again thrust violently in the pockets of her coat she did not look back and he hesitated for a moment feeling annoyance before he at last trailed after her What have you got against me he asked her as together they descended She reflected as if up to now she hadnt known Well she said you a little police department employee are in a unique position Know what I mean She gave him a malicefilled sidelong glance How much of your current output he asked consists of types equipped with the Nexus6 All Rachael said Im sure the VoigtKampff scale will work with them And if it doesnt well have to withdraw all Nexus6 types from the market Her black eyes flamed up she glowered at him as the elevator ceased descending and its doors slid back Because you police departments cant do an adequate job in the simple matter of detecting the minuscule number of Nexus6s who balk A man dapper and lean and elderly approached them hand extended on his face a harried expression showed as if everything recently had begun happening too fast Im Eldon Rosen he explained to Rick as they shook hands Listen Deckard you realize we dont manufacture anything here on Earth right We cant just phone down to production and ask for a diverse flock of items its not that we dont want or intend to cooperate with you Anyhow Ive done the best I can His left hand shakily roved through his thinning hair Indicating his department briefcase Rick said Im ready to start The senior Rosens nervousness buoyed up his own confidence Theyre afraid of me he realized with a start Rachael Rosen included I can probably force them to abandon manufacture of their Nexus6 types what I do during the next hour will affect the structure of their operation It could conceivably determine the future of the Rosen Association here in the United States in Russia and on Mars The two members of the Rosen family studied him apprehensively and he felt the hollowness of their manner by coming here he had brought the void to them had ushered in emptiness and the hush of economic death They control inordinate power he thought This enterprise is considered one of the systems industrial pivots the manufacture of androids in fact has become so linked to the colonization effort that if one dropped into ruin so would the other in time The Rosen Association naturally understood this perfectly Eldon Rosen had obviously been conscious of it since Harry Bryants call I wouldnt worry if I were you Rick said as the two Rosens led him down a highly illuminated wide corridor He himself felt quietly content This moment more than any other which he could remember pleased him Well they would all soon know what his testing apparatus could accomplishand could not If you have no confidence in the VoigtKampff scale he pointed out possibly your organization should have researched an alternate test It can be argued that the responsibility rests partly on you Oh thanks The Rosens had steered him from the corridor and into a chic living roomish cubicle furnished with carpeting lamps couch and modern little endtables on which rested recent magazines  including he noticed the February supplement to the Sidneys catalogue which he personally had not seen In fact the February supplement wouldnt be out for another three days Obviously the Rosen Association had a special relationship with Sidneys Annoyed he picked up the supplement This is a violation of public trust Nobody should get advance news of price changes As a matter of fact this might violate a federal statute he tried to remember the relevant law found he could not Im taking this with me he said and opening his briefcase dropped the supplement within After an interval of silence Eldon Rosen said wearily Look officer it hasnt been our policy to solicit advance Im not a peace officer Rick said Im a bounty hunter From his opened briefcase he fished out the VoigtKampff apparatus seated himself at a nearby rosewood coffee table and began to assemble the rather simple polygraphic instruments You may send the first testee in he informed Eldon Rosen who now looked more haggard than ever Id like to watch Rachael said also seating herself Ive never seen an empathy test being administered What do those things you have there measure Rick said Thishe held up the flat adhesive disk with its trailing wiresmeasures capillary dilation in the facial area We know this to be a primary autonomic response the socalled shame or blushing reaction to a morally shocking stimulus It cant be controlled voluntarily as can skin conductivity respiration and cardiac rate He showed her the other instrument a pencilbeam light This records fluctuations of tension within the eye muscles Simultaneous with the blush phenomenon there generally can be found a small but detectable movement of And these cant be found in androids Rachael said Theyre not engendered by the stimuliquestions no Although biologically they exist Potentially Rachael said Give me the test Why Rick said puzzled Speaking up Eldon Rosen said hoarsely We selected her as your first subject She may be an android Were hoping you can tell He seated himself in a series of clumsy motions got out a cigarette lit it and fixedly watched CHAPTER 5 The small beam of white light shone steadily into the left eye of Rachael Rosen and against her cheek the wiremesh disk adhered She seemed calm Seated where he could catch the readings on the two gauges of the VoigtKampff testing apparatus Rick Deckard said Im going to outline a number of social situations You are to express your reaction to each as quickly as possible You will be timed of course And of course Rachael said distantly my verbal responses wont count Its solely the eyemuscle and capillary reaction that youll use as indices But Ill answer I want to go through this and She broke off Go ahead Mr Deckard Rick selecting question three said You are given a calfskin wallet on your birthday Both gauges immediately registered past the green and onto the red the needles swung violently and then subsided I wouldnt accept it Rachael said Also Id report the person who gave it to me to the police After making a jot of notation Rick continued turning to the eighth question of the VoigtKampff profile scale You have a little boy and he shows you his butterfly collection including his killing jar Id take him to the doctor Rachaels voice was low but firm Again the twin gauges registered but this time not so far He made a note of that too Youre sitting watching TV he continued and suddenly you discover a wasp crawling on your wrist Rachael said Id kill it The gauges this time registered almost nothing only a feeble and momentary tremor He noted that and hunted cautiously for the next question In a magazine you come across a fullpage color picture of a nude girl He paused Is this testing whether Im an android Rachael asked tartly or whether Im homosexual The gauges did not register He continued Your husband likes the picture Still the gauges failed to indicate a reaction The girl he added is lying face down on a large and beautiful bearskin rug The gauges remained inert and he said to himself An android response Failing to detect the major element the dead animal pelt Heritsmind is concentrating on other factors Your husband hangs the picture up on the wall of his study he finished and this time the needles moved I certainly wouldnt let him Rachael said Okay he said nodding Now consider this Youre reading a novel written in the old days before the war The characters are visiting Fishermans Wharf in San Francisco They become hungry and enter a seafood restaurant One of them orders lobster and the chef drops the lobster into the tub of boiling water while the characters watch Oh god Rachael said Thats awful Did they really do that Its depraved You mean a live lobster The gauges however did not respond Formally a correct response But simulated You rent a mountain cabin he said in an area still verdant Its rustic knotty pine with a huge fireplace Yes Rachael said nodding impatiently On the walls someone has hung old maps Currier and Ives prints and above the fireplace a deers head has been mounted a full stag with developed horns The people with you admire the decor of the cabin and you all decide Not with the deer head Rachael said The gauges however showed an amplitude within the green only You become pregnant Rick continued by a man who has promised to marry you The man goes off with another woman your best friend you get an abortion and I would never get an abortion Rachael said Anyhow you cant Its a life sentence and the police are always watching This time both needles swung violently into the red How do you know that Rick asked her curiously About the difficulty of obtaining an abortion Everybody knows that Rachael answered It sounded like you spoke from personal experience He watched the needles intently they still swept out a wide path across the dials One more Youre dating a man and he asks you to visit his apartment While youre there he offers you a drink As you stand holding your glass you see into the bedroom its attractively decorated with bullfight posters and you wander in to look closer He follows after you closing the door Putting his arm around you he says Rachael interrupted Whats a bullfight poster Drawings usually in color and very large showing a matador with his cape a bull trying to gore him He was puzzled How old are you he asked that might be a factor Im eighteen Rachael said Okay so this man closes the door and puts his arm around me What does he say Rick said Do you know how bullfights ended I suppose somebody got hurt The bull at the end was always killed He waited watching the two needles They palpitated restlessly nothing more No real reading at all A final question he said Twopart You are watching an old movie on TV a movie from before the war It shows a banquet in progress the guests are enjoying raw oysters Ugh Rachael said the needles swung swiftly The entree he continued consists of boiled dog stuffed with rice The needles moved less this time less than they had for the raw oysters Are raw oysters more acceptable to you than a dish of boiled dog Evidently not He put his pencil down shut off the beam of light removed the adhesive patch from her check Youre an android he said Thats the conclusion of the testing he informed heror rather itand Eldon Rosen who regarded him with writhing worry the elderly mans face contorted shifted plastically with angry concern Im right arent I Rick said There was no answer from either of the Rosens Look he said reasonably We have no conflict of interest its important to me that the VoigtKampff test functions almost as important as it is to you The elder Rosen said Shes not an android I dont believe it Rick said Why would he lie Rachael said to Rick fiercely If anything wed lie the other way I want a bone marrow analysis made of you Rick said to her It can eventually be organically determined whether youre android or not its slow and painful admittedly but Legally Rachael said I cant be forced to undergo a bone marrow test Thats been established in the courts selfincrimination And anyhow on a live personnot the corpse of a retired androidit takes a long time You can give that damn VoigtKampff profile test because of the specials they have to be tested for constantly and while the government was doing that you police agencies slipped the VoigtKampff through But what you said is true thats the end of the testing She rose to her feet paced away from him and stood with her hands on her hips her back to him The issue is not the legality of the bone marrow analysis Eldon Rosen said huskily The issue is that your empathy delineation test failed in response to my niece I can explain why she scored as an android might Rachael grew up aboard Salander 3  She was born on it she spent fourteen of her eighteen years living off its tape library and what the nine other crew members all adults knew about Earth Then as you know the ship turned back a sixth of the way to Proxima Otherwise Rachael would never have seen Earthanyhow not until her later life You would have retired me Rachael said over her shoulder In a police dragnet I would have been killed Ive known that since I got here four years ago this isnt the first time the VoigtKampff test has been given to me In fact I rarely leave this building the risk is enormous because of those roadblocks you police set up those flying wedge spot checks to pick up unclassified specials And androids Eldon Rosen added Although naturally the public isnt told that theyre not supposed to know that androids are on Earth in our midst I dont think they are Rick said I think the various police agencies here and in the Soviet Union have gotten them all The population is small enough now everyone sooner or later runs into a random checkpoint That anyhow was the idea What were your instructions Eldon Rosen asked if you wound up designating a human as android Thats a departmental matter He began restoring his testing gear to his briefcase the two Rosens watched silently Obviously he added I was told to cancel further testing as Im now doing If it failed once theres no point in going on He snapped the briefcase shut We could have defrauded you Rachael said Nothing forced us to admit you mistested me And the same for the other nine subjects weve selected She gestured vigorously All we had to do was simply go along with your test results either way Rick said I would have insisted on a list in advance A sealedenvelope breakdown And compared my own test results for congruity There would have had to be congruity And I can see now he realized that I wouldnt have gotten it Bryant was right Thank god I didnt go out bounty hunting on the basis of this test Yes I suppose you would have done that Eldon Rosen said He glanced at Rachael who nodded We discussed that possibility Eldon said then with reluctance This problem Rick said stems entirely from your method of operation Mr Rosen Nobody forced your organization to evolve the production of humanoid robots to a point where We produced what the colonists wanted Eldon Rosen said We followed the time honored principle underlying every commercial venture If our firm hadnt made these progressively more human types other firms in the field would have We knew the risk we were taking when we developed the Nexus6 brain unit But your VoigtKampff test was a failure before we released that type of android  If you had failed to classify a Nexus6 android as an android if you had checked it out as humanbut thats not what happened His voice had become hard and bitingly penetrating Your police departmentothers as wellmay have retired very probably have retired authentic humans with underdeveloped empathic ability such as my innocent niece here Your position Mr Deckard is extremely bad morally Ours isnt In other words Rick said with acuity Im not going to be given a chance to check out a single Nexus6 You people dropped this schizoid girl on me beforehand And my test he realized is wiped out I shouldnt have gone for it he said to himself However its too late now We have you Mr Deckard Rachael Rosen agreed in a quiet reasonable voice she turned toward him then and smiled He could not make out even now how the Rosen Association had managed to snare him and so easily Experts he realized A mammoth corporation like thisit embodies too much experience It possesses in fact a sort of group mind And Eldon and Rachael Rosen consisted of spokesmen for that corporate entity His mistake evidently had been in viewing them as individuals It was a mistake he would not make again Your superior Mr Bryant Eldon Rosen said will have difficulty understanding how you happened to let us void your testing apparatus before the test began He pointed toward the ceiling and Rick saw the camera lens His massive error in dealing with the Rosens had been recorded I think the right thing for us all to do Eldon said is sit down and He gestured affably We can work something out Mr Deckard Theres no need for anxiety The Nexus6 variety of android is a fact we here at the Rosen Association recognize it and I think now you do too Rachael leaning toward Rick said How would you like to own an owl I doubt if Ill ever own an owl But he knew what she meant he understood the business the Rosen Association wanted to transact Tension of a kind he had never felt before manifested itself inside him it exploded leisurely in every part of his body He felt the tension the consciousness of what was happening take over completely But an owl Eldon Rosen said is the thing you want He glanced at his niece inquiringly I dont think he has any idea Of course he does Rachael contradicted He knows exactly where this is heading Dont you Mr Deckard Again she leaned toward him and this time closer he could smell a mild perfume about her almost a warmth Youre practically there Mr Deckard You practically have your owl To Eldon Rosen she said Hes a bounty hunter remember So he lives off the bounty he makes not his salary Isnt that so Mr Deckard He nodded How many androids escaped this time Rachael inquired Presently he said Eight Originally Two have already been retired by someone else not me You get how much for each android Rachael asked Shrugging he said It varies Rachael said If you have no test you can administer then there is no way you can identify an android And if theres no way you can identify an android theres no way you can collect your bounty So if the VoigtKampff scale has to be abandoned A new scale Rick said will replace it This has happened before Three times to be exact But the new scale the more modern analytical device had been there already no lag had existed This time was different Eventually of course the VoigtKampff scale will become obsolete Rachael agreed But not now Were satisfied ourselves that it will delineate the Nexus6 types and wed like you to proceed on that basis in your own particular peculiar work Rocking back and forth her arms tightly folded she regarded him with intensity Trying to fathom his reaction Tell him he can have his owl Eldon Rosen grated You can have the owl Rachael said still eyeing him The one up on the roof Scrappy But we will want to mate it if we can get our hands on a male And any offspring will be ours that has to be absolutely understood Rick said Ill divide the brood No Rachael said instantly behind her Eldon Rosen shook his head backing her up That way youd have claim to the sole bloodline of owls for the rest of eternity And theres another condition You cant will your owl to anybody at your death it reverts back to the association That sounds Rick said like an invitation for you to come in and kill me To get your owl back immediately I wont agree to that its too dangerous Youre a bounty hunter Rachael said You can handle a laser gunin fact youre carrying one right now If you cant protect yourself how are you going to retire the six remaining Nexus6 andys Theyre a good deal smarter than the Grozzi Corporations old W4 But I hunt them  he said This way with a reversion clause on the owl someone would be hunting me And he did not like the idea of being stalked he had seen the effect on androids It brought about certain notable changes even in them Rachael said All right well yield on that You can will the owl to your heirs But we insist on getting the complete brood If you cant agree to that go on back to San Francisco and admit to your superiors in the department that the VoigtKampff scale at least as administered by you cant distinguish an andy from a human being And then look for another job Give me some time Rick said Okay Rachael said Well leave you in here where its comfortable She examined her wristwatch Half an hour Eldon Rosen said He and Rachael filed toward the door of the room silently They had said what they intended to say he realized the rest lay in his lap As Rachael started to close the door after herself and her uncle Rick said starkly You managed to set me up perfectly You have it on tape that I missed on you you know that my job depends on the use of the VoigtKampff scale and you own that goddamn owl Your owl dear Rachael said Remember Well tie your home address around its leg and have it fly down to San Francisco itll meet you there when you get off work It he thought She keeps calling the owl it  Not her Just a second he said Pausing at the door Rachael said Youve decided I want he said opening his briefcase to ask you one more question from the VoigtKampff scale Sit down again Rachael glanced at her uncle he nodded and she grudgingly returned seating herself as before Whats this for she demanded her eyebrows lifted in distasteand wariness He perceived her skeletal tension noted it professionally Presently he had the pencil of light trained on her right eye and the adhesive patch again in contact with her check Rachael stared into the light rigidly the expression of extreme distaste still manifest My briefcase Rick said as he rummaged for the VoigtKampff forms Nice isnt it Department issue Well well Rachael said remotely Babyhide Rick said He stroked the black leather surface of the briefcase One hundred percent genuine human babyhide He saw the two dial indicators gyrate frantically But only after a pause The reaction had come but too late He knew the reaction period down to a fraction of a second the correct reaction period there should have been none Thanks Miss Rosen he said and gathered together the equipment again he had concluded his retesting Thats all Youre leaving Rachael asked Yes he said Im satisfied Cautiously Rachael said What about the other nine subjects The scale has been adequate in your case he answered I can extrapolate from that its clearly still effective To Eldon Rosen who slumped morosely by the door of the room he said Does she know Sometimes they didnt false memories had been tried various times generally in the mistaken idea that through them reactions to testing would be altered Eldon Rosen said No We programmed her completely But I think toward the end she suspected To the girl he said You guessed when he asked for one more try Pale Rachael nodded fixedly Dont be afraid of him Eldon Rosen told her Youre not an escaped android on Earth illegally youre the property of the Rosen Association used as a sales device for prospective emigrants He walked to the girl put his hand comfortingly on her shoulder at the touch the girl flinched Hes right Rick said Im not going to retire you Miss Rosen Good day He started toward the door then halted briefly To the two of them he said is the owl genuine Rachael glanced swiftly at the elder Rosen Hes leaving anyhow Eldon Rosen said It doesnt matter the owl is artificial There are no owls Hmm Rick muttered and stepped numbly out into the corridor The two of them watched him go Neither said anything Nothing remained to say So thats how the largest manufacturer of androids operates Rick said to himself Devious and in a manner he had never encountered before A weird and convoluted new personality type no wonder law enforcement agencies were having trouble with the Nexus6 The Nexus6 He had now come up against it Rachael he realized she must be a Nexus6  Im seeing one of them for the first time And they damn near did it they came awfully damn close to undermining the VoigtKampff scale the only method we have for detecting them The Rosen Association does a good jobmakes a good try anyhowat protecting its products And I have to face six more of them he reflected Before Im finished He would earn the bounty money Every cent Assuming he made it through alive CHAPTER 6 The TV set boomed descending the great empty apartment buildings duststricken stairs to the level below John Isidore made out now the familiar voice of Buster Friendly burbling happily to his systemwide vast audience ho ho folks Zip click zip Time for a brief note on tomorrows weather first the Eastern seaboard of the USA Mongoose satellite reports that fallout will be especially pronounced toward noon and then will taper off So all you dear folks wholl be venturing out ought to wait until afternoon eh And speaking of waiting its now only ten hours til that big piece of news my special exposé Tell your friends to watch Im revealing something thatll amaze you Now you might guess that its just the usual As Isidore knocked on the apartment door the television died immediately into nonbeing It had not merely become silent it had stopped existing scared into its grave by his knock He sensed behind the closed door the presence of life beyond that of the TV His straining faculties manufactured or else picked up a haunted tongueless fear by someone retreating from him someone blown back to the farthest wall of the apartment in an attempt to evade him Hey he called I live upstairs I heard your TV Lets meet okay He waited listening No sound and no motion his words had not pried the person loose I brought you a cube of margarine he said standing close to the door in an effort to speak through its thickness My names J R Isidore and I work for the wellknown animal vet Mr Hannibal Sloat youve heard of him Im reputable I have a job I drive Mr Sloats truck The door meagerly opened and he saw within the apartment a fragmented and misaligned shrinking figure a girl who cringed and slunk away and yet held onto the door as if for physical support Fear made her seem ill it distorted her body lines made her appear as if someone had broken her and then with malice patched her together badly Her eyes enormous glazed over fixedly as she attempted to smile He said with sudden understanding You thought no one lived in this building You thought it was abandoned Nodding the girl whispered Yes But Isidore said its good to have neighbors Heck until you came along I didnt have any And that was no fun god knew Youre the only one the girl asked In this building besides me She seemed less timid now her body straightened and with her hand she smoothed her dark hair Now he saw that she had a nice figure although small and nice eyes markedly established by long black lashes Caught by surprise the girl wore pajama bottoms and nothing more And as he looked past her he perceived a room in disorder Suitcases lay here and there opened their contents half spilled onto the littered floor But this was natural she had barely arrived Im the only one besides you Isidore said And I wont bother you He felt glum his offering possessing the quality of an authentic old prewar ritual had not been accepted In fact the girl did even seem aware of it Or maybe she did not understand what a cube of margarine was for He had that intuition the girl seemed more bewildered than anything else Out of her depth and helplessly floating in nowreceding circles of fear Good old Buster he said trying to reduce her rigid postural stance You like him I watch him every morning and then again at night when I get home I watch him while Im eating dinner and then his late late show until I go to bed At least until my TV set broke Who the girl began and then broke off she bit her lip as if savagely angry Evidently at herself Buster Friendly he explained It seemed odd to him that this girl had never heard of Earths most kneeslapping TV comic Where did you come here from  he asked curiously I dont see that it matters She shot a swift glance upward at him Something that she saw seemed to ease her concern her body noticeably relaxed Ill be glad to receive company she said later on when Im more moved in Right now of course its out of the question Why out of the question He was puzzled everything about her puzzled him Maybe he thought Ive been living here alone too long Ive become strange They say chickenheads are like that The thought made him feel even more glum I could help you unpack he ventured the door now had virtually shut in his face And your furniture The girl said I have no furniture All these thingsshe indicated the room behind herthey were here They wont do Isidore said He could tell that at a glance The chairs the carpet the tablesall had rotted away they sagged in mutual ruin victims of the despotic force of time And of abandonment No one had lived in this apartment for years the ruin had become almost complete He couldnt imagine how she figured on living in such surroundings Listen he said earnestly If we go all over the building looking we can probably find you things that arent so tattered A lamp from one apartment a table from another Ill do it the girl said Myself thanks Youd go into those apartments alone  He could not believe it Why not Again she shuddered nervously grimacing in awareness of saying something wrong Isidore said Ive tried it Once After that I just come home and go in my own place and I dont think about the rest The apartments in which no one liveshundreds of them and all full of the possessions people had like family photographs and clothes Those that died couldnt take anything and those who emigrated didnt want to This building except for my apartment is completely kippleized Kippleized She did not comprehend Kipple is useless objects like junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers or yesterdays homeopape When nobodys around kipple reproduces itself For instance if you go to bed leaving any kipple around your apartment when you wake up the next morning theres twice as much of it It always gets more and more I see The girl regarded him uncertainly not knowing whether to believe him Not sure if he meant it seriously Theres the First Law of Kipple he said Kipple drives out nonkipple Like Greshams law about bad money And in these apartments theres been nobody there to fight the kipple So it has taken over completely the girl finished She nodded Now I understand Your place here he said this apartment youve pickedits too kippleized to live in We can roll the kipplefactor back we can do like I said raid the other apts But He broke off But what Isidore said We cant win Why not The girl stepped into the hall closing the door behind her arms folded selfconsciously before her small high breasts she faced him eager to understand Or so it appeared to him anyhow She was at least listening No one can win against kipple he said except temporarily and maybe in one spot like in my apartment Ive sort of created a stasis between the pressure of kipple and nonkipple for the time being But eventually Ill die or go away and then the kipple will again take over Its a universal principle operating throughout the universe the entire universe is moving toward a final state of total absolute kippleization He added Except of course for the upward climb of Wilbur Mercer The girl eyed him I dont see any relation Thats what Mercerism is all about Again he found himself puzzled Dont you participate in fusion Dont you own an empathy box After a pause the girl said carefully I didnt bring mine with me I assumed Id find one here But an empathy box he said stammering in his excitement is the most personal possession you have Its an extension of your body its the way you touch other humans its the way you stop being alone But you know that Everybody knows that Mercer even lets people like me He broke off But too late he had already told her and he could see by her face by the flicker of sudden aversion that she knew I almost passed the IQ test he said in a low shaky voice Im not very special only moderately not like some you see But thats what Mercer doesnt care about As far as Im concerned the girl said you can count that as a major objection to Mercerism Her voice was clean and neutral she intended only to state a fact he realized The fact of her attitude toward chickenheads I guess Ill go back upstairs he said and started away from her his cube of margarine clutched it had become plastic and damp from the squeeze of his hand The girl watched him go still with the neutral expression on her face And then she called Wait Turning he said Why Ill need you For getting myself adequate furniture From other apartments as you said She strolled toward him her bare upper body sleek and trim without an excess gram of far What time do you get home from work You can help me then Isidore said Could you maybe fix dinner for us If I brought home the ingredients No I have too much to do The girl shook off the request effortlessly and he noticed that perceived it without understanding it Now that her initial fear had diminished something else had begun to emerge from her Something more strange And he thought deplorable A coldness Like he thought a breath from the vacuum between inhabited worlds in fact from nowhere it was not what she did or said but what she did not do and say Some other time the girl said and moved back toward her apartment door Did you get my name he said eagerly John Isidore and I work for You told me who you work for She had stopped briefly at her door pushing it open she said Some incredible person named Hannibal Sloat who Im sure doesnt exist outside your imagination My name is She gave him one last warmthless glance as she returned to her apartment hesitated and said Im Rachael Rosen Of the Rosen Association he asked The systems largest manufacturer of humanoid robots used in our colonization program A complicated expression instantly crossed her face fleetingly gone at once No she said I never heard of them I dont know anything about it More of your chickenbead imagination I suppose John Isidore and his personal private empathy box Poor Mr Isidore But your name suggests My name the girt said is Pris Stratton Thats my married name I always use it I never use any other name but Pris You can call me Pris She reflected then said No youd better address me as Miss Stratton Because we dont really know each other At least I dont know you The door shut after her and he found himself alone in the duststrewn dim hall CHAPTER 7 Well so it goes J R Isidore thought as he stood clutching his soft cube of margarine Maybe shell change her mind about letting me call her Pris And possibly if I can pick up a can of prewar vegetables about dinner too But maybe she doesnt know how to cook he thought suddenly Okay I can do it Ill fix dinner for both of us And Ill show her how so she can do it in the future if she wants Shell probably want to once I show her how as near as I can make out most women even young ones like her like to cook its an instinct Ascending the darkened stairs he returned to his own apartment Shes really out of touch he thought as he donned his white work uniform even if he hurried hed be late to work and Mr Sloat would be angry but so what For instance shes never beard of Buster Friendly And thats impossible Buster is the most important human being alive except of course for Wilbur Mercer  but Mercer he reflected isnt a human being he evidently is an archetypal entity from the stars superimposed on our culture by a cosmic template At least thats what Ive heard people say thats what Mr Sloat says for instance And Hannibal Sloat would know Odd that she isnt consistent about her own name he pondered She may need help Can I give her any help he asked himself A special a chickenhead what do I know I cant marry and I cant emigrate and the dust will eventually kill me I have nothing to offer Dressed and ready to go he left his apartment ascended to the roof where his battered used hovercar lay parked An hour later in the company track he had picked up the first malfunctioning animal for the day An electric cat it lay in the plastic dustproof carrying cage in the rear of the truck and panted erratically Youd almost think it was real Isidore observed as he headed back to the Van Ness Pet Hospitalthat carefully misnamed little enterprise which barely existed in the tough competitive field of falseanimal repair The cat in its travail groaned Wow Isidore said to himself It really sounds as if its dying Maybe its tenyear battery has shorted and all its circuits are systematically burning out A major job Milt Borogrove Van Ness Pet Hospitals repairman would have his bands full And I didnt give the owner an estimate Isidore realized gloomily The guy simply thrust the cat at me said it had begun failing during the night and then I guess he took off for work Anyhow all of a sudden the momentary verbal exchange had ceased the cats owner had gone roaring up into the sky in his custom newmodel handsome hovercar And the man constituted a new customer To the cat Isidore said Can you hang on until we reach the shop The cat continued to wheeze Ill recharge you while were en route Isidore decided he dropped the truck toward the nearest available roof and there temporarily parked with the motor running crawled into the back of the truck and opened the plastic dustproof carrying cage which in conjunction with his own white suit and the name on the truck created a total impression of a true animal vet picking up a true animal The electric mechanism within its compellingly authentic style gray pelt gurgled and blew bubbles its vidlenses glassy its metal jaws locked together This had always amazed him these disease circuits built into false animals the construct which he now held on his lap had been put together in such a fashion that when a primary component misfired the whole thing appearednot brokenbut organically ill It would have fooled me Isidore said to himself as he groped within the ersatz stomach fur for the concealed control panel quite small on this variety of false animal plus the quickcharge battery terminals He could find neither Nor could he search very long the mechanism had almost failed If it does consist of a short he reflected which is busy burning out circuits then maybe I should try to detach one of the battery cables the mechanism will shut down but no more harm will be done And then in the shop Milt can charge it back up Deftly he ran his fingers along the pseudo bony spine The cables should be about here Damn expert workmanship so absolutely perfect an imitation Cables not apparent even under close scrutiny Must be a Wheelright  Carpenter productthey cost more but look what good work they do He gave up the false cat had ceased functioning so evidently the shortif that was what ailed the thinghad finished off the power supply and basic drivetrain Thatll run into money he thought pessimistically Well the guy evidently hadnt been getting the threetimesyearly preventive cleaning and lubricating which made all the difference Maybe this would teach the ownerthe hard way Crawling back in the drivers seat he put the wheel into climb position buzzed up into the air once I more and resumed his flight back to the repair shop Anyhow he no longer had to listen to the nervewracking wheezing of the construct he could relax Funny he thought even though I know rationally its faked the sound of a false animal burning out its drivetrain and power supply ties my stomach in knots I wish he thought painfully that I could get another job If I hadnt failed that IQ test I wouldnt be reduced to this ignominious task with its attendant emotional byproducts On the other hand the synthetic sufferings of false animals didnt bother Milt Borogrove or their boss Hannibal Sloat So maybe its I John Isidore said to himself Maybe when you deteriorate back down the ladder of evolution as I have when you sink into the tomb world slough of being a specialwell best to abandon that line of inquiry Nothing depressed him more than the moments in which he contrasted his current mental powers with what he had formerly possessed Every day he declined in sagacity and vigor He and the thousands of other specials throughout Terra all of them moving toward the ash heap Turning into living Ripple For company he clicked on the trucks radio and tuned for Buster Friendlys aud show which Eke the TV version continued twentythree unbroken warm hours a day  the additional one hour being a religious signoff ten minutes of silence and then a religious signon glad to have you on the show again Buster Friendly was saying Lets see Amanda its been two whole days since weve visited with you Starting on any new pics dear Veil I vuz goink to do a pic yestooday baht vell dey vanted me to staht ad seven Seven AM Buster Friendly broke in Yess dots right  Booster it vuz seven hey hem Amanda Werner laughed her famous laugh nearly as imitated as Busters Amanda Werner and several other beautiful elegant conically breasted foreign ladies from unspecified vaguely defined countries plus a few bucolic socalled humorists comprised Busters perpetual core of repeats Women like Amanda Werner never made movies never appeared in plays they lived out their queer beautiful lives as guests on Busters unending show appearing Isidore had once calculated as much as seventy hours a week How did Buster Friendly find the time to tape both his aud and vid shows Isidore wondered And how did Amanda Werner find time to be a guest every other day month after month year after year How did they keep talking They never repeated themselvesnot so far as he could determine Their remarks always witty always new werent rehearsed Amandas hair glowed her eyes glinted her teeth shone she never ran down never became tired never found herself at a loss as to a clever retort to Busters bangbang string of quips jokes and sharp observations The Buster Friendly Show telecast and broadcast over all Earth via satellite also poured down on the emigrants of the colony planets Practice transmissions beamed to Proxima had been attempted in case human colonization extended that far Had the Salander 3 reached its destination the travelers aboard would have found the Buster Friendly Show awaiting them And they would have been glad But something about Buster Friendly irritated John Isidore one specific thing In subtle almost inconspicuous ways Buster ridiculed the empathy boxes Not once but many times He was in fact doing it right now no rock nicks on me Buster prattled away to Amanda Werner And if Im going up the side of a mountain I want a couple of bottles of Budweiser beer along The studio audience laughed and Isidore heard a sprinkling of handclaps And Ill reveal my carefully documented exposé from up there that exposé coming exactly ten hours from now Ent me too dahiink  Amanda gushed Tek me wit you I go alonk en ven dey trow a rock et us I protek you  Again the audience howled and John Isidore felt baffled and impotent rage seep up into the back of his neck Why did Buster Friendly always chip away at Mercerism No one else seemed bothered by it even the UN approved And the American and Soviet police had publicly stated that Mercerism reduced crime by making citizens more concerned about the plight of their neighbors Mankind needs more empathy Titus Corning the U N Secretary General had declared several times Maybe Buster is jealous Isidore conjectured Sure that would explain it he and Wilbur Mercer are in competition But for what Our minds Isidore decided Theyre fighting for control of our psychic selves the empathy box on one hand Busters guffaws and offthecuff jibes on the other Ill have to tell Hannibal Sloat that he decided Ask him if its true hell know When he had parked his truck on the roof of the Van Ness Pet Hospital he quickly carried the plastic cage containing the inert false cat downstairs to Hannibal Sloats office As he entered Mr Sloat glanced up from a partsinventory page his gray seamed face rippling like troubled water Too old to emigrate Hannibal Sloat although not a special was doomed to creep out his remaining life on Earth The dust over the years had eroded him it had left his features gray his thoughts gray it had shrunk him and made his legs spindly and his gait unsteady He saw the world through glasses literally dense with dust For some reason Sloat never cleaned his glasses It was as if he had given up he had accepted the radioactive dirt and it had begun its job long ago of burying him Already it obscured his sight In the few years he had remaining it would corrupt his other senses until at last only his birdscreech voice would remain and then that would expire too What do you have there Mr Sloat asked A cat with a short in its power supply Isidore set the cage down on the documentlittered desk of his boss Why show it to me Sloat demanded Take it down in the shop to Milt However reflexively he opened the cage and tugged the false animal out Once he had been a repairman A very good one Isidore said I think Buster Friendly and Mercerism are fighting for control of our psychic souls If so Sloat said examining the cat Buster is winning Hes winning now Isidore said but ultimately hell lose Sloat lifted his bead peered at him Why Because Wilbur Mercer is always renewed Hes eternal At the top of the hill hes struck down he sinks into the tomb world but then he rises inevitably And us with him So were eternal too He felt good speaking so well usually around Mr Sloat he stammered Sloat said Buster is immortal like Mercer Theres no difference How can he he Hes a man I dont know Sloat said But its true Theyve never admitted it of course Is that how come Buster Friendly can do fortysix hours of show a day Thats right Sloat said What about Amanda Werner and those other women Theyre immortal too Are they a superior life form from another system Ive never been able to determine that for sure Mr Sloat said still examining the cat He now removed his dustfilmed glasses peered without them at the halfopen mouth As I have conclusively in the case of Wilbur Mercer he finished almost inaudibly He cursed then a string of abuse lasting what seemed to Isidore a full minute This cat Sloat said finally isnt false I knew sometime this would happen And its dead He stared down at the corpse of the cat And cursed again Wearing his grimy blue sailcloth apron burly pebbleskinned Milt Borogrove appeared at the office door Whats the matter he said Seeing the cat he entered the office and picked up the animal The chickenhead Sloat said brought it in Never before had he used that term in front of Isidore If it was still alive Milt said we could take it to a real animal vet I wonder what its worth Anybody got a copy of Sidneys  Ddoesnt yyyour insurance cccover this Isidore asked Mr Sloat Under him his legs wavered and he felt the room begin to turn dark maroon cast over with specks of green Yes Sloat said finally half snarling But its the waste that gets me The loss of one more living creature Couldnt you tell Isidore Didnt you notice the difference I thought Isidore managed to say it was a really good job So good it fooled me I mean it seemed alive and a job that good I dont think Isidore can tell the difference Milt said mildly To him theyre all alive false animals included He probably tried to save it To Isidore he said What did you do try to recharge its battery Or locate a short in it Yyes Isidore admitted It probably was so far gone it wouldnt have made it anyhow Milt said Let the chickenhead off the hook Han Hes got a point the fakes are beginning to be darn near real what with those disease circuits theyre building into the new ones And living animals do die thats one of the risks in owning them Were just not used to it because all we see are fakes The goddamn waste Sloat said According to Mmercer Isidore pointed Out aall life returns The cycle is cccomplete for aaanimals too I mean we all ascend with him die Tell that to the guy that owned this cat Mr Sloat said Not sure if his boss was serious Isidore said You mean I have to But you always handle vidcalls He had a phobia about the vidphone and found making a call especially to a stranger virtually impossible Mr Sloat of course knew this Dont make him Milt said Ill do it He reached for the receiver Whats his number Ive got it here somewhere Isidore fumbled in his work smock pockets Sloat said I want the chickenhead to do it I cccant use the vidphone Isidore protested his heart laboring Because Im hairy ugly dirty stooped snaggletoothed and gray And also I feel sick from the radiation I think Im going to die Milt smiled and said to Sloat I guess if I felt that way I wouldnt use the vidphone either Come on Isidore if you dont give me the owners number I cant make the call and youll have to He held out his hand amiably The chickenhead makes it Sloat said or hes fired He did not look either at Isidore or at Milt he glared fixedly forward Aw come on Milt protested Isidore said I dddont like to be cccalled a chickenhead I mean the dddust has dddone a lot to you too physically Although maybe nnnot your brain as in mmy case Im fired he realized I cant make the call And then all at once he remembered that the owner of the cat had zipped off to work There would be no one home I gguess I can call him he said as he fished out the tag with the information on it See  Mr Sloat said to Milt He can do it if he has to Seated at the vidphone receiver in hand Isidore dialed Yeah Milt said but he shouldnt have to And hes right the dust has affected you youre damn near blind and in a couple of years you wont be able to hear Sloat said Its got to you too Borogrove Your skin is the color of dog manure On the vidscreen a face appeared a mitteleuropaische somewhat carefullooking woman who wore her hair in a tight bun Yes she said Mmmrs Pilsen Isidore said terror spewing through him he had not thought of it naturally but the owner had a wife who of course was home I want to tttalk to you about your cccccc He broke off rubbed his chin ticwise Your cat Oh yes you picked up Horace Mrs Pilsen said Did it turn out to be pneumonitis Thats what Mr Pilsen thought Isidore said Your cat died Oh no god in heaven Well replace it he said We have insurance He glanced toward Mr Sloat he seemed to concur The owner of our firm Mr Hannibal Sloat He floundered Will personally No Sloat said well give them a check Sidneys list price will personally pick the replacement cat out for you Isidore found himself saying Having started a conversation which he could not endure he discovered himself unable to get back out What he was saying possessed an intrinsic logic which he had no means of halting it had to grind to its own conclusion Both Mr Sloat and Milt Borogrove stared at him as he rattled on Give us the specifications of the cat you desire Color sex subtype such as Manx Persian Abyssinian Horace is dead Mrs Pilsen said He had pneumonitis Isidore said He died on the trip to the hospital Our senior staff physician Dr Hannibal Sloat expressed the belief that nothing at this point could have saved him But isnt it fortunate Mrs Pilsen that were going to replace him Am I correct Mrs Pilsen tears appearing in her eyes said There is only one cat like Horace He used towhen he was just a kittenstand and stare up at us as if asking a question We never understood what the question was Maybe now he knows the answer Fresh tears appeared I guess we all will eventually An inspiration came to Isidore What about an exact electric duplicate of your cat We can have a superb handcrafted job by Wheelright  Carpenter in which every detail of the old animal is faithfully repeated in permanent Oh thats dreadful Mrs Pilsen protested What are you saying Dont tell my husband that dont suggest that to Ed or hell go mad He loved Horace more than any cat he ever had and hes had a cat since he was a child Taking the vidphone receiver from Isidore Milt said to the woman We can give you a check in the amount of Sidneys list or as Mr Isidore suggested we can pick out a new cat for you Were very sorry that your cat died but as Mr Isidore pointed out the cat had pneumonitis which is almost always fatal His tone rolled out professionally of the three of them at the Van Ness Pet Hospital Milt performed the best in the matter of business phone calls I cant tell my husband Mrs Pilsen said All right maam Milt said and grimaced slightly Well call him Would you give me his number at his place of employment He groped for a pen and pad of paper Mr Sloat handed them to him Listen Mrs Pilsen said she seemed now to rally Maybe the other gentleman is right Maybe I ought to commission an electric replacement of Horace but without Ed ever knowing could it be so faithful a reproduction that my husband wouldnt be able to tell Dubiously Milt said If thats what you want But its been our experience that the owner of the animal is never fooled Its only casual observers such as neighbors You see once you get real close to a false animal Ed never got physically close to Horace even though he loved him I was the one who took care of all Horaces personal needs such as his sandbox I think I would like to try a false animal and if it didnt work then you could find us a real cat to replace Horace I just dont want my husband to know I dont think he could live through it Thats why he never got close to Horace he was afraid to And when Horace got sickwith pneumonitis as you tell meEd got panicstricken and just wouldnt face it Thats why we waited so long to call you Too long  as I knew before you called I knew She nodded her tears under control now How long will it take Milt essayed We can have it ready in ten days Well deliver it during the day while your husband is at work He wound up the call said goodby and hung up Hell know he said to Mr Sloat In five seconds But thats what she wants Owners who get to love their animals Sloat said somberly go to pieces Im glad were not usually involved with real animals You realize that actual animal vets have to make calls like that all the time He contemplated John Isidore In some ways youre not so stupid after all Isidore You handled that reasonably well Even though Milt had to come in and take over He was doing fine Milt said God that was tough He picked up the dead Horace Ill take this down to the shop Han you phone Wheelright  Carpenter and get their builder over to measure and photograph it Im not going to let them take it to their shop I want to compare the replica myself I think Ill have Isidore talk to them Mr Sloat decided He got this started he ought to be able to deal with Wheelright  Carpenter after handling Mrs Pilsen Milt said to Isidore Just dont let them take the original He held up Horace Theyll want to because it makes their work a hell of a lot easier Be firm Um Isidore said blinking Okay Maybe I ought to call them now before it starts to decay Dont dead bodies decay or something He felt elated CHAPTER 8 After parking the departments speedy beefedup hovercar on the roof of the San Francisco Hall of Justice on Lombard Street bounty hunter Rick Deckard briefcase in hand descended to Harry Bryants office Youre back awfully soon his superior said leaning back in his chair and taking a pinch of Specific No 1 snuff I got what you sent me for Rick seated himself facing the desk He set his briefcase down Im tired he realized It had begun to hit him now that he had gotten back he wondered if he would be able to recoup enough for the job ahead Hows Dave he asked Well enough for me to go talk to him I want to before I tackle the first of the andys Bryant said Youll be trying for Polokov first The one that lasered Dave Best to get him right out of it since he knows weve got him listed Before I talk to Dave Bryant reached for a sheet of onionskin paper a blurred third or fourth carbon Polokov has taken a job with the city as a trash collector a scavenger Dont only specials do that kind of work Polokov is mimicking a special an anthead Very deterioratedor so he pretends to be Thats what suckered Dave Polokov apparently looks and acts so much like an anthead that Dave forgot Are you sure about the VoigtKampff scale now Youre absolutely certain from what happened up in Seattle that I am Rick said shortly He did not amplify Bryant said Ill take your word for it But there cant be even one slipup There never could be in andy hunting This is no different The Nexus6 is different I already found my first one Rick said And Dave found two Three if you count Polokov Okay Ill retire Polokov today and then maybe tonight or tomorrow talk to Dave He reached for the blurred carbon the poop sheet on the android Polokov One more item Bryant said A Soviet cop from the WPO is on his way here While you were in Seattle I got a call from him hes aboard an Aeroflot rocket thatll touch down at the public field here in about an hour Sandor Kadalyi his name is Whats he want Rarely if ever did WPO cops show up in San Francisco WPO is enough interested in the new Nexus6 types that they want a man of theirs to be with you An observer and also if he can hell assist you Its for you to decide when and if he can be of value But Ive already given him permission to tag along What about the bounty Rick said You wont have to split it Bryant said and smiled creakily I just wouldnt regard it as financially fair He had absolutely no intention of sharing his winnings with a thug from WPO He studied the poop sheet on Polokov it gave a description of the manor rather the andyand his current address and place of business The Bay Area Scavengers Company with offices on Geary Want to wait on the Polokov retirement until the Soviet cop gets here to help you Bryant asked Rick bristled Ive always worked alone Of course its your decisionIll do whatever you say But Id just as soon tackle Polokov right now without waiting for Kadalyi to hit town You go ahead on your own Bryant decided And then on the next one whichll be a Miss Luba Luftyou have the sheet there on her tooyou can bring in Kadalyi Having stuffed the onionskin carbons in his briefcase Rick left his superiors office and ascended once more to the roof and his parked hovercar And now lets visit Mr Polokov he said to himself He patted his laser tube For his first try at the android Polokov Rick stopped off at the offices of the Bay Area Scavengers Company Im looking for an employee of yours he said to the severe grayhaired switchboard woman The scavengers building impressed him large and modern it held a good number of highcllass purely office employees The deeppile carpets the expensive genuine wood desks reminded him that garbage collecting and trash disposal had since the war become one of Earths important industries The entire planet had begun to disintegrate into junk and to keep the planet habitable for the remaining population the junk had to be hauled away occasionally  or as Buster Friendly liked to declare Earth would die under a layernot of radioactive dustbut of kipple Mr Ackers the switchboard woman informed him Hes the personnel manager She pointed to an impressive but imitation oak desk at which sat a prissy tiny bespectacled individual merged with his plethora of paperwork Rick presented his police ID Wheres your employee Polokov right now At his job or at home After reluctantly consulting his records Mr Ackers said Polokov ought to be at work Flattening hovercars at our Daly City plant and dumping them into the Bay However The personnel manager consulted a further document then picked up his vidphone and made an inside call to someone else in the building Hes not then he said terminating the call hanging up he said to Rick Polokov didnt show up for work today No explanation Whats he done officer  If he should show up Rick said dont tell him I here asking about him You understand Yes I understand Ackers said sulkily as if his deep schooling in police matters had been derided In the departments beefedup hovercar Rick next flew to Polokovs apartment building in the Tenderloin Well never get him he told himself TheyBryant and Holdenwaited too long Instead of sending me to Seattle Bryant should have sicced me on Polokovbetter still last night as soon as Dave Holden got his What a grimy place he observed as he walked across the roof to the elevator Abandoned animal pens encrusted with months of dust And in one cage a no longer functioning false animal a chicken By elevator he descended to Polokovs floor found the hall limit like a subterranean cave Using his police Apowered sealedbeam light he illuminated the hall and once again glanced over the onionskin carbon The VoigtKampff test had been administered to Polokov that part could be bypassed and he could go directly to the task of destroying the android Best to get him from out here he decided Setting down his weapons kit he fumbled it open got out a nondirectional Penfield wave transmitter he punched the key for catalepsy himself protected against the mood emanation by means of a counterwave broadcast through the transmitters metal hull directed to him alone Theyre now all frozen stiff he said to himself as he shut off the transmitter Everyone human and andy alike in the vicinity No risk to me all I have to do is walk in and laser him Assuming of course that hes in his apartment which isnt likely Using an infinity key which anayzed and opened all forms of locks known he entered Polokovs apartment laser beam in hand No Polokov Only semiruined furniture a place of kipple and decay In fact no personal articles what greeted him consisted of unclaimed debris which Polokov had inherited when he took the apartment and which in leaving he had abandoned to the nextif anytenant I knew it he said to himself Well there goes the first thousand dollars bounty probably skipped all the way to the Antarctic Circle Out of my jurisdiction another bounty hunter from another police department will retire Polokov and claim the money On I suppose to the andys who havent been warned as was Polokov On to Luba Luft Back again on the roof in his hovercar he reported by phone to Harry Bryant No luck on Polokov Left probably right after he lasered Dave He inspected his wristwatch Want me to pick up Kadalyi at the field Itll save time and Im eager to get started on Miss Luft He already had the poop sheet on her laid out before him had begun a thorough study of it Good idea Bryant said except that Mr Kadalyi is already here his Aeroflot shipas usual he saysarrived early Just a moment An invisible conference Hell fly over and meet you where you are now Bryant said returning to the screen Meanwhile read up on Miss Luft An opera singer Allegedly from Germany At present attached to the San Francisco Opera Company He nodded in reflexive agreement mind on the poop sheet Must have a good voice to make connections so fast Okay Ill wait here for Kadalyi He gave Bryant his location and rang off Ill pose as an opera fan Rick decided as he read further I particularly would like to see her as Donna Anna in Don Giovanni  In my personal collection I have tapes by such oldtime greats as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Lotte Lehmann and Lisa Della Casa thatll give us something to discuss while I set up my VoigtKampff equipment His car phone buzzed He picked up the receiver The police operator said Mr Deckard a call for Von from Seattle Mr Bryant said to put it through to you From the Rosen Association Okay Rick said and waited What do they want he wondered As far as he could discern the Rosens had already proven to be bad news And undoubtedly would continue so whatever they intended Rachel Rosens face appeared on the tiny screen Hello Officer Deckard Her tone seemed placating that caught his attention Are you busy right now or can I talk to you Go ahead he said We of the association have been discussing your situation regarding the escaped Nexus6 types and knowing them as we do we feel that youll have better luck if one of us works in conjunction with you By doing what Well by one of us coming along with you When you go out looking for them Why What would you add Rachael said The Nexus6s would be wiry at being approached by a human But if another Nexus6 made the contact You specifically mean yourself Yes She nodded her face sober Ive got too much help already But I really think you need me I doubt it Ill think it over and call you back At some distant unspecified future time he said to himself Or more likely never Thats all I need Rachael Rosen popping up through the dust at every step You dont really mean it Rachael said Youll never call me You dont realize how agile an illegal escaped Nexus6 is how impossible itll be for you We feel we owe you this because ofyou know What we did Ill take it under advisement He started to hang up Without me Rachael said one of them will get you before you can get it Goodby he said and hung up What kind of world is it he asked himself when an android phones up a bounty hunter and offers him assistance He rang the police operator back Dont put any more calls through to me from Seattle he said Yes Mr Deckard Has Mr Kadalyi reached you yet Im still waiting And he had better hurry because Im not going to be here long Again he hung up As he resumed reading the poop sheet on Luba Luft a hovercar taxi spun down to land on the roof a few yards off From it a redfaced cherubiclooking man evidently in his midfifties wearing a heavy and impressive Russianstyle greatcoat stepped and smiling his hand extended approached Ricks car Mr Deckard the man asked with a Slavic accent The bounty hunter for the San Francisco Police Department The empty taxi rose and the Russian watched it go absently Im Sandor Kadalyi the man said and opened the car door to squeeze in beside Rick As he shook hands with Kadalyi Rick noticed that the WPO representative carried an unusual type of laser tube a subform which he had never seen before Oh this Kadalyi said Interesting isnt it He tugged it from his belt holster I got this on Mars I thought I knew every handgun made Rick said Even those manufactured at and for use in the colonies We made this ourselves Kadalyi said beaming like a Slavic Santa his ruddy face inscribed with pride You like it What is different about it functionally ishere take it He passed the gun over to Rick who inspected it expertly by way of years of experience How does it differ functionally Rick asked He couldnt tell Press the trigger Aiming upward out the window of the car Rick squeezed the trigger of the weapon Nothing happened no beam emerged Puzzled he turned to Kadalyi The triggering circuit Kadalyi said cheerfully isnt attached It remains with me You see He opened his hand revealed a tiny unit And I can also direct it within certain limits Irrespective of where its aimed Youre not Polokov youre Kadalyi Rick said Dont you mean that the other way around Youre a bit confused I mean youre Polokov the android youre not from the Soviet police Rick with his toe pressed the emergency button on the floor of his car Why wont my laser tube fire KadalyiPolokov said switching on and off the miniaturized triggering and aiming device which he held in the palm of his hand A sine wave Rick said That phases out laser emanation and spreads the beam into ordinary light Then Ill have to break your pencil neck The android dropped the device and with a snarl grabbed with both hands for Ricks throat As the androids hands sank into his throat Rick fired his regulation issue oldstyle pistol from its shoulder holster the 38 magnum slug struck the android in the head and its brain box burst The Nexus6 unit which operated it blew into pieces a raging mad wind which carried throughout the car Bits of it like the radioactive dust itself whirled down on Rick The retired remains of the android rocked back collided with the car door bounced off and struck heavily against him he found himself struggling to shove the twitching remnants of the android away Shakily he at last reached for the car phone called in to the Hall of Justice Shall I make my report he said Tell Harry Bryant that I got Polokov You got Polokov Hell understand that will he Yes Rick said and hung up Christ that came close he said to himself I must have overreacted to Rachael Rosens warning I went the other way and it almost finished me But I got Polokov he said to himself His adrenal gland by degrees ceased pumping its several secretions into his bloodstream his heart slowed to normal his breathing became less frantic But he still shook Anyhow I made myself a thousand dollars just now he informed himself So it was worth it And Im faster to react than Dave Holden Of course however Daves experience evidently prepared me that has to be admitted Dave had not had such warning Again picking up the phone he placed a call home to his apt to Iran Meanwhile he managed to light a cigarette the shaking had begun to depart His wifes face sodden with the sixhour selfaccusatory depression which she had prophesied manifested itself on the vidscreen Oh hello Rick What happened to the 594 I dialed for you before I left Pleased acknowledgment of I redialed As soon as you left What do you want Her voice sank into a dreary drone of despond Im so tired and I just have no hope left of anything Of our marriageand you possibly getting killed by one of those andys Is that what you want to tell me Rick That an andy got you In the background the racket of Buster Friendly boomed and brayed eradicating her words he saw her mouth moving but heard only the TV Listen he broke in Can you hear me Im on to something A new type of android that apparently nobody can handle but me Ive retired one already so thats a grand to start with You know what were going to have before Im through Iran stared at him sightlessly Oh she said nodding I havent said yet He could tell now her depression this time had become too vast for her even to hear him For all intents he spoke into a vacuum Ill see you tonight he finished bitterly and slammed the receiver down Damn her he said to himself What good does it do my risking my life She doesnt care whether we own an ostrich or not nothing penetrates I wish I had gotten rid of her two years ago when we were considering splitting up I can still do it he reminded himself Broodingly he leaned down gathered together on the car floor his crumpled papers including the info on Luba Luft No support he informed himself Most androids Ive known have more vitality and desire to live than my wife She has nothing to give me That made him think of Rachael Rosen again Her advice to me as to the Nexus6 mentality he realized turned out to be correct Assuming she doesnt want any of the bounty money maybe I could use her The encounter with KadalyiPolokov had changed his ideas rather massively Snapping on his hovercars engine he whisked nippitynip up into the sky heading toward the old War Memorial Opera House where according to Dive Holdens notes he would find Luba Luft this time of the day He wondered now about her too Some female androids seemed to him pretty he had found himself physically attracted by several and it was an odd sensation knowing intellectually that they were machines but emotionally reacting anyhow For example Rachael Rosen No he decided shes too thin No real development especially in the bust A figure like a childs flat and tame He could do better How old did the poop sheet say Luba Luft was As he drove he hauled out the now wrinkled notes found her socalled age Twentyeight the sheet read Judged by appearance which with andys was the only useful standard Its a good thing I know something about opera Rick reflected Thats another advantage I have over Dave Im more culturally oriented Ill try one more andy before I ask Rachael for help he decided If Miss Luft proves exceptionally hardbut he had an intuition she wouldnt Polokov had been the rough one the others unaware that anyone actively hunted them would crumble in succession plugged like a file of ducks As he descended toward the ornate expansive roof of the opera house he loudly sang a potpourri of arias with pseudoItalian words made up on the spot by himself even without the Penfield mood organ at hand his spirits brightened into optimism And into hungry gleeful anticipation CHAPTER 9 In the enormous whalebelly of steel and stone carved out to form the longenduring old opera house Rick Deckard found an echoing noisy slightly miscontrived rehearsal taking place As he entered he recognized the music Mozarts The Magic Flute the first act in its final scenes The moors slavesin other words the chorushad taken up their song a bar too soon and this had nullified the simple rhythm of the magic bells What a pleasure he loved The Magic Flute He seated himself in a dress circle scat no one appeared to notice him and made himself comfortable Now Popageno in his fantastic pelt of bird feathers had joined Pamina to sing words which always brought tears to Ricks eyes when and if he happened to think about it Könnte jedar brave Mann solche Glöckchen finden eine Feinde würden dann ohne Muhe schwinden Well Rick thought in real life no such magic bells exist that make your enemy effortlessly disappear Too bad And Mozart not long after writing The Magic Flute had died in his thirtiesof kidney disease And had been buried in an unmarked paupers grave Thinking this he wondered if Mozart had had any intuition that the future did not exist that he had already used up his little time Maybe I have too Rick thought as he watched the rehearsal move along This rehearsal will end the performance will end the singers will die eventually the last score of the music will be destroyed in one way or another finally the name Mozart will vanish the dust will have won If not on this planet then another We can evade it awhile As the andys can evade me and exist a finite stretch longer But I get them or some other bounty hunter gets them In a way he realized Im part of the formdestroying process of entropy The Rosen Association creates and I unmake Or anyhow so it must seem to them On the stage Papageno and Pamina engaged in a dialogue He stopped his introspection to listen Papageno  My child what should we now say Pamina  the truth Thats what we will say Leaning forward and peering Rick studied Pamina in her heavy convoluted robes with her wimple trailing its veil about her shoulders and face He reexamined the poop sheet then leaned back satisfied Ive now seen my third Nexus6 android he realized This is Luba Luft A little ironic tile sentiment her role calls for However vital active and nicelooking an escaped android could hardly tell the truth about itself anyhow On tile stage Luba Luft sang and he found himself surprised at the quality of her voice it rated with that of the best even that of notables in his collection of historic tapes The Rosen Associaion built her well he had to admit And again he perceived himself sub specie aeternitatis the formdestroyer called forth by what he heard and saw here Perhaps the better she functions the better a singer she is the more I am needed If the androids had remained substandard like the ancient q40s made by Derain Associatesthere would be no problem and no need of my skill I wonder when I should do it he asked himself As soon as possible probably At the end of the rehearsal when she goes to her dressing room At the end of the act the rehearsal ended temporarily It would resume the conductor said in English French and German in an hour and a half The conductor then departed the musicians left their instruments and also left Getting to his feet Rick made his way backstage to the dressing rooms he followed the tail end of the cast taking his time and thinking Its better this way getting it immediately over with Ill spend as short a time talking to her and testing her as possible As soon as Im surebut technically he could not be sure until after the test Maybe Dave guessed wrong on her he conjectured I hope so But he doubted it Already instinctively his professional sense had responded And he had yet to err  throughout years with the department Stopping a super he asked for Miss Lufts dressing room the super wearing makeup and the costume of an Egyptian spear carrier pointed Rick arrived at the indicated door saw an inkwritten note tacked to it reading MISS LUFT PRIVATE and knocked Come in He entered The girl sat at her dressing table a muchhandled clothbound score open on her knees marking here and there with a ballpoint pen She still wore her costume and makeup except for the wimple that she had set down on its rack Yes she said looking up The stage makeup enlarged her eyes enormous and hazel they fixed on him and did not waver I am busy as you can see Her English contained no remnant of an accent Rick said You compare favorably to Schwarzkopf Who are you Her tone held cold reserveand that other cold which he had encountered in so many androids Always the same great intellect ability to accomplish much but also this He deplored it And yet without it he could not track them down Im from the San Francisco Police Department he said Oh The huge and intense eyes did not flicker did not respond What are you here about Her tone oddly seemed gracious Seating himself in a nearby chair he unzipped his briefcase I have been sent here to administer a standard personalityprofile test to you It wont take more than a few minutes Is it necessary She gestured toward the big clothbound score I have a good deal I must do Now she had begun to look apprehensive Itsnecessary He got out the VoigtKampff instruments began setting them up AnIQ test No Empathy Ill have to put on my glasses She reached to open a drawer of her dressing table If you can mark the score without your glasses you can take this test Ill show you some pictures and ask you several questions Meanwhile He got up and walked to her and bending pressed the adhesive pad of sensitive grids against her deeply tinted check And this light he said adjusting the angle of the pencil beam and thats it Do you think Im an android Is that it Her voice had faded almost to extinction Im not an android I havent even been on Mars Ive never even seen an android Her elongated lashes shuddered involuntarily he saw her trying to appear calm Do you have information that theres an android in the cast Id be glad to help you and if I were an android would I be glad to help you An android he said doesnt care what happens to any other android Thats one of the indications we look for Then Miss Luft said you must be an android That stopped him he stared at her Because she continued Your job is to kill them isnt it Youre what they call She tried to remember A bounty hunter Rick said But Im not an android This test you want to give me Her voice now had begun to return Have you taken it Yes He nodded A long long time ago when I first started with the department Maybe thats a false memory Dont androids sometimes go around with false memories Rick said My superiors know about the test Its mandatory Maybe there was once a human who looked like you and somewhere along the line you killed him and took his place And your superiors dont know She smiled As if inviting him to agree Lets get on with the test he said getting out the sheets of questions Ill take the test Luba Luft said if youll take it first Again he stared at her stopped in his tracks Wouldnt that be more fair she asked Then I could be sure of you I dont know you seem so peculiar and hard and strange She shivered then smiled again Hopefully You wouldnt be able to administer the VoigtKampff test It takes considerable experience Now please listen carefully These questions will deal with social situations which you might find yourself in what I want from you is a statement of response what youd do And I want the response as quickly as you can give it One of the factors Ill record is the time lag if any He selected his initial question Youre sitting watching TV and suddenly you discover a wasp crawling on your wrist He checked with his watch counting the seconds And checked too with the twin dials Whats a wasp Luba Luft asked A stinging bug that flies Oh how strange Her immense eyes widened with childlike acceptance as if he had revealed the cardinal mystery of creation Do they still exist Ive never seen one They died out because of the dust Dont you really know what a wasp is You must have been alive when there were wasps thats only been Tell me the German word He tried to think of the German word for wasp but couldnt Your English is perfect he said angrily My accent she corrected is perfect It has to be for roles for Purcell and Walton and Vaughn Williams But my vocabulary isnt very large She glanced at him shyly Wespe  he said remembering the German word Ach yes eine Wespe  She laughed And what was the question I forget already Lets try another Impossible now to get a meaningful response You are watching an old movie on TV a movie from before the war It shows a banquet in progress the entréehe skipped over the first part of the questionconsists of boiled dog stuffed with rice Nobody would kill and cat a dog Luba Luft said Theyre worth a fortune But I guess it would be an imitation dog ersatz Right But those are made of wires and motors they cant be eaten Before the war he grated I wasnt alive before the war But youve seen old movies on TV Was the movie made in the Philippines Why Because Luba Luft said they used to cat boiled dog stuffed with rice in the Philippines I remember reading that But your response he said I want your social emotional moral reaction To the movie She pondered Id turn it off and watch Buster Friendly Why would you turn it off Well she said hotly who the hell wants to watch an old movie set in the Philippines What ever happened in the Philippines except the Bataan Death March and would you want to watch that She glared at him indignantly On his dials the needles swung in all directions After a pause he said carefully You rent a mountain cabin Ja  She nodded Go on Im waiting In an area still verdant Pardon She cupped her ear I dont ever hear that term Still trees and bushes growing The cabin is rustic knotty pine with a huge fireplace On the walls someone has hung old snaps Currier and Ives prints and above the fireplace a deers head has been mounted a full stag with developed horns The people with you admire the decor of the cabin and I dont understand Currier or Ives or decor Luba Luft said she seemed to be struggling however to make out the terms Wait She held up her hand earnestly With rice like in the dog Currier is what makes the rice currier rice Its Curry in German He could not fathom for the life of him if Luba Lufts semantic fog had purpose After consultation with himself he decided to try another question what else could he do Youre dating a man he said and he asks you to visit his apartment While youre there O nein  Luba broke in I wouldnt be there Thats easy to answer Thats not the question Did you get the wrong question But I understand that why is a question I understand the wrong one Arent I supposed to understand Nervously fluttering she rubbed her cheek and detached the adhesive disk It dropped to the floor skidded and rolled under her dressing table Ach Gott  she muttered bending to retrieve it A ripping sound that of cloth tearing Her elaborate costume Ill get it he said and lifted her aside he knelt down groped under the dressing table until his fingers located the disk When he stood up he found himself looking into a laser tube Your questions Luba Luft said in a crisp formal voice began to do with sex I thought they would finally Youre not from the police department youre a sexual deviant You can look at my identification He reached toward his coat pocket His hand he saw had again begun to shake as it had with Polokov If you reach in there Luba Luft said Ill kill you You will anyhow He wondered how it would have worked out if he had waited until Rachael Rosen could join him Well no use dwelling on that Let me see some more of your questions She held out her hand and reluctantly he passed her the sheets In a magazine you come across a fullpage color picture of a nude girl Well thats one You became pregnant by a man who has promised to marry you The man goes off with another woman your best friend you get an abortion The pattern of your questioning is obvious Im going to call the police Still holding the laser tube in his direction she crossed the room picked tip the vidphone dialed the operator Connect me with the San Francisco Police Department she said I need a policeman What youre doing Rick said with relief is the best idea possible Yet it seemed strange to him that Luba had decided to do this why didnt she simply kill him Once the patrolman arrived her chance would disappear and it all would go his way She must think shes human he decided Obviously she doesnt know A few minutes later during which Luba carefully kept the laser tube on him a large harness bull arrived in his archaic blue uniform with gun and star All right he said at once to Luba Put that thing away She set down the laser tube and he picked it up to examine it to see if it carried a charge Now whats been going on here he asked her Before she could answer he turned to Rick Who are you he demanded Luba Luft said He came into my dressing room Ive never seen him before in my life He pretended to be taking a poll or something and he wanted to ask me questions I thought it was all right and I said okay and then he began asking me obscene questions Lets see your identification the harness bull said to Rick his hand extended As he got out his ID Rick said Im a bounty hunter with the department I know all the bounty hunters the harness bull said to Rick as he examined Ricks wallet With the S F Police Department  My supervisor is Inspector Harry Bryant Rick said Ive taken over Dave Holdens list now that Daves in the hospital As I say I know all the bounty hunters the harness bull said and Ive never heard of you He handed Ricks ID back to him Call Inspector Bryant Rick said There isnt any Inspector Bryant the harness bull said It came to Rick what was going on Youre an android he said to the harness bull Like Miss Luft Going to the vidphone he picked up the receiver himself Im going to call the department He wondered how far be would get before the two androids stopped him The number the harness bull said is I know the number Rick dialed presently had the police switchboard operator Let me talk to Inspector Bryant he said Who is calling please This is Rick Deckard He stood waiting meanwhile off to one side the harness bull was getting a statement from Luba Luft neither paid any attention to him A pause and then Harry Bryants face appeared on the vidscreen Whats doing he asked Rick Some trouble Rick said One of those on Daves list managed to call in and get a socalled patrolman out here I cant seem to prove to him who I am he says he knows all the about hunters in the department and hes never heard of me He added He hasnt heard of you either Bryant said Let me talk to him Inspector Bryant wants to talk to you Rick held out the vidphone receiver The harness bull ceased questioning Miss Luft and came over to take it Officer Crams the harness bull said briskly A pause Hello He listened said hello several times more waited then turned to Rick Theres nobody on the line And nobody on the screen He pointed to the vidphone screen and Rick saw nothing on it Taking the receiver from the harness bull Rick said Mr Bryant He listened waited nothing Ill dial again He hung up waited then redialed the familiar number The phone rang but no one answered it the phone rang on and on Let me try Officer Crams said taking the receiver away from Rick You must have misdialed He dialed The number is 842 I know the number Rick said Officer Crams calling in the harness bull said into the Phone receiver Is there an Inspector Bryant connected with the department A short pause Well what about a bounty hunter named Rick Deckard Again a pause Youre sure Could he have recentlyoh I see okay thanks No I have it under control Officer Crams rang off turned toward Rick I had him on the line Rick said I talked to him he said hed talk to you It must be phone trouble the connection must have been broken somewhere along the way Didnt you seeBryants face showed on the screen and then it didnt He felt bewildered Officer Crams said I have Miss Lufts statement Deckard So lets go down to the Hall of Justice so I can book you Okay Rick said To Luba Luft he said Ill be back in a short while Im still not finished testing you Hes a deviant Luba Luft said to Officer Crams He gives me the creeps She shivered What opera are you practicing to give Officer Crams asked her The Magic Flute Rick said I didnt ask you I asked her The harness buff gave him a glance of dislike Im anxious to get to the Hall of Justice Rick said This matter should be straightened out He started toward the door of the dressing room his briefcase gripped Ill search you first Officer Crams deftly frisked him and came up with Ricks service pistol and laser tube He appropriated both after a moment of sniffing the muzzle of the pistol This has been fired recently he said I retired an andy just now Rick said The remains are still in my car up on the roof Okay Officer Crams said Well go up and have a look As the two of them started from the dressing room Miss Luft followed as far as the door He wont come back again will he Officer Im really afraid of him hes so strange If hes got the body of someone he killed upstairs in his car Crams said he wont be coming back He nudged Rick forward and together the two of them ascended by elevator to the roof of the opera house Opening the door of Ricks car Officer Crams silently inspected the body of Polokov An android Rick said I was sent after him He almost got me by pretending to be Theyll take your statement at the Hall of Justice Officer Crams interrupted He nudged Rick over to his parked plainly marked police car there by police radio he put in a call for someone to come pick up Polokov Okay Deckard he said then ringing off Lets get started With the two of them aboard the patrol car zummed up from the roof and headed south Something Rick noticed was not as it should be Officer Crams had steered the car in the wrong direction The Hall of justice Rick said is north on Lombard Thats the old Hall of Justice Officer Crams said The new one is on Mission That old building its disintegrating its a ruin Nobodys used that for years Has it been that long since you last got booked Take me there Rick said To Lombard Street He understood it all now saw what the androids working together had achieved He would not live beyond this ride for him it was the end as it had almost been for Daveand probably eventually would be That girls quite a looker Officer Crams said Of course with that costume you cant tell about her figure But Id say its damn okay Rick said Admit to me that youre an android Why Im not an android What do you do roam around killing people and telling yourself theyre androids I can see why Miss Luft was scared Its a good thing for her that she called us Then take me to the Hall of Justice on Lombard Like I said Itll take about three minutes Rick said I want to see it Every morning I check in for work there I want to see that its been abandoned for years as you say Maybe youre an android Officer Crams said With a false memory like they give them Had you thought of that He grinned frigidly as he continued to drive south Conscious of his defeat and failure Rick settled back And helplessly waited for what came next Whatever the androids had planned now that they had physical possession of him But I did get one of them he told himself I got Polokov And Dave got two Hovering over Mission Officer Cramss police car prepared to descend for its landing CHAPTER 10 The Mission Street Hall of Justice building onto the roof of which the hovercar descended jutted up in a series of baroque ornamented spires complicated and modem the handsome structure struck Rick Deckard as attractiveexcept for one aspect He had never seen it before The police hovercar landed And a few minutes later he found himself being booked 304 Officer Crams said to the sergeant at the high desk And 6124 and lets see Representing himself to be a peace officer 4067 the desk sergeant said filling out the forms he wrote leisurely in a slightly bored manner Routine business his posture and expression declared Nothing of importance Over here Officer Crams said to Rick leading him to a small white table at which a technician operated familiar equipment For your cephalic pattern Crams said Identpurposes Rick said brusquely I know In the old days when he had been a harness bull himself he had brought many suspects to a table like this Like this but not this particular table His cephatic pattern taken he found himself being led off to an equally familiar room reflexively he began assembling his valuables for transfer It makes no sense he said to himself Who are these people If this place has always existed why didnt we know about it And why dont they know about us Two parallel police agencies he said to himself ours and this one But never coming in contactas far as I know until now Or maybe they have he thought Maybe this isnt the first time Hard to believe he thought that this wouldnt have happened long ago If this really is a police apparatus here if its what it asserts itself to be A man not in uniform detached himself from the spot at which he had been standing he approached Rick Deckard at a measured unruffled pace gazing at him curiously Whats this one he asked Officer Crams Suspected homicide Crams answered We have a bodywe found it in his carbut he claims its an android Were checking it out giving it a bone marrow analysis at the lab And posing as a police officer a bounty hunter To gain access to a womans dressing room in order to ask her suggestive questions She doubted he was what he said he was and called us in Stepping back Crams said Do you want to finish up with him sir  All right The senior police official not in uniform blueeyed with a narrow flaring nose and inexpressive lips eyed Rick then reached for Ricks briefcase What do you have in here Mr Deckard  Rick said Material pertaining to the VoigtKampfF personality test I was testing a suspect when Officer Crams arrested me He watched as the police official rummaged through the contents of the briefcase examining each item The questions I asked Miss Luft are standard VK questions printed on the Do you know George Gleason and Phil Resch the police official asked No Rick said neither name meant anything to him Theyre the bounty hunters for Northern California Both are attached to our department Maybe youll run into them while youre here Are you an android Mr Deckard The reason I ask is that several times in the past weve had escaped andys turn up posing as outofstate bounty hunters here in pursuit of a suspect Rick said Im not an android You can administer the VoigtKampff test to me Ive taken it before and I dont mind taking it again But I know what the results will be Can I phone my wife Youre allowed one call Would you rather phone her than a lawyer Ill phone my wife Rick said She can get a lawyer for me The plainclothes police officer handed him a fiftycent piece and pointed Theres the vidphone over there He watched as Rick crossed the room to the phone Then he returned to his examination of the contents of Ricks briefcase Inserting the coin Rick dialed his home phone number And stood for what seemed like an eternity waiting A womans face appeared on the vidscreen Hello she said It was not Iran He had never seen the woman before in his life He hung up walked slowly back to the police officer No luck the officer asked Well you can make another call we have a liberal policy in that regard I cant offer you the opportunity of calling a bondsman because your offense is unbailable at present When youre arraigned however I know Rick said acridly Im familiar with police procedure Heres your briefcase the officer said he handed it back to Rick Come into my office Id like to talk with you further He started down a side hall leading the way Rick followed Then pausing and turning the officer said My name is Garland He held out his hand and they shook Briefly Sit down Garland said as he opened his office door and pushed behind a large uncluttered desk Rick seated himself facing the desk This VoigtKampff test Garland said that you mentioned He indicated Ricks briefcase All that material you carry he filled and lit a pipe puffed for a moment Its an analytical tool for detecting andys Its our basic test Rick said The only one we currently employ The only one capable of distinguishing the new Nexus6 brain unit You havent heard of this test Ive heard of several profileanalysis scales for use with androids But not that one He continued to study Rick intently his face turgid Rick could not fathom what Garland was thinking Those smudged carbon flimsies Garland continued that you have there in your briefcase Polokov Miss Luft  your assignments The next one is me Rick stared at him then grabbed for the briefcase In a moment the carbons lay spread out before him Garland had told the truth Rick examined the sheet Neither manor rather neither he nor Garlandspoke for a time and then Garland cleared his throat coughed nervously Its an unpleasant sensation he said To find yourself a bounty hunters assignment all of a sudden Or whatever it is you are Deckard He pressed a key on his desk intercom and said Send one of the bounty hunters in here I dont care which one Okay thank you He released the key Phil Resch will be in here a minute or so from now he said to Rick I want to see his list before I proceed You think I might be on his list Rick said Its possible Well know pretty soon Best to be sure about these critical matters Best not to leave it to chance This info sheet about me He indicated the smudged carbon It doesnt list me as a police inspector it inaccurately gives my occupation as insurance underwriter Otherwise its correct as to physical description age personal habits home address Yes its me all right Look for yourself He pushed the page to Rick who picked it up and glanced over it The office door opened and a tall fleshless man with hardetched features wearing hornrim glasses and a fuzzy Vandyke beard appeared Garland rose indicating Rick Phil Resch Rick Deckard Youre both bounty hunters and its probably time you met As he shook hands with Rick Phil Resch said Which city are you attached to Garland answered for Rick San Francisco Here take a look at his schedule This one comes up next He handed Phil Resch the sheet which Rick had been examining that with his own description Say Gar Phil Resch said This is you Theres more Garland said Hes also got Luba Luft the opera singer there on his list of retirementassignments and Polokov Remember Polokov Hes now dead this bounty hunter or android or whatever he is got him and we running a bone marrow test at the lab To see if theres any conceivable basis Polokov Ive talked to Phil Resch said That big Santa Claus from the Soviet police He pondered plucking at his disarrayed beard I think its a good idea to run a bone marrow test on him Why do you say that Garland asked clearly annoyed Its to remove any legal basis on which this man Deckard could claim he hadnt killed anyone he only retired an android Phil Resch said Polokov struck me as cold Extremely cerebral and calculating detached A lot of the Soviet police are that way Garland said visibly nettled Luba Luft I never met Phil Resch said Although Ive heard records shes made To Rick he said Did you test her out  I started to Rick said But I couldnt get an accurate reading And she called in a harness bull which ended it And Polokov Phil Resch asked I never got a chance to test him either Phil Resch said mostly to himself And I assume you havent had an opportunity to test out Inspector Garland here Of course not Garland interjected his face wrinkled with indignation his words broke off bitter and sharp What test do you use Phil Resch asked The VoigtKampff scale Dont know that particular one Both Resch and Garland seemed deep in rapid professional thoughtbut not in unison Ive always said he continued that the best place for an android would be with a big police organization such as WPO Ever since I first met Polokov Ive wanted to test him but no pretext ever arose It never would have either  which is one of the values such a spot would have for an enterprising android Getting slowly to his feet Inspector Garland faced Phil Resch and said Have you wanted to test me too A discreet smiled traveled across Phil Reschs face he started to answer then shrugged And remained silent He did not seem afraid of his superior despite Garlands palpable wrath I dont think you understand the situation Garland said This manor androidRick Deckard comes to us from a phantom hallucinatory nonexistent police agency allegedly operating out of the old departmental headquarters on Lombard Hes never heard of us and weve never heard of himyet ostensibly were both working the same side of the street He employs a test weve never heard of The list he carries around isnt of androids its a list of human beings Hes already killed onceat least once And if Miss Luft hadnt gotten to a phone he probably would have killed her and then eventually he would have come sniffing around after me Hmm Phil Resch said Hmm Garland mimicked wrathfully He looked now as if he bordered on apoplexy Is that all you have to say The intercom came on and a female voice said Inspector Garland the lab report on Mr Polokovs corpse is ready I think we should hear it Phil Resch said Garland glanced at him seething Then he bent pressed the key of the intercom Lets have it Miss French The bone marrow test Miss French said shows that Mr Polokov was a humanoid robot Do you want a detailed No thats enough Garland settled back in his seat grimly contemplating the far wall he said nothing to either Rick or Phil Resch Resch said What is the basis of your VoigtKampff test Mr Deckard Empathic response In a variety of social situations Mostly having to do with animals Ours is probably simpler Resch said The reflexarc response taking place in the upper ganglia of the spinal column requires several microseconds more in the humanoid robot than in a human nervous system Reaching across Inspector Garlands desk he plucked a pad of paper toward him with a ballpoint pen he drew a sketch We use an audio signal or a lightflash The subject presses a button and the elapsed time is measured We try it a number of times of course Elapsed time varies in both the andy and the human But by the time ten reactions have been measured we believe we have a reliable clue And as in your case with Polokov the bone marrow test backs us up An interval of silence passed and then Rick said You can test me out Im ready Of course Id like to test you too If youre willing Naturally Resch said He was however studying Inspector Garland Ive said for years Resch murmured that the Boneli ReflexArc Test should be applied routinely to police personnel the higher up the chain of command the better Havent I Inspector Thats right you have Garland said And Ive always opposed it On the grounds that it would lower department morale I think now Rick said youre going to have to sit still for it In view of your labs report on Polokov CHAPTER 11 Garland said I guess so He jabbed a finger at the bounty hunter Phil Resch But Im warning you youre not going to like the results of the tests Do you know what theyll be Resch asked with visible surprise he did not look pleased I know almost to a hair Inspector Garland said Okay Resch nodded Ill go upstairs and get the Boneli gear He strode to the door of the office opened it and disappeared out into the hall Ill be back in three or four minutes he said to Rick The door shut after him Reaching into the righthand top drawer of his desk Inspector Garland fumbled about then brought forth a laser tube he swiveled it until it pointed at Rick Thats not going to make any difference Rick said Resch will have a postmortem run on me the same as your lab ran on Polokov And hell still insist on awhat did you call itBoneli ReflexArc Test on you and on himself The laser tube remained in its position and then Inspector Garland said It was a bad day all day Especially when I saw Officer Crams bringing you in I had an intuitionthats why I intervened By degrees he lowered the laser beam he sat gripping it and then he shrugged and returned it to the desk drawer locking the drawer and restoring the key to his pocket What will tests on the three of us show Rick asked Garland said That damn fool Resch He actually doesnt know He doesnt know he doesnt suspect he doesnt have the slightest idea Otherwise he couldnt live out a life as a bounty hunter a human occupationhardly an android occupation Garland gestured toward Ricks briefcase Those other carbons the other suspects youre supposed to test and retire I know them all He paused then said We all came here together on the same ship from Mars Not Resch he stayed behind another week receiving the synthetic memory system He was silent then Or rather it was silent Rick said Whatll he do when he finds out I dont have the foggiest idea Garland said remotely It ought from an abstract intellectual viewpoint to be interesting He may kill me kill himself maybe you too He may kill everyone he can human and android alike I understand that such things happen when theres been a synthetic memory system laid down When one thinks its human So when you do that youre taking a chance Garland said Its a chance anyway breaking free and coming here to Earth where were not even considered animals Where every worm and wood louse is considered more desirable than all of us put together Irritably Garland picked at his lower lip Your position would be better r if Phil Resch could pass the Boneli test if it was just me The results that way would be predictable to Resch Id just be another andy to retire as soon as possible So youre not in a good position either Deckard Almost as bad in fact as I am You know where I guessed wrong I didnt know about Polokov He must have come here earlier obviously he came here earlier In another group entirelyno contact with ours He was already entrenched in the WPO when I arrived I took a chance on the lab report which I shouldnt have Crams of course took the same chance Polokov was almost my finish too Rick said Yes there was something about him I dont think he could have been the same brain unit type as we he must have been souped up or tinkered withan altered structure unfamiliar even to us A good one too Almost good enough When I phoned my apartment Rick said why didnt I get my wife All our vidphone lines here are trapped They recirculate the call to other offices within the building This is a homeostatic enterprise were operating here Deckard Were a closed loop cut off from the rest of San Francisco We know about them but they dont know about us Sometimes an isolated person such as yourself wanders in here or as in your case is brought herefor our protection He gestured convulsively toward the office door Here comes eagerbeaver Phil Resch back with his handy dandy portable little test Isnt he clever Hes going to destroy his own life and mine and possibly yours You androids Rick said dont exactly cover for each other in times of stress Garland snapped I think youre right it would seem we lack a specific talent you humans possess I believe its called empathy The office door opened Phil Resch stood outlined carrying a device which trailed wires Here we are he said closing the door after him he seated himself plugging the device into the electrical outlet Bringing out his right hand Garland pointed at Resch At once Reschand also Rick Deckardrolled from their chairs and onto the floor at the same time Resch  aimed a laser tube and as he fell fired at Garland The laser beam aimed with skill based on years of training bifurcated Inspector Garlands head He slumped forward and from his hand his miniaturized laser beam rolled across the surface of his desk The corpse teetered on its chair and then like a sack of eggs it slid to one side and crashed to the floor It forgot Resch said rising to his feet that this is my job I can almost foretell what an android is going to do I suppose you can too He put his laser beam away bent and with curiosity examined the body of his quondam superior What did it say to you while I was gone That heitwas an android And you Rick broke off the conduits of his brain humming calculating and selecting he altered what he had started to say would detect it he finished In a few more minutes Anything else This building is androidinfested Resch said introspectively Thats going to make it hard for you and me to get out of here Nominally I have the authority to leave any time I want of course And to take a prisoner with me He listened no sound came from beyond the office I guess they didnt hear anything Theres evidently no bug installed here monitoring everything as there should be Gingerly he nudged the body of the android with the toe of his shoe It certainly is remarkable the psionic ability you develop in this business I knew before I opened the office door that he would take a shot at me Frankly Im surprised he didnt kill you while I was upstairs He almost did Rick said He had a big utilitymodel laser beam on me part of the time He was considering it But it was you he was worried about not me The android flees Resch said humorlessly where the bounty bunter pursues You realize dont you that youre going to have to double back to the opera house and get Luba Luft before anyone here has a chance to warn her as to how this came out Warn it I should say Do you think of them as it  I did at one time Rick said When my conscience occasionally bothered me about the work I had to do I protected myself by thinking of them that way but now I no longer find it necessary All right Ill head directly back to the opera house Assuming you can get me out of here Suppose we sit Garland up at his desk Resch said he dragged the corpse of the android back up into its chair arranging its arms and legs so that its posture appeared reasonably naturalif no one looked closely If no one came into the office Pressing a key on the desk intercom Phil Resch said Inspector Garland has asked that no calls be put through to him for the next half hour Hes involved in work that cant be interrupted Yes Mr Resch Releasing the intercom key Phil Resch said to Rick Im going to handcuff you to me during the time were still here in the building Once were airborne Ill naturally let you go He produced a pair of cuffs slapped one onto Ricks wrist and the other around his own Come on lets get it over with He squared his shoulders took a deep breath and pushed open the office door Uniformed police stood or sat on every side conducting their routine business of the day none of them glanced up or paid any attention as Phil Resch led Rick across the lobby to the elevator What Im afraid of Resch said as they waited for the elevator is that the Garland one had a dead mans throttle warning component built into it But He shrugged I would have expected it to go off by now otherwise its not much good The elevator arrived several policelike nondescript men and women disemelevatored cracked off across the lobby on their several errands They paid no attention to Rick or Phil Resch Do you think your department will take me on Resch asked as the elevator doors shut closing the two of them inside he punched the roof button and the elevator silently rose After all as of now Im out of a job To say the least Guardedly Rick said Idont see why not Except that we already have two bounty hunters Ive got to tell him he said to himself Its unethical and cruel not to Mr Resch youre an android he thought to himself You got me out of this place and heres your reward youre everything we jointly abominate The essence of what were committed to destroy I cant get over it Phil Resch said It doesnt seem possible For three years Ive been working under the direction of androids Why didnt I suspectI mean enough to do something Maybe it isnt that long Maybe they only recently infiltrated this building Theyve been here all the time Garland has been my superior from the start throughout my three years According to it Rick said the bunch of them came to Earth together And that wasnt as long ago as three years its only been a matter of months Then at one time an authentic Garland existed Phil Resch said And somewhere along the way got replaced His sharklike lean face twisted and he struggled to understand OrIve been impregnated with a false memory system Maybe I only remember Garland over the whole time But His face suffused now with growing torment continued to twist and work spasmodically Only androids show up with false memory systems its been found ineffective in humans The elevator ceased rising its doors slid back and there spread out ahead of them deserted except for empty parked vehicles lay the police stations roof field Heres my car Phil Resch said unlocking the door of a nearby hovercar and waving Rick rapidly inside he himself got in behind the wheel and started up the motor In a moment they had lifted into the sky and turning north headed back in the direction of the War Memorial Opera House Preoccupied Phil Resch drove by reflex his progressively more gloomy train of thought continued to dominate his attention Listen Deckard he said suddenly After we retire Luba LuftI want you to His voice husky and tormented broke off You know Give me the Boneli test or that empathy scale you have To see about me We can worry about that later Rick said evasively You dont want me to take it do you Phil Resch glanced at him with acute comprehension I guess you know what the results will be Garland must have told you something Facts which I dont know Rick said Its going to be hard even for the two of us to take out Luba Luft shes more than I could handle anyhow Lets keep our attention focused on that Its not just false memory structures Phil Resch said I own an animal not a false one but the real thing A squirrel I love the squirrel Deckard every goddamn morning I feed it and change its papersyou know clean up its cageand then in the evening when I get off work I let it loose in my apt and it runs all over the place It has a wheel in its cage ever seen a squirrel running inside a wheel It runs and runs the wheel spins but the squirrel stays in the same spot Buffy seems to like it though I guess squirrels arent too bright Rick said They flew on then in silence CHAPTER 12 At the opera house Rick Deckard and Phil Resch were informed that the rehearsal had ended And Miss Luft had left Did she say where she intended to go Phil Resch asked the stagehand showing his police identification Over to the museum The stagehand studied the ID card She said she wanted to take in the exhibit of Edvard Munch thats there now It ends tomorrow And Luba Luft Rick thought to himself ends today As the two of them walked down the sidewalk to the museum Phil Resch said What odds will you give Shes flown we wont find her at the museum Maybe Rick said They arrived at the museum building noted on which floor the Munch exhibit could be found and ascended Shortly they wandered amid paintings and woodcuts Many people had turned out for the exhibit including a grammar school class the shrill voice of the teacher penetrated all the rooms comprising the exhibit and Rick thought Thats what youd expect an andy to soundand looklike Instead of like Rachael Rosen and Luba Luft Andthe man beside him Or rather the thing beside him Did you ever hear of an andy having a pet of any sort Phil Resch asked him For sonic obscure reason he felt the need to be brutally honest perhaps he had already begun preparing himself for what lay ahead In two cases that I know of andys owned and cared for animals But its rare From what Ive been able to learn it generally fails the andy is unable to keep the animal alive Animals require an environment of warmth to flourish Except for reptiles and insects Would a squirrel need that An atmosphere of love Because Buffy is doing fine as sleek as an otter I groom and comb him every other day At an oil painting Phil Resch halted gazed intently The painting showed a hairless oppressed creature with a head like an inverted pear its hands clapped in horror to its ears its mouth open in a vast soundless scream Twisted ripples of the creatures torment echoes of its cry flooded out into the air surrounding it the man or woman whichever it was had become contained by its own howl It had covered its ears against its own sound The creature stood on a bridge and no one else was present the creature screamed in isolation Cut off byor despiteits outcry He did a woodcut of this Rick said reading the card tacked below the painting I think Phil Resch said that this is how an andy must feet He traced in the air the convolutions visible in the picture of the creatures cry I dont feel like that so maybe Im not an He broke off as several persons strolled up to inspect the picture Theres Luba Luft  Rick pointed and Phil Resch halted his somber introspection and defense the two of them walked at a measured pace toward her taking their time as if nothing confronted them as always it was vital to preserve the atmosphere of the commonplace Other humans having no knowledge of the presence of androids among them had to be protected at all costseven that of losing the quarry Holding a printed catalogue Luba Luft wearing shiny tapered pants and an illuminated gold vestlike top stood absorbed in the picture before her a drawing of a young girl hands clasped together seated on the edge of a bed an expression of bewildered wonder and new groping awe imprinted on the face Want me to buy it for you Rick said to Luba Luft he stood beside her holding laxly onto her upper arm informing her by his loose grip that he knew he had possession of herhe did not have to strain in an effort to detain her On the other side of her Phil Resch put his hand on her shoulder and Rick saw the bulge of the laser tube Phil Resch did not intend to take chances not after the near miss with Inspector Garland Its not for sale Luba Luft glanced at him idly then violently as she recognized him her eyes faded and the color dimmed from her face leaving it cadaverous as if already starting to decay As if life had in an instant retreated to some point far inside her leaving the body to its automatic ruin I thought they arrested you Do you mean they let you go  Miss Luft he said this is Mr Resch Phil Resch this is the quite wellknown opera singer Luba Luft To Luba he said The harness bull that arrested me is an android So was his superior Do you knowdid you knowan Inspector Garland He told me that you all came here in one ship as a group The police department which you called Phil Resch said to her operating out of a building on Mission is the organizing agency by which it would appear your group keeps in touch They even feel confident enough to hire a human bounty hunter evidently You Luba Luft said Youre not human No more than I am youre an android too An interval of silence passed and then Phil Resch said in a low but controlled voice Well well deal with that at the proper time To Rick he said Lets take her to my car One of them on each side of her they prodded her in the direction of the museum elevator Luba Luft did not come willingly but on the other hand she did not actively resist seemingly she had become resigned Rick had seen that before in androids in crucial situations The artificial life force animating them seemed to fail if pressed too far  at least in some of them But not all And it could flare up again furiously Androids however had as he knew an innate desire to remain inconspicuous In the museum with so many people roaming around Luba Luft would tend to do nothing The real encounterfor her probably the final onewould take place in the car where no one else could see Alone with appalling abruptness she could shed her inhibitions He prepared himselfand did not think about Phil Resch As Resch had said it would be dealt with at a proper time At the end of the corridor near the elevators a little storelike affair had been set up it sold prints and art books and Luba halted there tarrying Listen she said to Rick Some of the color had returned to her face once more she lookedat least brieflyalive Buy me a reproduction of that picture I was looking at when you found me The one of the girt sitting on the bed After a pause Rick said to the clerk a heavyjowled middleaged woman with netted gray hair Do you have a print of Munchs Puberty  Only in this book of his collected work the clerk said lifting down a handsome glossy volume Twentfive dollars Ill take it He reached for his wallet Phil Resch said My departmental budget could never in a million years be stretched My own money Rick said he handed the woman the bills and Luba the book Now lets get started down he said to her and Phil Resch Its very nice of you Luba said as they entered the elevator Theres something very strange and touching about humans An android would never have done that She glanced icily at Phil Resch It wouldnt have occurred to him as he said never in a million years She continued to gaze at Resch now with manifold hostility and aversion I really dont like androids Ever since I got here from Mars my life has consisted of imitating the human doing what she would do acting as if I had the thoughts and impulses a human would have Imitating as far as Im concerned a superior life form To Phil Resch she said Isnt that how its been with you Resch Trying to be I cant take this Phil Resch dug into his coat groped No Rick said he grabbed at Phil Reschs hand Resch retreated eluding him The Boneli test Rick said Its admitted its an android Phil Resch said We dont have to wait But to retire it Rick said because its needling you give me that He struggled to pry the laser tube away from Phil Resch The tube remained in Phil Reschs possession Resch circled back within the cramped elevator evading him his attention on Luba Luft only Okay Rick said Retire it kill it now Show it that its right He saw then that Resch meant to Wait Phil Resch fired and at the same instant Luba Luft in a spasm of frantic hunted fear twisted and spun away dropping as she did so The beam missed its mark but as Resch lowered it burrowed a narrow hole silently into her stomach She began to scream she lay crouched against the wall of the elevator screaming Like the picture Rick thought to himself and with his own laser tube killed her Luba Lufts body fell forward face down in a heap It did not even tremble With his laser tube Rick systematically burned into blurred ash the book of pictures which he had just a few minutes ago bought Luba He did the job thoroughly saying nothing Phil Resch watched without understanding his face showing his perplexity You could have kept the book yourself Resch said when it had been done That cost you Do you think androids have souls Rick interrupted Cocking his head on one side Phil Resch gazed at him in even greater puzzlement I could afford the book Rick said Ive made three thousand dollars so far today and Im not even half through Youre claiming Garland Phil Resch asked But I killed him not you You just lay there And Luba too I got her You cant collect Rick said Not from your own department and not from ours When we get to your car Ill administer the Boneli test or the VoigtKampff to you and then well see Even though youre not on my list His hands shaking he opened his briefcase rummaged among the crumpled onionskin carbons No youre not here So legally I cant claim you to make anything Ill have to claim Luba Luft and Garland Youre sure Im an android Is that really what Garland said Thats what Garland said Maybe he was lying Phil Resch said To split us apart As we are now Were nuts letting them split us you were absolutely right about Luba LuftI shouldnt have let her get my goat like that I must be overly sensitive That would be natural for a bounty hunter I suppose youre probably the same way But look we would have had to retire Luba Luft anyhow half an hour from nowonly one half hour more She wouldnt even have had time to look through that book you got her And I still think you shouldnt have destroyed it thats a waste I cant follow your reasoning it isnt rational thats why Rick said Im getting out of this business And go into what Anything Insurance underwriting like Garland was supposed to be doing Or Ill emigrate Yes He nodded Ill go to Mars But someone has to do this Phil Resch pointed out They can use androids Much better if andys do it I cant any more Ive had enough She was a wonderful singer The planet could have used her This is insane This is necessary Remember they killed humans in order to get away And if I hadnt gotten you out of the Mission police station they would have killed you Thats what Garland wanted me for thats why he had me come down to his office Didnt Polokov almost kill you Didnt Luba Luft almost Were acting defensively theyre here on our planettheyre murderous illegal aliens masquerading as As police Rick said As bounty hunters Okay give me the Boneli test Maybe Garland lied I think he didfalse memories just arent that good What about my squirrel  Yes your squirrel I forgot about your squirrel If Im an andy Phil Resch said and you kill me you can have my squirrel Here Ill write it out willing it to you Andys cant will anything They cant possess anything to will Then just take it Phil Resch said Maybe so Rick said The elevator had reached the first floor now its doors opened You stay with Luba Ill get a patrol car here to take her to the Hall of justice For her bone marrow test He saw a phone booth entered it dropped in a coin and his fingers shaking dialed Meanwhile a group of people who had been waiting for the elevator gathered around Phil Resch and the body of Luba Luft She was really a superb singer he said to himself as he hung up the receiver his call completed I dont get it how can a talent like that be a liability to our society But it wasnt the talent he told himself it was she herself As Phil Resch is he thought Hes a menace in exactly the same way for the same reasons So I cant quit now Emerging from the phone booth he pushed his way among the people back to Resch and the prone figure of the android girl Someone had put a coat over her Not Reschs Going up to Phil Reschwho stood off to one side vigorously smoking a small gray cigarhe said to him I hope to god you do test out as an android You realty hate me Phil Resch said marveling All of a sudden you didnt hate me back on Mission Street Not while I was saving your life I see a pattern The way you killed Garland and then the way you killed Luba You dont kill the way I do you dont try toHell he said I know what it is You like to kill All you need is a pretext If you had a pretext youd kill me Thats why you picked up on the possibility of Garland being an android it made him available for being killed I wonder what youre going to do when you fail to pass the Boneli test Will you kill yourself Sometimes androids do that But the situation was rare Yes Ill take care of it Phil Resch said You wont have to do anything besides administering the test A patrol car arrived two policemen hopped out strode up saw the crowd of people and at once cleared themselves a passage through One of them recognized Rick and nodded So we can go now Rick realized Our business here is concluded Finally As he and Resch walked back down the street to the opera house on whose roof their hovercar lay parked Resch said Ill give you my laser tube now So you wont have to worry about my reaction to the test In terms of your own personal safety He held out the tube and Rick accepted it Howll you kill yourself without it Rick asked If you fail on the test Ill hold my breath Chrissake Rick said It cant be done Theres no automatic cutin of the vagus nerve Phil Resch said in an android As there is in a human Werent you taught that when they trained you I got taught that years ago But to die that way Rick protested Theres no pain Whats the matter with it Its He gestured Unable to find the right words I dont really think Im going to have to Phil Resch said Together they ascended to the roof of the War Memorial Opera House and Phil Reschs parked hovercar Sliding behind the wheel and closing his door Phil Resch said I would prefer it if you used the Boneli test I cant I dont know how to score it I would have to rely on you for an interpretation of the readings he realized And thats out of the question Youll tell me the truth wont you Phil Resch asked If Im an android youll tell me Sure Because I really want to know I have to know Phil Resch relit his cigar shifted about on the bucket seat of the car trying to make himself comfortable Evidently he could not Did you really like that Munch picture that Luba Luft was looking at he asked I didnt care for it Realism in art doesnt interest me I like Picasso and Puberty dates from 1894 Rick said shortly Nothing but realism existed then you have to take that into account But that other one of the man holding his ears and yellingthat wasnt representational Opening his briefcase Rick fished out his test gear Elaborate Phil Resch observed watching How many questions do you have to ask before you can make a determination Six or seven He handed the adhesive pad to Phil Resch Attach that to your cheek Firmly And this light He aimed it This stays focused on your eye Dont move keep your eyeball as steady as you can Reflex fluctuations Phil Resch said acutely But not to the physical stimulus youre not measuring dilation for instance Itll be to the verbal questions what we call a flinch reaction Rick said Do you think you can control it Not really Eventually maybe But not the initial amplitude thats outside conscious control If it werent He broke off Go ahead Im tense excuse me if I talk too much Talk all you want Rick said Talk all the way to the tomb he said to himself If you feel like it It didnt matter to him If I test out android Phil Resch prattled youll undergo renewed faith in the human race But since its not going to work out that way I suggest you begin framing an ideology which will account for Heres the first question Rick said the gear had now been set up and the needles of the two dials quivered Reaction time is a factor so answer as rapidly as you can From memory he selected an initial question The test had begun Afterward Rick sat in silence for a time Then he began gathering his gear together stuffing it back in the briefcase I can tell by your face Phil Resch said he exhaled in absolute weightless almost convulsive relief Okay you can give me my gun back He reached out his palm up waiting Evidently you were right Rick said About Garlands motives Wanting to split us up what you said He felt both psychologically and physically weary Do you have your ideology framed Phil Resch asked That would explain me as part of the human race Rick said There is a defect in your empathic roletaking ability One which we dont test for Your feelings toward androids Of course we dont test for that Maybe we should He had never thought of it before had never felt any empathy on his own part toward the androids he killed Always fie had assumed that throughout his psyche he experienced the android as a clever machineas in his conscious view And yet in contrast to Phil Resch a difference had manifested itself And he felt instinctively that he was right Empathy toward an artificial construct he asked himself Something that only pretends to be alive But Luba Luft had seemed genuinely alive it had not worn the aspect of a simulation You realize Phil Resch said quietly what this would do If we included androids in our range of empathic identification as we do animals We couldnt protect ourselves Absolutely These Nexus6 types  theyd roll all over us and mash us flat You and I all the bounty hunterswe stand between the Nexus6 and mankind a barrier which keeps the two distinct Furthermore He ceased noticing that Rick was once again hauling out his test gear I thought the test was over I want to ask myself a question Rick said And I want you to tell me what the needles register Just give me the calibration I can compute it He plastered the adhesive disk against his cheek arranged the beam of light until it fed directly into his eye Are you ready Watch the dials Well exclude time lapse in this I just want magnitude Sure Rick Phil Resch said obligingly Aloud Rick said Im going down by elevator with an android Ive captured And suddenly someone kills it without warning No particular response Phil Resch said Whatd the needles hit The left one 28 The right one 33 Rick said A female android Now theyre up to 40 and 6 respectively Thats high enough Rick said he removed the wired adhesive disk from his cheek and shut off the beam of light Thats an emphatically empathic response he said About what a human subject shows for most questions Except for the extreme ones such as those dealing with human pelts used decoratively  the truly pathological ones Meaning Rick said Im capable of feeling empathy for at least specific certain androids Not for all of them butone or two For Luba Luft as an example he said to himself So I was wrong Theres nothing unnatural or unhuman about Phil Reschs reactions its me  I wonder he wondered if any human has ever felt this way before about an android Of course he reflected this may never come up again in my work it could be an anomaly something for instance to do with my feelings for The Magic Flute  And for Lubas voice in fact her career as a whole Certainly this had never come up before or at least not that he had been aware of Not for example with Polokov Nor with Garland And he realized if Phil Resch had proved out android I could have killed him without feeling anything anyhow after Lubas death So much for the distinction between authentic living humans and humanoid constructs In that elevator at the museum he said to himself I rode down with two creatures one human the other android  and my feelings were the reverse of those intended Of those Im accustomed to feelam required to feel Youre in a spot Deckard Phil Resch said it seemed to amuse him Rick said Whatshould I do Its sex Phil Resch said Sex Because sheitwas physically attractive Hasnt that ever happened to you before Phil Resch laughed We were taught that it constitutes a prime problem in bounty hunting Dont you know Deckard that in the colonies they have android mistresses Its illegal Rick said knowing the law about that Sure its illegal But most variations in sex are illegal But people do it anvhow What aboutnot sexbut love Love is another name for sex Like love of country Rick said Love of music If its love toward a woman or an android imitation its sex Wake up and face yourself Deckard You wanted to go to bed with a female type of androidnothing more nothing less I felt that way on one occasion When I had just started bounty hunting Dont let it get you down youll heal Whats happened is that youve got your order reversed Dont kill heror be present when shes killedand then feel physically attracted Do it the other way Rick stared at him Go to bed with her first and then kill her Phil Resch said succinctly His grainy hardened smile remained Youre a good bounty hunter Rick realized Your attitude proves it But am I Suddenly for the first time in his life he had begun to wonder CHAPTER 13 Like an arc of pure fire John R Isidore soared across the lateafternoon sky on his way home from his job I wonder if shes still there he said to himself Down in that kippleinfested old apt watching Buster Friendly on her TV set and quaking with fear every time she imagines someone coming down the hall Including I suppose me He had already stopped off at a blackmarket grocery store On the seat beside him a bag of such delicacies as bean curd ripe peaches good soft evilsmelling cheese rocked back and forth as he alternately speeded up and slowed down his car being tense tonight he drove somewhat erratically And his allegedly repaired car coughed and floundered as it had been doing for months prior to overhaul Rats Isidore said to himself The smell of peaches and cheese eddied about the car filling his nose with pleasure All rarities for which he had squandered two weeks salaryborrowed in advance from Mr Sloat And in addition under the car seat where it could not roll and break a bottle of Chablis wine knocked back and forth the greatest rarity of all He had been keeping it in a safety deposit box at the Bank of America hanging onto it and not selling it no matter how much they offered in case at some long late last moment a girl appeared That had not happened not until now The rubbishlittered lifeless roof of his apartment building as always depressed him Passing from his car to the elevator door he damped down his peripheral vision he concentrated on the valuable bag and bottle which he carried making certain that he tripped over no trash and took no ignominious pratfall to economic doom When the elevator creakily arrived he rode itnot to his own floorbut to the lower level on which the new tenant Pris Stratton now lived Presently he stood in front of her door rapping with the edge of the wine bottle his heart going to pieces inside his chest Whos there Her voice muffled by the door and yet clear A frightened but bladesharp tone This is J R Isidore speaking he said briskly adopting the new authority which he had so recently acquired via Mr Sloats vidphone I have a few desirable items here and I think we can put together a more than reasonable dinner The door to a limited extent opened Pris no lights on in the room behind her peered out into the dim hall You sound different she said More grown up I had a few routine matters to deal with during business hours today The usual If you cccould let me in Youd talk about them However she held the door open wide enough for him to enter And then seeing what he carried she exclaimed her face ignited with elfin exuberant glee But almost at once without warning a lethal bitterness crossed her features set concretelike in place The glee had gone What is it he said he carried the packages and bottle to the kitchen set them down and hurried back Tonelessly Pris said Theyre wasted on me Why Oh She shrugged walking aimlessly away her hands in the pockets of her heavy rather oldfashioned skirt Sometime Ill tell you She raised her eyes then It was nice of you anyhow Now I wish youd leave I dont feel like seeing anyone In a vague fashion she moved toward the door to the hall her steps dragged and she seemed depleted her store of energy fading almost out I know whats the matter with you he said Oh Her voice as she reopened the hall door dropped even further into uselessness listless and barren You dont have any friends Youre a lot worse than when I saw you this morning its because I have friends Sudden authority stiffened her voice she palpably regained vigor Or I had Seven of them That was to start with but now the bounty hunters have had time to get to work So some of themmaybe all of themare dead She wandered toward the window gazed out at the blackness and the few lights here and there I may be the only one of the eight of us left So maybe youre right Whats a bounty hunter Thats right You people arent supposed to know A bounty hunter is a professional murderer whos given a list of those hes supposed to kill Hes paid a suma thousand dollars is the going rate I understandfor each he gets Usually he has a contract with a city so he draws a salary as well But they keep that low so hell have incentive Are you sure Isidore asked Yes She nodded You mean am I sure he has incentive Yes he has incentive He enjoys it I think Isidore said Youre mistaken Never in his life had he heard of such a thing Buster Friendly for instance had never mentioned it Its not in accord with presentday Mercerian ethics he pointed out All life is one no man is an island as Shakespeare said in olden times John Donne Isidore gestured in agitation Thats worse than anything I ever heard of Cant you call the police No And theyre after you Theyre apt to come here and kill you He understood now why the girl acted in so secretive a fashion No wonder youre scared and dont want to see anybody But he thought It must be a delusion She must be psychotic With delusions of persecution Maybe from brain damage due to the dust maybe shes a special Ill get them first he said With what Faintly she smiled she showed her small even white teeth Ill get a license to carry a laser beam Its easy to get out here where theres hardly anybody the police dont patrolyoure expected to watch out for yourself How about when youre at work Ill take a leave of absence Pris said Thats very nice of you J R Isidore But if bounty hunters got the others got Max Polokov and Garland and Luba and Hasking and Roy Baty She broke off Roy and Irmgard Baty If theyre dead then it really doesnt matter Theyre my best friends Why the hell dont I hear from them I wonder She cursed angrily Making his way into the kitchen he got down dusty long unused plates and bowls and glasses he began washing them in the sink running the rusty hot water until it clearedat last Presently Pris appeared seated herself at the table He uncorked the bottle of Chablis divided the peaches and the cheese and the bean curd Whats that white stuff Not the cheese She pointed Made from soy bean whey I wish I had some He broke off flushing It used to be eaten with beef gravy An android Pris murmured Thats the sort of slip an android makes Thats what gives it away She came over stood beside him and then to his stunned surprise put her arm around his waist and for an instant pressed against him Ill try a slice of peach she said and gingerly picked out a slippery pinkorange furry slice with her long fingers And then as she ate the slice of peach she began to cry Cold tears descended her cheeks splashed on the bosom of her dress He did not know what to do so he continued dividing the food Goddamn it she said furiously Well She moved away from him paced slowly with measured steps about the room see we lived on Mars Thats how come I know androids Her voice shook but she managed to continue obviously it meant a great deal to her to have someone to talk to And the only people on Earth that you know Isidore said are your fellow exemigrants We knew each other before the trip A settlement near New New York Roy Baty and Irmgard ran a drugstore he was a pharmacist and she handled the beauty aids the creams and ointments on Mars they use a lot of skin conditioners I She hesitated I got various drugs from RoyI needed them at first becausewell anyhow its an awful place This she swept in the room the apartment in one violent gesture this is nothing You think Im suffering because Im lonely Hell all Mars is lonely Much worse than this Dont the androids keep you company I heard a commercial on Seating himself he ate and presently she too picked up the glass of wine she sipped expressionlessly I understood that the androids helped The androids she said are lonely too Do you like the wine She set down her glass Its fine Its the only bottle Ive seen in three years We came back Pris said because nobody should have to live there It wasnt conceived for habitation at least not within the last billion years Its so old  You feel it in the stones the terrible old age Anyhow at first I got drugs from Roy I lived for that new synthetic painkiller that silenizine And then I met Horst Hartman who at that time ran a stamp store rare postage stamps theres so much time on your hands that youve got to have a hobby something you can pore over endlessly And Horst got me interested in precolonial fiction You mean old books Stories written before space travel but about space travel How could there have been stories about space travel before The writers Pris said made it up Based on what On imagination A lot of times they turned out wrong For example they wrote about Venus being a jungle paradise with huge monsters and women in breastplates that glistened She eyed him Does that interest you Big women with long braided blond hair and gleaming breastplates the size of melons No he said Irmgard is blond Pris said But small Anyhow theres a fortune to be made in smuggling precolonial fiction the old magazines and books and films to Mars Nothing is as exciting To read about cities and huge industrial enterprises and really successful colonization You can imagine what it might have been like What Mars ought to be like Canals Canals Dimly he remembered reading about that in the olden days they had believed in canals on Mars Crisscrossing the planet Pris said And beings from other stars With infinite wisdom And stories about Earth set in our time and even later Where theres no radioactive dust I would think Isidore said it would make you feel worse It doesnt Pris said curtly Did you bring any of that precolonial reading material back with you  It occurred to him that he ought to try some Its worthless here because here on Earth the craze never caught on Anyhow theres plenty here in the libraries thats where we get all of oursstolen from libraries here on Earth and shot by autorocket to Mars Youre out at night humbling across the open space and all of a sudden you see a flare and theres a rocket cracked open with old precolonial fiction magazines spilling out everywhere A fortune But of course you read them before you sell them She warmed to her topic Of all A knock sounded on the hall door Ashen Pris whispered I cant go Dont make any noise just sit She strained listening I wonder if the doors locked she said almost inaudibly God I hope so Her eyes wild and powerful fixed themselves beseechingly on him as if praying to him to make it true A faroff voice from the hall called Pris are you in there A mans voice Its Roy and Irmgard We got your card Rising and going into the bedroom Pris reappeared carrying a pen and scrap of paper she reseated herself scratched out a hasty message YOU GO TO THE DOOR Isidore nervously took the pen from her and wrote AND SAY WHAT With anger Pris scratched out SEE IF ITS REALLY THEM Getting up he walked glumly into the living room How would I know if it was them he inquired of himself He opened the door Two people stood in the dim hall a small woman lovely in the manner of Greta Garbo with blue eyes and yellowblond hair the man larger with intelligent eyes but flat Mongolian features which gave him a brutal look The woman wore a fashionable wrap high shiny boots and tapered pants the man lounged in a rumpled shirt and stained trousers giving an air of almost deliberate vulgarity He smiled at Isidore but his bright small eyes remained oblique Were looking the small blond woman began but then she saw past Isidore her face dissolved in rapture and she whisked past him calling Pris How are you Isidore turned The two women were embracing He stepped aside and Roy Baty entered somber and large smiling his crooked tuneless smile CHAPTER 14 Can we talk Roy said indicating Isidore Pris vibrant with bliss said Its okay up to a point To Isidore she said Excuse us She led the Batys off to one side and muttered at them then the three of them returned to confront J R Isidore who felt uncomfortable and out of place This is Mr Isidore Pris said Hes taking care of me The words came out tinged with an almost malicious sarcasm Isidore blinked See He brought me some natural food Food Irmgard Baty echoed and trotted lithely into the kitchen to see Peaches she said immediately picking up a bowl and spoon smiling at Isidore she ate with brisk little animal bites Her smile different from Priss provided simple warmth it had no veiled overtones Going after herhe felt attracted to herIsidore said Youre from Mars Yes we gave up Her voice bobbed as with birdish acumen her blue eyes sparkled at him What an awful building you live in Nobody else lives here do they We didnt see any other fights I live upstairs Isidore said Oh I thought you and Pris were maybe living together Irmgard Baty did not sound disapproving she meant it obviously as merely a statement Dourlybut still smiling his smileRoy Baty said Well they got Polokov The joy which had appeared on Priss face at seeing her friends at once melted away Who else They got Garland Roy Baty said They got Anders and Gitchel and then just a little earlier today they got Luba He delivered the news as if perversely it pleased him to be telling this As if he derived pleasure from Priss shock I didnt think theyd get Luba remember I kept saying that during the trip So that leaves Pris said The three of us Irmgard said with apprehensive urgency Thats why were here Roy Batys voice boomed out with new unexpected warmth the worse the situation the more he seemed to enjoy it Isidore could not fathom him in the slightest Oh god Pris said stricken Well they had this investigator this bounty hunter Irmgard said in agitation named Dave Holden Her lips dripped venom at the name And then Polokov almost got him Almost got him Roy echoed his smile now immense So hes in this hospital this Holden Irmgard continued And evidently they gave his list to another bounty hunter and Polokov almost got him too But it wound up with him retiring Polokov And then he went after Luba we know that because she managed to get hold of Garland and he sent out someone to capture the bounty hunter and take him to the Mission Street building See Luba called us after Garlands agent picked up the bounty hunter She was sure it would be okay she was sure that Garland would la him She added But evidently something went wrong on Mission We dont know what Maybe we never will Pris asked Does this bounty hunter have our names Oh yes dear I suppose he does Irmgard said But he doesnt know where we are Roy and I arent going back to our apartment we have as much stuff in our car as we could cram in and weve decided to take one of these abandoned apartments in this ratty old building Is that wise Isidore spoke up summoning courage Ttto all be in one place Well they got everybody else Irmgard said matteroffactly she too like her husband seemed strangely resigned despite her superficial agitation All of them Isidore thought theyre all strange He sensed it without being able to finger it As if a peculiar and malign abstractness pervaded their mental processes Except perhaps for Pris certainly she was radically frightened Pris seemed almost right almost natural But Why dont you move in with him Roy said to Pris indicating Isidore He could give you a certain amount of protection A chickenhead Pris said Im not going to live with a chickenhead Her nostrils flared Irmgard said rapidly I think youre foolish to be a snob at a time like this Bounty hunters move fast he may try to tie it up this evening There may be a bonus in it for him if he got it done by Keerist close the hall door Roy said going over to it he slammed it with one blow of his hand thereupon summarily locking it I think you should move in with Isidore Pris and I think Irm and I should be here in the same building that way we can help each other Ive got some electronic components in my car junk I ripped off the ship Ill install a twoway bug so Pris you can hear us and we can hear you and Ill rig up an alarm system that any of the four of us can set off Its obvious that the synthetic identities didnt work out even Garlands Of course Garland put his head in the noose by bringing the bounty hunter to the Mission Street building that was a mistake And Polokov instead of staying as far away as possible from the hunter chose to approach him We wont do that well stay put He did not sound worried in the slightest the situation seemed to rouse him to crackling nearmanic energy I think He sucked in his breath noisily holding the attention of everyone else in the room including Isidore I think that theres a reason why the three of us are still alive I think if he had any clue as to where we are hed have shown up here by now The whole idea in bounty hunting is to work as fast as hell Thats where the profit comes And if he waits Irmgard said in agreement we slip away like weve done I bet Roy is right I bet he has our names but no location Poor Luba stuck in the War Memorial Opera House right out in the open No difficulty finding her Well Roy said stiltedly she wanted it that way she believed shed be safer as a public figure You told her otherwise Irmgard said Yes Roy agreed I told her and I told Polokov not to try to pass himself off as a WPO man And I told Garland that one of his own bounty hunters would get him which is very possibly just conceivably exactly what did happen He rocked back and forth on his heavy heels his face wise with profundity Isidore spoke up III gather from lllistening to Mr Baty that hes your nnnatural leader Oh yes Roys a leader Irmgard said Pris said He organized our trip From Mars to here Then Isidore said you better do what hhhe suggests His voice broke with hope and tension I think it would be ttterrific Pris if you 1llived with me Ill stay home a couple of days from my jobI have a vacation coming To make sure youre okay And maybe Milt who was very inventive could design a weapon for him to use Something imaginative which would slay bounty hunters  whatever they were He had an indistinct glimpsed darkly impression of something merciless that carried a printed list and a gun that moved machinelike through the flat bureaucratic job of killing A thing without emotions or even a face a thing that if killed got replaced immediately by another resembling it And so on until everyone real and alive had been shot Incredible he thought that the police cant do anything I cant believe that These people must have done something  Perhaps they emigrated back to Earth illegally Were toldthe TV tells usto report any landing of a ship outside the approved pads The police must be watching for this But even so no one got killed deliberately any more It ran contrary to Mercerism The chickenhead Pris said likes me Dont call him that Pris Irmgard said she gave Isidore a look of compassion Think what he could call you  Pris said nothing Her expression became enigmatic Ill go start rigging up the bug Roy said Irmgard and Ill stay in this apartment Pris you go withMr Isidore He started toward the door striding with amazing speed for a man so heavy In a blur he disappeared out the door which banged back as he flung it open Isidore then had a momentary strange hallucination he saw briefly a frame of metal a platform of pullies and circuits and batteries and turrets and gearsand then the slovenly shape of Roy Baty faded back into view Isidore felt a laugh rise up inside him he nervously choked it off And felt bewildered A man  Pris said distantly of action Too bad hes so poor with his hands doing mechanical things If we get saved Irmgard said in a scolding severe tone as if chiding her itll be because of Roy But is it worth it Pris said mostly to herself She shrugged then nodded to Isidore Okay J R Ill move in with you and you can protect me Aaall of you Isidore said immediately Solemnly in a formal little voice Irmgard Baty said to him I want you to know we appreciate it very much Mr Isidore Youre the first friend I think any of us have found here on Earth Its very nice of you and maybe sometime we can repay you She glided over to pat him on the arm Do you have any precolonial fiction I could read he asked her Pardon Irmgard Baty glanced inquiringly at Pris Those old magazines Pris said she had gathered a few things together to take with her and Isidore lifted the bundle from her arms feeling the glow that comes only from satisfaction at a goal achieved No JR We didnt bring any back with us for reasons I explained Ill gggo to a library tomorrow he said going out into the hall And gget you and me too some to read so youll have something to do besides just waiting He led Pris upstairs to his own apartment dark and empty and stuffy and lukewarm as it was carrying her possessions into the bedroom he at once turned on the heater lights and the TV to its sole channel I like this Pris said but in the same detached and remote toneas before She meandered about hands thrust in her skirt pockets on her face a sour expression almost righteous in the degree of its displeasure appeared In contrast to her stated reaction Whats the matter he asked as he laid her possessions out on the couch Nothing She halted at the picture window drew the drapes back and gazed morosely out If you think theyre looking for you he began Its a dream Pris said Induced by drugs that Roy gave me Ppardon You really think that bounty hunters exist Mr Baty said they killed your friends Roy Baty is as crazy as I am Pris said Our trip was between a mental hospital on the East Coast and here Were all schizophrenic with defective emotional livesflattening of affect its called And we have group hallucinations I didnt think it was true he said full of relief Why didnt you She swiveled to stare intently at him her scrutiny was so strict that he felt himself flushing Bbbecause things like that dont happen The ggovernment never kills anyone for any crime And Mercerism But you see Pris said if youre not human then its all different Thats not true Even animalseven eels and gophers and snakes and spidersare sacred Pris still regarding him fixedly said So it cant be can it As you say even animals are protected by law All life Everything organic that wriggles or squirms or burrows or flies or swarms or lays eggs or She broke off because Roy Baty had appeared abruptly throwing the door of the apartment open and entering a trail of wire rustled after him Insects he said showing no embarrassment at overhearing them are especially sacrosanct Lifting a picture rom the wall of the living room he attached a small electronic device to the nail stepped back viewed it then replaced the picture Now the alarm He gathered up the trailing wire which led to a complex assembly Smiling his discordant smile he showed the assembly to Pris and John Isidore The alarm These wires go under the carpet theyre antennae It picks up the presence of a He hesitated A mentational entity he said obscurely which isnt one of us four So it rings Pris said and then what Hell have a gun We cant fall on him and bite him to death This assembly Roy continued has a Penfield unit built into it When the alarm has been triggered it radiates a mood of panic to theintruder Unless he acts very fast which he may Enormous panic I have the gain turned all the way up No human being can remain in the vicinity more than a matter of seconds Thats the nature of panic it leads to random circusmotions purposeless flight and muscle and neural spasms He concluded Which will give us an opportunity to get him Possibly Depending on how good he is Isidore said Wont the alarm affect us Thats right Pris said to Roy Baty Itll affect Isidore Well so what Roy said And resumed his task of installation So they both go racing out of here panicstricken Itll still give us time to react And they wont kill Isidore hes not on their list Thats why hes usable as a cover Pris said brusquely You cant do any better Roy No he answered I cant Ill be able to ggget a weapon tomorrow Isidore spoke up Youre sure Isidores presence here wont set off the alarm Pris said After all hesyou know Ive compensated for his cephalic emanations Roy explained Their sum wont trip anything itll take an additional human Person Scowling he glanced at Isidore aware of what he had said Youre androids Isidore said But he didnt care it made no difference to him I see why they want to kill you he said Actually youre not alive Everything made sense to him now The bounty hunter the killing of their friends the trip to Earth all these precautions When I used the word human Roy Baty said to Pris I used the wrong word Thats right Mr Baty Isidore said But what does it matter to me I mean Im a special they dont treat me very well either like for instance I cant emigrate He found himself yabbering away like a folletto You cant come here I cant He calmed himself After a pause Roy Baty said laconically You wouldnt enjoy Mars Youre missing nothing I wondered how long it would be Pris said to Isidore before you realized We are different arent we Thats what probably tripped up Garland and Max Polokov Roy Baty said They were so goddamn sure they could pass Luba too Youre intellectual Isidore said he felt excited again at having understood Excitement and pride You think abstractly and you dont He gesticulated his words tangling up with one another As usual I wish I had an IQ like you have then I could pass the test I wouldnt be a chickenhead I think youre very superior I could learn a lot from you After an interval Roy Baty said Ill finish wiring up the alarm He resumed work He doesnt understand yet Pris said in a sharp brittle stentorian voice how we got off Mars What we did there What we couldnt help doing Roy Baty grunted At the open door to the hall Irmgard Baty had been standing they noticed her as she spoke up I dont think we have to worry about Mr Isidore she said earnestly she walked swiftly toward him looked up into his face They dont treat him very well either as he said And what we did on Mars he isnt interested in he knows us and he likes us and an emotional acceptance like thatits everything to him Its hard for us to grasp that but its true To Isidore she said standing very close to him once again and peering up at him You could get a lot of money by turning us in do you realize that Twisting she said to her husband See he realizes that but still he wouldnt say anything Youre a great man Isidore Pris said Youre a credit to your race If he was an android Roy said heartily hed turn us in about ten tomorrow morning Hed take off for his job and that would be it Im overwhelmed with admiration His tone could not be deciphered at least Isidore could not crack it And we imagined this would be a friendless world a planet of hostile faces all turned against us He barked out a laugh Im not at all worried Irmgard said You ought to be seared to the soles of your feet Roy said Lets vote Pris said As we did on the ship when we had a disagreement Well Irmgard said I wont say anything more But if we turn this down I dont think well find any other human being wholl take us in and help us Mr Isidore is She searched for the word Special Pris said CHAPTER 15 Solemnly and with ceremony the vote was taken We stay here Irmgard said with firmness In this apartment in this building Roy Baty said I vote we kill Mr Isidore and hide somewhere else He and his wifeand John Isidorenow turned tautly toward Pris In a low voice Pris said I vote we make our stand here She added more loudly I think JRs value to us outweighs his danger that of his knowing Obviously we cant live among humans without being discovered thats what killed Polokov and Garland and Luba and Anders Thats what killed all of them Maybe they did just what were doing Roy Baty said Confided in trusted one given human being who they believed was different As you said special We dont know that Irmgard said Thats only a conjecture I think they they She gestured Walked around Sang from a stage like Luba We trustIll tell you what we trust that fouls us up Roy its our goddamn superior intelligence She glared at her husband her small high breasts rising and falling rapidly Were so smart Roy youre doing it right now goddamn you youre doing it now  Pris said I think Irms right So we hang our lives on a substandard blighted Roy began then gave up Im tired he said simply Its been a long trip Isidore But not very long here Unfortunately I hope Isidore said happily I can help make your stay here on Earth pleasant He felt sure he could It seemed to him a cinch the culmination of his whole lifeand of the new authority which he had manifested on the vidphone today at work As soon as he officially quit work that evening Rick Deckard flew across town to animal row the several blocks of bigtime animal dealers with their huge glass windows and lurid signs The new and horribly unique depression which had floored him earlier in the day had not left This his activity here with animals and animal dealers seemed the only weak spot in the shroud of depression a flaw by which he might be able to grab it and exorcise it In the past anyhow the sight of animals the scent of money deals with expensive stakes had done much for him Maybe it would accomplish as much now Yes sit a nattily dressed new animal salesman said to him chattily as he stood gaping with a sort of glazed meek need at the displays See anything you like Rick said I see a lot I like Its the cost that bothers me You tell us the deal you want to make the salesman said What you want to take home with you and how you want to pay for it Well take the package to our sales manager and get his big okay Ive got three thou cash The department at the end of the day had paid him his bounty How much he asked is that family of rabbits over there Sir if you have a down payment of three thou I can make you owner of something a lot better than a pair of rabbits What about a goat I havent thought much about goats Rick said May I ask if this represents a new price bracket for you Well I dont usually carry around three thou Rick conceded I thought as much sit when you mentioned rabbits The thing about rabbits sit is that everybody has one Id like to see you step up to the goatclass where I feel you belong Frankly you look more like a goat man to me What are the advantages to goats The animal salesman said The distinct advantage of a goat is that it can be taught to butt anyone who tries to steal it Not if they shoot it with a hypnodart and descend by rope ladder from a hovering hovercar Rick said The salesman undaunted continued A goat is loyal And it has a free natural soul which no cage can chain up And there is one exceptional additional feature about goats one which you may not be aware of Often times when you invest in an animal and take it home you find some morning that its eaten something radioactive and died A goat isnt bothered by contaminated quasifoodstuffs it can eat eclectically even items that would fell a cow or a horse or most especially a cat As a long term investment we feel that the goatespecially the femaleoffers unbeatable advantages to the serious animalowner Is this goat a female He had noticed a big black goat standing squarely in the center of its cage he moved that way and the salesman accompanied him The goat it seemed to Rick was beautiful Yes this goat is a female A black Nubian goat very large as you can see This is a superb contender in this years market sir And were offering her at an attractive unusually low low price Getting out his creased Sidneys Rick looked up the listing on goats black Nubian Will this be a cash deal the salesman asked Or are you trading in a used animal All cash Rick said On a slip of paper the salesman scribbled a price and then briefly almost furtively showed it to Rick too much Rick said He took the slip of paper and wrote down a more modest figure We couldnt let a goat go for that the salesman protested He wrote another figure This goat is less than a year old she has a very long life expectancy He showed the figure to Rick Its a deal Rick said He signed the timepayment contract paid over his three thousand dollarshis entire bounty moneyas down payment and shortly found himself standing by his hovercar rather dazed as employees of the animal dealer loaded the crate of goat into the car I own an animal now he said to himself A living animal not electric For the second time in my life The expense the contractual indebtedness appalled him he found himself shaking But I had to do it he said to himself The experience with Phil ReschI have to get my confidence my faith in myself and my abilities back Or I wont keep my job His hands numb he guided the hovercar up into the sky and headed for his apartment and Iran Shell be angry he said to himself Because itll worry her the responsibility And since shes home all day a lot of the maintenance will fall to her Again he felt dismal When he had landed on the roof of his building he sat for a time weaving together in his mind a story thick with verisimilitude My job requires it he thought scraping bottom Prestige We couldnt go on with the electric sheep any longer it sapped my morale Maybe I can tell her that he decided Climbing from the car he maneuvered the goat cage from the back seat with wheezing effort managed to set it down on the roof The goat which had slid about during the transfer regarded him with brighteyed perspicacity but made no sound He descended to his floor followed a familiar path down the hall to his own door Hi Iran greeted him busy in the kitchen with dinner Why so late tonight Come up to the roof he said I want to show you something You bought an animal  She removed her apron smoothed back her hair reflexively and followed him out of the apartment they progressed down the hall with huge eager strides You shouldnt have gotten it without me Iran gasped I have a right to participate in the decision the most important acquisition well ever I wanted it to be a surprise he said You made some bounty money today Iran said accusingly Rick said Yes I retired three andys He entered the elevator and together they moved nearer to god I had to buy this he said Something went wrong today something about retiring them It wouldnt have been possible for me to go on without getting an animal The elevator had reached the roof he led his wife out into the evening darkness to the cage switching on the spotlightsmaintained for the use of all building residentshe pointed to the goat silently Waiting for her reaction Oh my god Iran said softly She walked to the cage peered in then she circled around it viewing the goat from every angle Is it really real she asked Its not false Absolutely real he said Unless they swindled me But that rarely happened the fine for counterfeiting would be enormoustwo and a half times the full market value of the genuine animal No they didnt swindle me Its a goat Iran said A black Nubian goat Female Rick said So maybe later on we can mate her And well get milk out of which we can make cheese Can we let her out Put her where the sheep is She ought to be tethered he said For a few days at least Iran said in an odd little voice My life is love and pleasure An old old song by Josef Strauss Remember When we first met She put her hand gently on his shoulder leaned toward him and kissed him Much love And very much pleasure Thanks he said and hugged her Lets run downstairs and give thanks to Mercer Then we can come up here again and right away name her she needs a name And maybe you can find some rope to tether her She started off Standing by his horse Judy grooming and currying her their neighbor Bill Barbour called to them Hey thats a nicelooking goat you have Deckards Congratulations Evening Mrs Deckard Maybe youll have kids Ill maybe trade you my colt for a couple of kids Thanks Rick said He followed after Iran in the direction of the elevator Does this cure your depression he asked her It cures mine Iran said It certainly does cure my depression Now we can admit to everybody that the sheeps false No need to do that he said cautiously But we can  Iran persisted See now we have nothing to hide what weve always wanted has come true Its a dream Once more she stood on tiptoe leaning and nimbly kissing him her breath eager and erratic tickled his neck She reached then to stab at the elevator button Something warned him Something made him say Lets not go down to the apartment yet Lets stay up here with the goat Lets just sit and look at her and maybe feed the goat something They gave me a bag of oats to start us out And we can read the manual on goat maintenance they included that too at no extra charge We can call her Euphemia The elevator however had come and already Iran was trotting inside Iran wait he said It would be immoral not to fuse with Mercer in gratitude Iran said I had hold of the handles of the box today and it overcame my depression a littlejust a little not like this But anyhow I got hit by a rock here She held up her wrist on it he made out a small dark bruise And I remember thinking how much better we are how much better off when were with Mercer Despite the pain Physical pain but spiritually together I felt everyone else all over the world all who had fused at the same time She held the elevator door from sliding shut Get in Rick Thisll be just for a moment You hardly ever undergo fusion I want you to transmit the mood youre in now to everyone else you owe it to them It would be immoral to keep it for ourselves She was of course right So he entered the elevator and once again descended In their living room at the empathy box Iran swiftly snapped the switch her face animated with growing gladness it lit her up like a rising new crescent of moon I want everyone to know she told him Once that happened to me I fused and picked up someone who had just acquired an animal And then one day Her features momentarily darkened the pleasure fled One day I found myself receiving from someone whose animal had died But others of us shared our different joys with themI didnt have any as you might knowand that cheered the person up We might even reach a potential suicide what we have what were feeling might Theyll have our joy Rick said but well lose Well exchange what we feel for what they feel Our joy will be lost The screen of the empathy box now showed rushing streams of bright formless color taking a breath his wife hung on tightly to the two handles We wont really lose what we feel not if we keep it clearly in mind You never really have gotten the hang of fusion have you Rick Guess not he said But now he had begun to sense for the first time the value that people such as Iran obtained from Mercerism Possibly his experience with the bounty hunter Phil Resch had altered some minute synapsis in him had closed one neurological switch and opened another And this perhaps had started a chain reaction Iran he said urgently he drew her away from the empathy box Listen I want to talk about what happened to me today He led her over to the couch sat her down facing him I met another bounty hunter he said One I never saw before A predatory one who seemed to like to destroy them For the first time after being with him I looked at them differently I mean in my own way I had been viewing them as he did Wont this wait Iran said Rick said I took a test one question and verified it Ive begun to empathize with androids and look what that means You said it this morning yourself Those poor andys So you know what Im talking about Thats why I bought the goat I never felt like that before Maybe it could be a depression like you get I can understand now how you suffer when youre depressed I always thought you liked it and I thought you could have snapped yourself out any time if not alone then by means of the mood organ But when you get that depressed you dont care Apathy because youve lost a sense of worth It doesnt matter whether you feet better because if you have no worth What about your job Her tone jabbed at him he blinked Your job  Iran repeated What are the monthly payments on the goat She held out her hand reflexively he got out the contract which he had signed passed it to her That much she said in a thin voice The interest good godthe interest alone And you did this because you were depressed Not as a surprise for me as you originally said She handed the contract back to him Well it doesnt matter Im still glad you got the goat I love the goat But its such an economic burden She looked gray Rick said I can get switched to some other desk The department does ten or eleven separate jobs Animal theft I could transfer to that But the bounty money We need it or theyll repossess the goat  Ill get the contract extended from thirtysix months to fortyeight He whipped out a ballpoint pen scribbled rapidly on the back of the contract That way itll be fiftytwo fifty less a month The vidphone rang If we hadnt come back down here Rick said if wed stayed up on the roof with the goat we wouldnt have gotten this call Going to the vidphone Iran said Why are you afraid Theyre not repossessing the goat not yet She started to lift the receiver Its the department he said Say Im not here He headed for the bedroom Hello Iran said into the receiver Three more andys Rick thought to himself that I should have followed up on today instead of coming home On the vidscreen Harry Bryants face had formed so it was too late to get away He walked with stiff leg muscles back toward the phone Yes hes here Iran was saying We bought a goat Come over and see it Mr Bryant A pause as she listened and then she held the receiver up to Rick He has something he wants to say to you she said Going over to the empathy box she quickly seated herself and once more gripped the twin handles She became involved almost at once Rick stood holding the phone receiver conscious of her mental departure Conscious of his own aloneness Hello he said into the receiver We have a tail on two of the remaining androids Harry Bryant said He was calling from his office Rick saw the familiar desk the litter of documents and papers and kipple Obviously theyve become alertedtheyve left the address Dave gave you and now they can be found at  wait Bryant groped about on his desk at last located the material he wanted Automatically Rick searched for his pen he held the goatpayment contract on his knee and prepared to write Conapt Building 3967C Inspector Bryant said Get over there as soon as you can We have to assume they know about the ones you picked off Garland and Luft and Polokov thats why theyve taken unlawful flight Unlawful Rick repeated To save their lives Iran says you bought a goat Bryant said Just today After you left work On my way home Ill come and look at your goat after you retire the remaining androids By the wayI talked to Dave just now I told him the trouble they gave you he says congratulations and be more careful He says the Nexus6 types are smarter than he thought In fact he couldnt believe you got three in one day Three is enough Rick said I cant do anything more I have to rest By tomorrow theyll be gone Inspector Bryant said Out of our jurisdiction Not that soon Theyll still be around Bryant said You get over there tonight Before they get dug in They wont expect you to move in so fast Sure they will Rick said Theyll be waiting for me Got the shakes Because of what Polokov I havent got the shakes Rick said Then whats wrong Okay Rick said Ill get over there He started to hang up the phone Let me know as soon as you get results Ill be here in my office Rick said If I get them Im going to buy a sheep You have a sheep Youve had one as long as Ive known you Its electric Rick said He hung up A real sheep this time he said to himself I have to get one In compensation At the black empathy box his wife crouched her face rapt He stood beside her for a time his hand resting on her breast he felt it rise and fall the life in her the activity Iran did not notice him the experience with Mercer had as always become complete On the screen the faint old robed figure of Mercer toiled upward and all at once a rock sailed past him Watching Rick thought My god theres something worse about my situation than his Mercer doesnt have to do anything alien to him He suffers but at least he isnt required to violate his own identity Bending he gently removed his wifes fingers from the twin handles He then himself took her place For the first time in weeks An impulse he hadnt planned it all at once it had happened A landscape of weeds confronted him a desolation The air smelled of harsh blossoms this was the desert and there was no rain A man stood before him a sorrowful light in his weary paindrenched eyes Mercer Rick said I am your friend the old man said But you must go on as if I did not exist Can you understand that He spread empty hands No Rick said I cant understand that I need help How can I save you the old man said if I cant save myself He smiled Dont you see There is no salvation  Then whats this for Rick demanded What are you for To show you Wilbur Mercer said that you arent alone I am here with you and always will be Go and do your task even though you know its wrong Why Rick said Why should I do it Ill quit my job and emigrate The old man said You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go It is the basic condition of life to be required to violate your own identity At some time every creature which lives must do so It is the ultimate shadow the defeat of creation this is the curse at work the curse that feeds on all life Everywhere in the universe Thats all you can tell me Rick said A rock whizzed at him he ducked and the rock struck him on the ear At once he let go of the handles and again he stood in his own living room beside his wife and the empathy box His head ached wildly from the blow reaching he found fresh blood collecting spilling in huge bright drops down the side of his face Iran with a handkerchief patted his ear I guess Im glad you pried me loose I really cant stand it being hit Thanks for taking the rock in my place Im going Rick said The job Three jobs He took the handkerchief from her and went to the hall door still dizzy and now feeling nausea Good luck Iran said I didnt get anything from holding onto those handles Rick said Mercer talked to me but it didnt help He doesnt know any more than I do Hes just an old man climbing a hill to his death Isnt that the revelation Rick said I have that revelation already He opened the hall door Ill see you later Stepping out into the hall he shut the door after him Conapt 3967C he reflected reading it off the back of the contract Thats out in the suburbs its mostly abandoned there A good place to hide Except  or the lights at night Thats what Ill be going by he thought The lights Phototropic like the deaths head moth And then after this he thought there wont be any more Ill do something else earn my living another way These three are the last Mercer is right I have to get this over with But he thought I dont think I can Two andys togetherthis isnt a moral question its a practical question I probably cant retire them he realized Even if I try Im too tired and too much has happened today Maybe Mercer knew this he reflected Maybe he foresaw everything that will happen But I know where I can get help offered to me before but declined He reached the roof and a moment later sat in the darkness of his hovercar dialing Rosen Association the answeringservice girl said Rachael Rosen he said Pardon sir Rick grated Get me Rachael Rosen Is Miss Rosen expecting Im sure she is he said He waited Ten minutes later Rachael Rosens small dark face appeared on the vidscreen Hello Mr Deckard Are you busy right now or can I talk to you he said As you said earlier today It did not seem like today a generation had risen and declined since he had talked to her last And all the weight all the weariness of it had recapitulated itself in his body he felt the physical burden Perhaps he thought because of the rock With the handkerchief he dabbed at his stillbleeding ear Your ear is cut Rachael said What a shame Rick said Did you really think I wouldnt call you As you said I told you Rachael said that without me one of the Nexus6s would get you before you got it You were wrong But you are calling Anyhow Do you want me to come down there to San Francisco Tonight he said Oh its too late Ill come tomorrow its an hour trip I have been told I have to get them tonight He paused and then said Out of the original eight three are left You sound like youve had a just awful time If you dont fly down here tonight he said Ill go after them alone and I wont be able to retire them I just bought a goat he added With the bounty money from the three I did get You humans Rachael laughed Goats smell terrible Only male goats I read it in the book of instructions that came with it You really are tired Rachael said You look dazed Are you sure you know what youre doing trying for three more Nexus6s the same day No one has ever retired six androids in one day Franklin Powers Rick said About a year ago in Chicago He retired seven The obsolete McMillan Y4 variety Rachael said This is something else She pondered Rick I cant do it I havent even had dinner I need you he said Otherwise Im going to die he said to himself I know it Mercer knew it I think you know it too And Im wasting my time appealing to you he reflected An android cant be appealed to theres nothing in there to reach Rachael said Im sorry Rick but I cant do it tonight Itll have to be tomorrow Android vengeance Rick said What Because I tripped you up on the VoigtKampff scale Do you think that Wideeyed she said Really  Goodby he said and started to hang up Listen Rachael said rapidly Youre not using your head It seems that way to you because you Nexus6 types are cleverer than humans No I really dont understand Rachael sighed I can tell that you dont want to do this job tonightmaybe not at all Are you sure you want me to make it possible for you to retire the three remaining androids Or do you want me to persuade you not to try Come down here he said and well rent a hotel room Why  Something I heard today he said hoarsely About situations involving human men and android women Come down here to San Francisco tonight and Ill give up on the remaining andys Well do something else She eyed him then abruptly said Okay Ill fly down Where should I meet you At the St Francis Its the only halfway decent hotel still in operation in the Bay Area And you wont do anything until I get there Ill sit in the hotel room he said and watch Buster Friendly on TV His guest for the last three days has been Amanda Werner I like her I could watch her the rest of my life She has breasts that smile He hung up then and sat for a time his mind vacant At last the cold of the car roused him he switched on the ignition key and a moment later headed in the direction of downtown San Francisco And the St Francis Hotel CHAPTER 16 In the sumptuous and enormous hotel room Rick Deckard sat reading the typed carbon sheets on the two androids Roy and Irmgard Baty In these two cases telescopic snapshots had been included fuzzy 3D color prints which he could barely make out The woman he decided looks attractive Roy Baty however is something different Something worse A pharmacist on Mars he read Or at least the android had made use of that cover In actuality it had probably been a manual laborer a field hand with aspirations for something better Do androids dream Rick asked himself Evidently thats why they occasionally kill their employers and flee here A better life without servitude Like Luba Luft singing Don Giovanni and Le Nozze instead of toiling across the face of a barren rockstrewn field On a fundamentally uninhabitable colony world Roy Baty the poop sheet informed him has an aggressive assertive air of ersatz authority Given to mystical preoccupations this android proposed the group escape attempt underwriting it ideologically with a pretentious fiction as to the sacredness of socalled android life In addition this android stole and experimented with various mindfusing drugs claiming when caught that it hoped to promote in androids a group experience similar to that of Mercerism which it pointed out remains unavailable to androids The account had a pathetic quality A rough cold android hoping to undergo an experience from which due to a deliberately builtin defect it remained excluded But he could not work up much concern for Roy Baty he caught from Daves jottings a repellent quality hanging about this particular android Baty had tried to force the fusion experience into existence for itselfand then when that fell through it had engineered the killing of a variety of human beings  followed by the flight to Earth And now especially as of today the chipping away of the original eight androids until only the three remained And they the outstanding members of the illegal group were also doomed since if he failed to get them someone else would Time and tide he thought The cycle of life Ending in this the last twilight Before the silence of death He perceived in this a microuniverse complete The door of the hotel room banged open What a flight Rachael Rosen said breathlessly entering in a long fishscale coat with matching bra and shorts she carried besides her big ornate mailpouch purse a paper bag This is a nice room She examined her wristwatch Less than an hourI made good time Here She held out the paper bag I bought a bottle Bourbon Rick said The worst of the eight is still alive The one who organized them He held the poop sheet on Roy Baty toward her Rachael set down the paper bag and accepted the carbon sheet Youve located this one she asked after reading I have a conapt number Out in the suburbs where possibly a couple of deteriorated specials antheads and chickenheads hang out and go through their versions of living Rachael held out her hand Lets see about the others Both females He passed her the sheets one dealing with Irmgard Baty the other an android calling itself Pris Stratton Glancing at the final sheet Rachael said Oh She tossed the sheets down moved over to the window of the room to look out at downtown San Francisco I think youre going to get thrown by the last one Maybe not maybe you dont care She had turned pale and her voice shook All at once she had become exceptionally unsteady Exactly what are you muttering about He retrieved the sheets studied them wondering which part had upset Rachael Lets open the bourbon Rachael carried the paper bag into the bathroom got two glasses returned she still seemed distracted and uncertainand preoccupied He sensed the rapid flight of her hidden thoughts the transitions showed on her frowning tense face Can you get this open she asked Its worth a fortune you realize Its not synthetic its from before the war made from genuine mash Taking the bottle he opened it poured bourbon in the two tumblers Tell me whats the matter he said Rachael said On the phone you told me if I flew down here tonight youd give up on the remaining three andys Well do something else you said But here we are Tell me what upset you he said Facing him defiantly Rachael said Tell me what were going to do instead of fussing and fretting around about those last three Nexus6 andys She unbuttoned her coat carried it to the closet and hung it up This gave him his first chance to have a good long look at her  Rachaels proportions he noticed once again were odd with her heavy mass of dark hair her head seemed large and because of her diminutive breasts her body assumed a lank almost childlike stance But her great eyes with their elaborate lashes could only be those of a grown woman there the resemblance to adolescence ended Rachael rested very slightly on the forepart of her feet and her arms as they hung bent at the joint The stance he reflected of a wary hunter of perhaps the CroMagnon persuasion The race of tall hunters he said to himself No excess flesh a flat belly small behind and smaller bosomRachael had been modeled on the Celtic type of build anachronistic and attractive Below the brief shorts her legs slender had a neutral nonsexual quality not much rounded off in nubile curves The total impression was good however Although definitely that of a girl not a woman Except for the restless shrewd eyes He sipped the bourbon the power of it the authoritative strong taste and scent had become almost unfamiliar to him and he had trouble swallowing Rachael in contrast had no difficulty with hers Seating herself on the bed Rachael smoothed absently at the spread her expression had now become one of moodiness He set his glass down on the bedside table and arranged himself beside her Under his gross weight the bed gave and Rachael shifted her position What is it he said Reaching he took hold of her hand it felt cold bony slightly moist What upset you That last goddamn Nexus6 type Rachael said enunciating with effort is the same type as I am She stared down at the bedspread found a thread and began rolling it into a pellet Didnt you notice the description Its of me too She may wear her hair differently and dress differentlyshe may even have bought a wig But when you see her youll know what I mean She laughed sardonically Its a good thing the association admitted Im an andy otherwise youd probably have gone mad when you caught sight of Pris Stratton Or thought she was me Why does that bother you so much Hell Ill be along when you retire her Maybe not Maybe I wont find her Rachael said I know Nexus6 psychology Thats why Im here thats why I can help you Theyre all holed up together the three of them Clustered around the deranged one calling himself Roy Baty Hell be masterminding their crucial allout final defense Her lips twisted Jesus she said Cheer up he said he cupped her sharp small chin in the palm of his hand lifted her head so that she had to face him I wonder what its like to kiss an android he said to himself Leaning forward an inch he kissed her dry lips No reaction followed Rachael remained impassive As if unaffected And yet he sensed otherwise Or perhaps it was wishful thinking I wish Rachael said that I had known that before I came I never would have flown down here I think youre asking too much You know what I have Toward this Pris android  Empathy he said Something like that Identification there goes I My god maybe thats whatll happen In the confusion youll retire me not her And she can go back to Seattle and live my life I never felt this way before We are machines stamped out like bottle caps Its an illusion that IIpersonaryreally exist Im just representative of a type She shuddered He could not help being amused Rachael had become so mawkishly morose Ants dont feel like that he said and theyre physically identical Ants They dont feel period Identical human twins They dont But they identify with each other I understand they have an empathic special bond Rising she got to the bourbon bottle a little unsteadily she refilled her glass and again drank swiftly For a time she slouched about the room brows knitted darkly and then as if sliding his way by chance she settled back onto the bed she swung her legs up and stretched out leaning against the fat pillows And sighed Forget the three andys Her voice filled with weariness Im so worn out from the trip I guess And from all I learned today I just want to sleep She shut her eyes If I die she murmured maybe Ill be born again when the Rosen Association stamps out its next unit of my subtype She opened her eyes and glared at him ferociously Do you know she said why I really came here Why Eldon and the other Rosensthe human oneswanted me to go along with you To observe he said To detail exactly what the Nexus does that gives it away on the VoigtKampff test On the test or otherwise Everything that gives it a different quality And then I report back and the association makes modifications of its zygotebath DNS factors And we then have the Nexus7 And when that gets caught we modify it again and eventually the association has a type that cant be distinguished Do you know of the Boneli ReflexArc Test he asked Were working on the spinal ganglia too Someday the Boneli test will fade into yesterdays hoary shroud of spiritual oblivion She smiled innocuouslyat variance with her words At this point he could not discern her degree of seriousness A topic of worldshaking importance yet dealt with facetiously an android trait possibly he thought No emotional awareness no feelingsense of the actual meaning of what she said Only the hollow formal intellectual definitions of the separate terms And more Rachael had begun to tease him Imperceptibly she had passed from lamenting her condition to taunting him about his Damn you he said Rachael laughed Im drunk I cant go with you If leave here She gestured in dismissal Ill stay behind and steep and you can tell me later what happened Except he said there wont be a later because Roy Baty will nail me But I cant help you anyhow now because Im drunk Anyhow you know the truth the brickhard irregular slithery surface of truth Im just an observer and I wont intervene to save you I dont care if Roy Baty nails you or not I care whether I get nailed She opened her eyes round and wide Christ Im empathic about myself And see if I go to that suburban brokendown conapt building She reached out toyed with a button of his shirt in slow facile twists she began unbuttoning it I dont dare go because androids have no loyalty to one another and I know that that goddamn Pris Stratton will destroy me and occupy my place See Take off your coat Why So we can go to bed Rachael said I bought a black Nubian goat he said I have to retire the three more andys I have to finish up my job and go home to my wife He got up walked around the bed to the bottle of bourbon Standing there he carefully poured himself a second drink his hands he observed shook only very slightly Probably from fatigue Both of us he realized are tired Too tired to hunt down three andys with the worst of the eight calling the shots Standing there he realized all at once that he had acquired an overt incontestable fear directed toward the principal android It all hung on Batyhad hung on it from the start Up to now he had encountered and retired progressively more ominous manifestations of Baty Now came Baty itself Thinking that he felt the fear grow it snared him completely now that he had let it approach his conscious mind I cant go without you now he said to Rachael I cant even leave here Polokov came after me Garland virtually came after me You think Roy Baty will look you up Setting down her empty glass she bent forward reached back and unfastened her bra With agility she slid it from her then stood swaying and grinning because she swayed In my purse she said I have a mechanism which our autofac on Mars builds as an emer She grimaced An emergency safety thingamajing jig while theyre putting a newly made andy through its routine inspection checks Get it out It resembles an oyster Youll see it He began hunting through the purse Like a human woman Rachael had every class of object conceivable filched and hidden away in her purse he found himself rooting interminably Meanwhile Rachael kicked off her boots and unzipped her shorts balancing on one foot she caught the discarded fabric with her toe and tossed it across the room She then dropped onto the bed roiled over to fumble for her glass accidently pushed the glass to the carpeted floor Damn she said and once again got shakily to her feet in her underpants she stood watching him at work on her purse and then with careful deliberation and attention she drew the bedcovers back got in drew the covers over her Is this it He held up a metallic sphere with a buttonstem projecting That cancels an android into catalepsy Rachael said her eyes shut For a few seconds Suspends its respiration yours too but humans can function without respiringperspiringfor a couple of minutes but the vagus nerve of an andy I know He straightened up The android autonomic nervous system isnt as flexible at cutting in and out as ours But as you say this wouldnt work for more than five or six seconds Long enough Rachael murmured to save your life So see She roused herself sat up in the bed If Roy Baty shows up here you can be holding that in your hand and you can press the stem on that thing And while Roy Baty is frozen stiff with no air supply to his blood and his brain cells deteriorating you can kill Roy Baty with your laser You have a laser tube he said In your purse A fake Androidsshe yawned eyes again shutarent permitted to carry lasers He walked over to the bed Squirming about Rachael managed to roll over at last onto her stomach face buried in the white lower sheet This is a clean noble virgin type of bed she stated Only clean noble girls who She pondered Androids cant bear children she said then Is that a loss He finished undressing her Exposed her pale cold loins Is it a loss Rachael repeated I dont really know I have no way to tell How does it feel to have a child How does it feel to be born for that matter Were not born we dont grow up instead of dying from illness or old age we wear out like ants Ants again thats what we are Not you I mean me Chitinous reflexmachines who arent really alive She twisted her head to one side said loudly Im not alive Youre not going to bed with a woman Dont be disappointed okay Have you ever made love to an android before No he said taking off his shirt and tie I understandthey tell meits convincing if you dont think too much about it But if you think too much if you reflect on what youre doingthen you cant go on For ahem physiological reasons Bending he kissed her bare shoulder Thanks Rick she said wanly Remember though dont think about it just do it Dont pause and be philosophical because from a philosophical standpoint its dreary For us both He said Afterward I still intend to look for Roy Baty I still need you to be there I know that laser tube you have in your purse is You think Ill retire one of your andys for you I think in spite of what you said youll help me all you can Otherwise you wouldnt be lying there in that bed I love you Rachael said If I entered a room and found a sofa covered with your hide Id score very high on the VoigtKampff test Tonight sometime he thought as he clicked off the bedside light I will retire a Nexus6 which looks exactly like this naked girl My good god he thought Ive wound up where Phil Resch said Go to bed with her first he remembered Then kill her I cant do it he said and backed away from the bed I wish you could Rachael said Her voice wavered Not because of you Because of Pris Stratton what I have to do to her Were not the same I dont can about Pris Stratton Listen Rachael thrashed about in the bed sitting up in the gloom he could dimly make out her almost breastless trim shape Go to bed with me and Ill retire Stratton  Okay Because I cant stand getting this close and then Thank you he said gratitudeundoubtedly because of the bourbonrose up inside him constricting his throat Two he thought I now have only two to retire just the Batys Would Rachael really do it Evidently Androids thought and functioned that way Yet he had never come across anything quite like this Goddamn it get into bed Rachael said He got into bed CHAPTER 17 Afterward they enjoyed a great luxury Rick had room service bring up coffee He sat for a long time within the arms of a green black and gold leaf lounge chair sipping coffee and meditating about the next few hours Rachael in the bathroom squeaked and hummed and splashed in the midst of a hot shower You made a good deal when you made that deal she called when she had shut off the water dripping her hair tied up with a rubber band she appeared bare and pink at the bathroom door We androids cant control our physical sensual passions You probably knew that in my opinion you took advantage of me She did not however appear genuinely angry If anything she had become cheerful and certainly as human as any girl he had known Do we really have to go track down those three andys tonight Yes he said Two for me to retire he thought one for you As Rachael put it the deal had been made Gathering a giant white bath towel about her Rachael said Did you enjoy that Yes Would you ever go to bed with an android again If it was a girl If she resembled you Rachael said Do you know what the lifespan of a humanoid robot such as myself is Ive been in existence two years How long do you calculate I have After a hesitation he said About two more years They never could solve that problem I mean cell replacement Perpetual or anyhow semiperpetual renewal Well so it goes Vigorously she began drying herself Her face had become expressionless Im sorry Rick said Hell Rachael said Im sorry I mentioned it Anyhow it keeps humans from running off and living with an android And this is true with you Nexus6 types too Its the metabolism Not the brain unit She trotted out swept up her underpants and began to dress He too dressed Then together saying little the two of them journeyed to the roof field where his hovercar had been parked by the pleasant whiteclad human attendant As they headed toward the suburbs of San Francisco Rachael said Its a nice night My goat is probably asleep by now he said Or maybe goats are nocturnal Some animals never sleep Sheep never do not that I could detect whenever you look at them theyre looking back Expecting to be fed What sort of wife do you have He did not answer Do you If you werent an android Rick interrupted if I could legally marry you I would Rachael said Or we could live in sin except that Im not alive Legally youre not But really you are Biologically Youre not made out of transistorized circuits like a false animal youre an organic entity And in two years he thought youll wear out and die Because we never solved the problem of cell replacement as you pointed out So I guess it doesnt matter anyhow This is my end he said to himself As a bounty hunter After the Batys there wont be any more Not after this tonight You look so sad Rachael said Putting his hand out he touched her cheek Youre not going to be able to hunt androids any longer she said calmly So dont look sad Please He stared at her No bounty bunter ever has gone on Rachael said After being with me Except one A very cynical man Phil Resch And hes nutty he works out in left field on his own I see Rick said He felt numb Completely Throughout his entire body But this trip were taking Rachael said wont be wasted because youre going to meet a wonderful spiritual man Roy Baty he said Do you know all of them I knew all of them when they still existed I know three now We tried to stop you this morning before you started out with Dave Holdens list I tried again just before Polokov reached you But then after that I had to wait Until I broke down he said And had to call you Luba Luft and I had been close very close friends for almost two years What did you think of her Did you like her I liked her But you killed her Phil Resch killed her Oh so Phil accompanied you back to the opera house We didnt know that our communications broke down about then We knew just that she had been killed we naturally assumed by you From Daves notes he said I think I can still go ahead and retire Roy Baty But maybe not Irmgard Baty And not Pris Stratton he thought Even now even knowing this So all that took place at the hotel he said consisted of a The association Rachael said wanted to reach the bounty hunters here and in the Soviet Union This seemed to work  for reasons which we do not fully understand Our limitation again I guess I doubt if it works as often or as well as you say he said thickly But it has with you Well see I already know Rachael said When I saw that expression on your face that grief I look for that How many times have you done this I dont remember Seven eight No I believe its nine Sheor rather itnodded Yes nine times The idea is oldfashioned Rick said Startled Rachael said Wwhat Pushing the steering wheel away from him he put the car into a gliding decline Or anyhow thats how it strikes me Im going to kill you he said And go on to Roy and Irmgard Baty and Pris Stratton alone Thats why youre landing Apprehensively she said Theres a fine Im the property the legal property of the association Im not an escaped android who fled here from Mars Im not in the same class as the others But he said if I can kill you then I can kill them Her hands dived for her bulging overstuffed kipplefilled purse she searched frantically then gave up Goddamn this purse she said with ferocity I never can lay my hands on anything in it Will you kill me in a way that wont hurt I mean do it carefully If I dont fight okay I promise not to fight Do you agree Rick said I understand now why Phil Resch said what he said He wasnt being cynical he had just learned too much Going through thisI cant blame him It warped him But the wrong way She seemed more externally composed now But still fundamentally frantic and tense Yet the dark fire waned the life force oozed out of her as he had so often witnessed before with other androids The classic resignation Mechanical intellectual acceptance of that which a genuine organismwith two billion years of the pressure to live and evolve hagriding itcould never have reconciled itself to I cant stand the way you androids give up he said savagely The car now swooped almost to the ground he had to jerk the wheel toward him to avoid a crash Braking he managed to bring the car to a staggering careening halt he slammed off the motor and got out his laser tube At the occipital bone the posterior base of my skull Rachael said Please She twisted about so that she did not have to look at the laser tube the beam would enter unperceived Putting his laser tube away Rick said I cant do what Phil Resch said He snapped the motor back on and a moment later they had taken off again If youre ever going to do it Rachael said do it now Dont make me wait Im not going to kill you He steered the car in the direction of downtown San Francisco once again Your cars at the St Francis isnt it Ill let you off there and you can head for Seattle That ended what he had to say he drove in silence Thanks for not killing me Rachael said presently Hell as you said youve only got two years of life left anyhow And Ive got fifty Ill live twentyfive times as long as you But you really look down on me Rachael said For what I did Assurance had returned to her the litany of her voice picked up pace Youve gone the way of the others The bounty hunters before you Each time they get furious and talk wildly about killing me but when the time comes they cant do it Just like you just now She lit a cigarette inhaled with relish You realize what this means dont you It means I was right you wont be able to retire any more androids it wont be just me itll be the Batys and Stratton too So go on home to your goat And get some rest Suddenly she brushed at her coat violently Yife I got a burning ash from my cigarettethere its gone She sank back against the seat relaxing He said nothing That goat Rachel said You love the goat more than you love your wife probably First the goat then your wife then last of all She laughed merrily What can you do but laugh He did not answer They continued in silence for a while and then Rachael poked about found the cars radio and switched it on Turn it off Rick said Turn off Buster Friendly and his Friendly Friends Tum off Amanda Werner and Oscar Scruggs Its time to hear Busters big sensational exposé which is finally almost arrived She stooped to read the dial of her watch by the radios light Very soon now Did you already know about it Hes been talking about it building up to it for The radio said ah jes wan ta tell ya folks that ahm sitten hih with my pal Bustuh an were tawkin en haven a real mighty fine time waitin expectantly as we ah with each tick uh the clock foh what ah understan is the mos important announcement of Rick shut the radio off Oscar Scruggs he said The voice of intelligent man Instantly reaching Rachael clicked the radio back on I want to listen I intend to listen This is important what Buster Friendly has to say on his show tonight The idiotic voice babbled once more from the speaker and Rachael Rosen settled back and made herself comfortable Beside him in the darkness the coal of her cigarette glowed like the rump of a complacent lightning bug a steady unwavering index of Rachael Rosens achievement Her victory over him CHAPTER 18 Bring the rest of my property up here Pris ordered J R Isidore In particular I want the TV set So we can hear Busters announcement Yes Irmgard Baty agreed brighteyed like a darting plumed swift We need the TV weve been waiting a long time for tonight and now itll be starting soon Isidore said My own set gets the government channel Off in a corner of the living room seated in a deep chair as if he intended to remain permanently as if he had taken up lodgings in the chair Roy Baty belched and said patiently Its Buster Friendly and his Friendly Friends that we want to watch Iz Or do you want me to call you JR Anyhow do you understand So will you go get the set Alone Isidore made his way down the echoing empty hall to the stairs The potent strong fragrance of happiness still bloomed in him the sense of beingfor the first time in his dull lifeuseful Others depend on me now he exulted as he trudged down the dustimpacted steps to the level beneath And he thought itll be nice to see Buster Friendly on TV again instead of just listening on the radio in the store truck And thats right he realized Buster Friendly is going to reveal his carefully documented sensational exposé tonight So because of Pris and Roy and Irmgard I get to watch what will probably be the most important piece of news to be released in many years How about that he said to himself Life for J R Isidore had definitely taken an upswing He entered Priss former apartment unplugged the TV set and detached the antenna The silence all at once penetrated he felt his arms grow vague In the absence of the Batys and Pris he found himself fading out becoming strangely like the inert television set which he had just unplugged You have to be with other people he thought In order to live at all I mean before they came here I could stand it being alone in the building But now its changed You cant go back he thought You cant go from people to nonpeople In panic he thought Im dependent on them Thank god they stayed It would require two trips to transfer Priss possessions to the apartment above Hoisting the TV set he decided to take it first then the suitcases and remaining clothes A few minutes later he had gotten the TV set upstairs his fingers groaning he placed it on a coffee table in his living room The Batys and Pris watched impassively We get a good signal in this building he panted as he plugged in the cord and attached the antenna When I used to get Buster Friendly and his Just turn the set on Roy Baty said And stop talking He did so then hurried to the door One more trip he said will do it He lingered warming himself at the hearth of their presence Fine Pris said remotely Isidore started off once more I think he thought theyre exploiting me sort of But he did not care Theyre still good friends to have he said to himself Downstairs again he gathered the girls clothing together stuffed every piece into the suitcases then labored back down the hall once again and up the stairs On a step ahead of him something small moved in the dust Instantly he dropped the suitcases he whipped out a plastic medicine bottle which like everyone else he carried for just this A spider undistinguished but alive Shakily he eased it into the bottle and snapped the capperforated by means of a needleshut tight Upstairs at the door of his apartment he paused to get his breath yes sir folks the time is now  This is Buster Friendly who hopes and trusts youre as eager as I am to share the discovery which Ive made and by the way had verified by top trained research workers working extra hours over the past weeks Ho ho folks this is it  John Isidore said I found a spider The three androids glanced up momentarily moving their attention from the TV screen to him Lets see it Pris said She held out her hand Roy Baty said Dont talk while Buster is on Ive never seen a spider Pris said She cupped the medicine bottle in her palms surveying the creature within All those legs Whys it need so many legs JR Thats the way spiders are Isidore said his heart pounding he had difficulty breathing Eight legs Rising to her feet Pris said You know what I think JR I think it doesnt need all those legs Eight Irmgard Baty said Why couldnt it get by on four Cut four off and see Impulsively opening her purse she produced a pair of clean sharp cuticle scissors which she passed to Pris A weird terror struck at J R Isidore Carrying the medicine bottle into the kitchen Pris seated herself at J R Isidores breakfast table She removed the lid from the bottle and dumped the spider out It probably wont be able to run as fast she said but theres nothing for it to catch around here anyhow Itll die anyway She reached for the scissors Please Isidore said Pris glanced up inquiringly Is it worth something  Dont mutilate it he said wheezingly Imploringly With the scissors Pris snipped off one of the spiders legs In the living room Buster Friendly on the TV screen said Take a look at this enlargement of a section of background This is the sky you usually see Wait Ill have Earl Parameter head of my research staff explain their virtually worldshaking discovery to you Pris clipped off another leg restraining the spider with the edge of her hand She was smiling Blowups of the video pictures a new voice from the TV said when subjected to rigorous laboratory scrutiny reveal that the gray backdrop of sky and daytime moon against which Mercer moves is not only not Terranit is artificial  Youre missing it Irmgard called anxiously to Pris she rushed to the kitchen door saw what Pris had begun doing Oh do that afterward she said coaxingly This is so important what theyre saying it proves that everything we believed Be quiet Roy Baty said is true Irmgard finished The TV set continued The moon is painted in the enlargements one of which you see now on your screen brushstrokes show And there is even some evidence that the scraggly weeds and dismal sterile soilperhaps even the stones hurled at Mercer by unseen alleged partiesare equally faked It is quite possible in fact that the stones are made of soft plastic causing no authentic wounds In other words Buster Friendly broke in Wilbur Mercer is not suffering at all The research chief said Weve at last managed Mr Friendly to track down a former Hollywood specialeffects man a Mr Wade Cortot who flatly states from his years of experience that the figure of Mercer could well be merely some bit player marching across a sound stage Cortot has gone so far as to declare that he recognizes the stage as one used by a now outofbusiness minor moviemaker with whom Cortot had various dealings several decades ago So according to Cortot Buster Friendly said there can be virtually no doubt Pris had now cut three legs from the spider which crept about miserably on the kitchen table seeking a way out a path to freedom It found none Quite frankly we believed Cortot the research chief said in his dry pedantic voice and we spent a good deal of time examining publicity pictures of bit players once employed by the now defunct Hollywood movie industry And you found Listen to this Roy Baty said Irmgard gazed fixedly at the TV screen and Pris had ceased her mutilation of the spider We located by means of thousands upon thousands of photographs a very old man now named Al Jarry who played a number of bit parts in prewar films From our lab we sent a team to Jarrys home in East Harmony Indiana Ill let one of the members of that team describe what he found Silence then a new voice equally pedestrian The house on Lark Avenue in East Harmony is tottering and shabby and at the edge of town where no one except Al Jarry still lives Invited amiably in and seated in the stalesmelling moldering kipplefilled living room I scanned by telepathic means the blurred debriscluttered and hazy mind of Al Jarry seated across from me Listen Roy Baty said on the edge of his seat poised as if to pounce I found the technician continued that the old man did in actuality make a series of short fifteen minute video films for an employer whom he never met And as we had theorized the rocks did consist of rubberlike plastic The blood shed was catsup and the technician chuckledthe only suffering Mr Jarry underwent was having to go an entire day without a shot of whisky Al Jarry Buster Friendly said his face returning to the screen Well well An old man who even in his prime never amounted to anything which either he or ourselves could respect Al Jarry made a repetitious and dull film a series of them in fact for whom he knew notand does not to this day It has often been said by adherents of the experience of Mercerism that Wilbur Mercer is not a human being that he is in fact an archetypal superior entity perhaps from another star Well in a sense this contention has proven correct Wilbur Mercer is not human does not in fact exist The world in which he climbs is a cheap Hollywood commonplace sound stage which vanished into kipple years ago And who then has spawned this hoax on the Sol System Think about that for a time folks We may never know Irmgard murmured Buster Friendly said We may never know Nor can we fathom the peculiar purpose behind this swindle Yes folks swindle Mercerism is a swindle  I think we know Roy Baty said Its obvious Mercerism came into existence But ponder this Buster Friendly continued Ask yourselves what is it that Mercerism does Well if were to be1ieve its many practitioners the experience fuses Its that empathy that humans have Irmgard said men and women throughout the Sol System into a single entity But an entity which is manageable by the so called telepathic voice of Mercer Mark that An ambitious politically minded wouldbe Hitler could No its that empathy Irmgard said vigorously Fists clenched she roved into the kitchen up to Isidore Isnt it a way of proving that humans can do something we cant do Because without the Mercer experience we just have your word that you feel this empathy business this shared group thing Hows the spider She bent over Priss shoulder With the scissors Pris snipped off another of the spiders legs Four now she said She nudged the spider He wont go But he can Roy Baty appeared at the doorway inhaling deeply an expression of accomplishment on his face Its done Buster said it out loud and nearly every human in the system heard him say it Mercerism is a swindle The whole experience of empathy is a swindle He came over to look curiously at the spider It wont try to walk Irmgard said I can make it walk Roy Baty got out a book of matches lit a match he held it near the spider closer and closer until at last it crept feebly away I was right Irmgard said Didnt I say it could walk with only four legs She peered up expectantly at Isidore Whats the matter Touching his arm she said You didnt lose anything well pay you what thatwhats it calledthat Sidneys catalogue says Dont look so grim Isnt that something about Mercer what they discovered All that research Hey answer She prodded him anxiously Hes upset Pris said Because he has an empathy box In the other room Do you use it JR she asked Isidore Roy Baty said Of course he uses it Theyall door did Maybe now theyll start wondering I dont think this will end the cult of Mercer Pris said But right this minute therere a lot of unhappy human beings To Isidore she said Weve waited for months we all knew it was coming this pitch of Busters She hesitated and then said Well why not Buster is one of us An android Irmgard explained And nobody knows No humans I mean Pris with the scissors cut yet another leg from the spider All at once John Isidore pushed her away and lifted up the mutilated creature He carried it to the sink and there he drowned it In him his mind his hopes drowned too As swiftly as the spider Hes really upset Irmgard said nervously Dont look like that JR And why dont you say anything To Pris and to her husband she said It makes me terribly upset him Just standing there by the sink and not speaking he hasnt said anything since we turned on the TV Its not the TV Pris said Its the spider Isnt it John R Isidore Hell get over it she said to Irmgard who had gone into the other room to shut off the TV Regarding Isidore with easy amusement Roy Baty said Its all over now Iz For Mercerism I mean With his nails he managed to lift the corpse of the spider from the sink Maybe this was the last spider he said The last living spider on Earth He reflected In that case its all over for spiders too Idont feel well Isidore said From the kitchen cupboard he got a cup he stood holding it for an intervalhe did not know exactly how long And then he said to Roy Baty Is the sky behindMercer just painted Not real You saw the enlargements on the TV screen Roy Baty said The brushstrokes Mercerism isnt finished Isidore said Something ailed the three androids something terrible The spider he thought Maybe it had been the last spider on Earth as Roy Baty said And the spider is gone Mercer is gone he saw the dust and the ruin of the apartment as it lay spreading out everywherehe heard the kipple coming the final disorder of all forms the absence which would win out It grew around him as he stood holding the empty ceramic cup the cupboards of the kitchen creaked and split and he felt the floor beneath his feet give Reaching out he touched the wall His hand broke the surface gray particles trickled and hurried down fragments of plaster resembling the radioactive dust outside He seated himself at the table and like rotten hollow tubes the legs of the chair bent standing quickly he set down the cup and tried to reform the chair tried to press it back into its right shape The chair came apart in his hands the screws which had previously connected its several sections ripping out and hanging loose He saw on the table the ceramic cup crack webs of fine lines grew like the shadows of a vine and then a chip dropped from the edge of the cup exposing the rough unglazed interior Whats he doing Irmgard Batys voice came to him distantly Hes breaking everything Isidore stop Im not doing it he said He walked unsteadily into the living room to be by himself he stood by the tattered couch and gazed at the yellow stained wall with all the spots which dead bugs that had once crawled had left and again he thought of the corpse of the spider with its four remaining legs Everything in here is old he realized It long ago began to decay and it wont stop The corpse of the spider has taken over In the depression caused by the sagging of the floor pieces of animals manifested themselves the head of a crow mummified hands which might have once been parts of monkeys A donkey stood a little way off not stirring and yet apparently alive at least it had not begun to deteriorate He started toward it feeling sticklike bones dry as weeds splinter under his shoes But before he could reach the donkeyone of the creatures which he loved the mosta shiny blue crow fell from above to perch on the donkeys unprotesting muzzle Dont he said aloud but the crow rapidly picked out the donkeys eyes Again he thought Its happening to me again I will be down here a long time he realized As before Its always long because nothing here ever changes a point comes when it does not even decay A dry wind rustled and around him the heaps of bones broke Even the wind destroys them he perceived At this stage just before time ceases I wish I could remember how to climb up from here he thought Looking up he saw nothing to grasp Mercer he said aloud Where are you now This is the tomb world and I am in it again but this time youre not here too Something crept across his foot He knelt down and searched for itand found it because it moved so slowly The mutilated spider advancing itself haltingly on its surviving legs he picked it up and held it in the palm of his hand The bones  he realized have reversed themselves  the spider is again alive Mercer must be near The wind blew cracking and splintering the remaining bones but he sensed the presence of Mercer Come here he said to Mercer Crawl across my foot or find some other way of reaching me Okay Mercer he thought Aloud he said Mercer Across the landscape weeds advanced weeds corkscrewed their way into the walls around him and worked the walls until they the weeds became their own spore The spore expanded split and burst within the corrupted steel and shards of concrete that had formerly been walls But the desolation remained after the walls had gone the desolation followed after everything else Except the frail dim figure of Mercer the old man faced him a placid expression on his face Is the sky painted Isidore asked Are there really brushstrokes that show up under magnification Yes Mercer said I cant see them Youre too close Mercer said You have to be a long way off the way the androids are They have better perspective Is that why they claim youre a fraud I am a fraud Mercer said Theyre sincere their research is sincere From their standpoint I am an elderly retired bit player named Al Jarry All of it their disclosure is true They interviewed me at my home as they claim I told them whatever they wanted to know which was everything Including about the whisky Mercer smiled It was true They did a good job and from their standpoint Buster Friendlys disclosure was convincing They will have trouble understanding why nothing has changed Because youre still here and Im still here Mercer indicated with a sweep of his hand the barren rising hillside the familiar place I lifted you from the tomb world just now and I will continue to lift you until you lose interest and want to quit But you will have to stop searching for me because I will never stop searching for you I didnt like that about the whisky Isidore said Thats lowering Thats because youre a highly moral person Im not I dont judge not even myself Mercer held out a closed hand palm up Before I forget it I have something of yours here He opened his fingers On his hand rested the mutilated spider but with its snippedoff legs restored Thanks Isidore accepted the spider He started to say something further An alarm bell clanged Roy Baty snarled Theres a bounty hunter in the building Get all the lights off Get him away from that empathy box he has to be ready at the door Go onmove him  CHAPTER 19 Looking down John Isidore saw his own hands they gripped the twin handles of the empathy box As he stood gaping at them the lights in the living room of his apartment plunged out He could see in the kitchen Pris hurrying to catch the table lamp there Listen JR Irmgard whispered harshly in his ear she had grabbed him by the shoulder her nails digging into him with frantic intensity She seemed unaware of what she did now in the dim nocturnal light from outdoors Irmgards face had become distorted astigmatic It had turned intoa craven dish with cowering tiny lidless eyes You have to go she whispered to the door when he knocks if he does knock you have to show him your identification and tell him this is your apartment and no one else is here And you ask to see a warrant Pris standing on the other side of him her body arched whispered Dont let him in JR Say anything do anything that will stop him Do you know what a bounty hunter would do let loose in here Do you understand what he would do to us  Moving away from the two android females Isidore groped his way to the door with his fingers he located the knob halted there listening He could sense the hall outside is he always had sensed it vacant and reverberating and lifeless Hear anything Roy Baty said bending close Isidore smelled the rank cringing body he inhaled fear from it fear pouring out forming a mist Step out and take a look Opening the door Isidore looked up and down the indistinct hall The air out here had a clear quality despite the weight of dust He still held the spider which Mercer had given him Was it actually the spider which Pris had snipped apart with Irmgard Batys cuticle scissors Probably not He would never know But anyhow it was alive it crept about within his closed hand not biting him as with most small spiders its mandibles could not puncture human skin He reached the end of the hall descended the stairs and stepped outside onto what had once been a terraced path gardenenclosed The garden had perished during the war and the path had ruptured in a thousand places But he knew its surface under his feet the familiar path felt good and he followed it passed along the greater side of the building coming at last to the only verdant spot in the vicinitya yardsquare patch of dustsaturated drooping weeds There he deposited the spider He experienced its wavering progress as it departed his hand Well that was that he straightened up A flashlight beam focused on the weeds in its glare their halfdead stalks appeared stark menacing Now he could see the spider it rested on a serrated leaf So it had gotten away all right What did you do the man holding the flashlight asked I put down a spider he said wondering why the man didnt see in the beam of yellow light the spider bloated up larger than life So it could get away Why dont you take it up to your apartment You ought to keep it in a jar According to the January Sidneys most spiders are up ten percent in retail price You could have gotten a hundred and some odd dollars for it Isidore said If I took it back up there shed cut it apart again Bit by bit to see what it did Androids do that the man said Reaching into his overcoat he brought out something which he flapped open and extended toward Isidore In the irregular light the bounty hunter seemed a medium man not impressive Round face and hairless smooth features like a clerk in a bureaucratic office Methodical but informal Not demigod in shape not at all as Isidore had anticipated him Im an investigator for the San Francisco Police Department Deckard Rick Deckard The man flapped his ID shut again stuck it back in his overcoat pocket Theyre up there now The three Well the thing is Isidore said Im looking after them Two are women Theyre the last ones of the group the rest are dead I brought Priss TV set up from her apartment and put it in mine so they could watch Buster Friendly Buster proved beyond a doubt that Mercer doesnt exist Isidore felt excitement knowing something of this importancenews that the bounty hunter evidently hadnt heard Lets go up there Deckard said Suddenly he held a laser tube pointed at Isidore then indecisively he put it away Youre a special arent you he said A chickenhead But I have a job I drive a truck for Horrified he discovered he had forgotten the name a pet hospital he said The Van Ness Pet Hospital he said Owned bbby Hannibal Sloat Deckard said Will you take me up there and show me which apartment theyre in Therere over a thousand separate apartments you can save me a lot of time His voice dipped with fatigue If you kill them you wont be able to fuse with Mercer again Isidore said You wont take me up there Show me which floor Just tell me the floor Ill figure out which apartment on the floor it is No Isidore said Under state and federal law Deckard began He ceased then Giving up the interrogation Good night he said and walked away up the path and into the building his flashlight bleeding a yellowed diffuse path before him Inside the conapt building Rick Deckard shut off his flashlight guided by the ineffectual recessed bulbs spaced ahead of him he made his way along the hall thinking The chickenhead knows theyre androids he knew it already before I told him But he doesnt understand On the other hand who does Do I Did I And one of them will be a duplicate of Rachael he reflected Maybe the special has been living with her I wonder how he liked it he asked himself Maybe that was the one who he believed would cut up his spider I could go back and get that spider he reflected Ive never found a live wild animal It must be a fantastic experience to look down and see something living scuttling along Maybe itll happen someday to me like it did him He had brought listening gear from his car he set it up now a revolving deteksnout with blip screen In the silence of the hall the screen indicated nothing Not on this floor he said to himself He clicked over to vertical On that axis the snout absorbed a faint signal Upstairs He gathered up the gear and his briefcase and climbed the stairs to the next floor A figure in the shadows waited If you move Ill retire you Rick said The male one waiting for him In his clenched fingers the laser tube felt hard but he could not lift it and aim it He had been caught first caught too soon Im not an android the figure said My name is Mercer It stepped into a zone of light I inhabit this building because of Mr Isidore The special who had the spider you talked briefly to him outside Am I outside Mercerism now Rick said As the chickenhead said Because of what Im going to do in the next few minutes Mercer said Mr Isidore spoke for himself not for me What you are doing has to be done I said that already Raising his arm he pointed at the stairs behind Rick I came to tell you that one of them is behind you and below not in the apartment It will be the hard one of the three and you must retire it first The rustling ancient voice gained abrupt fervor Quick Mr Deckard On the steps  His laser tube thrust out Rick spun and sank onto his haunches facing the flight of stairs Up it glided a woman toward him and he knew her he recognized her and lowered his laser tube Rachael he said perplexed Had she followed him in her own hovercar tracked him here And why Go back to Seattle he said Leave me alone Mercer told me Ive got to do it And then he saw that it was not quite Rachael For what weve meant to each other the android said as it approached him its arms reaching as if to clutch at him The clothes he thought are wrong But the eyes the same eyes And there are more like this there can be a legion of her each with its own name but all Rachael RosenRachael the prototype used by the manufacturer to protect the others He fired at her as imploringly she dashed toward him The android burst and parts of it flew he covered his face and then looked again looked and saw the laser tube which it had carried roll away back onto the stairs the metal tube bounced downward step by step the sound echoing and diminishing and slowing The hard one of the three Mercer had said He peered about searching for Mercer The old man had gone They can follow me with Rachael Rosens until I die he thought or until the type becomes obsolete whichever comes first And now the other two he thought One of them is not in the apartment Mercer had said Mercer protected me he realized Manifested himself and offered aid Sheitwould have gotten me he said to himself except for the fact that Mercer warned me I can do the rest now he realized This was the impossible one she knew I couldnt do this But its over In an instant I did what I couldnt do The Batys I can track by standard procedure they will be hard but they wont be like this He stood alone in the empty hall Mercer had left him because he had done what he came for Rachaelor rather Pris Strattonhad been dismembered and that left nothing now only himself But elsewhere in the building the Batys waited and knew Perceived what he had done here Probably at this point they were afraid This had been their response to his presence in the building Their attempt Without Mercer it would have worked For them winter had come This has to be done quickly what Im after now he realized he hurried down the hall and all at once his detection gear registered the presence of cephalic activity He had found their apartment No more need of the gear he discarded it and rapped on the apartment door From within a mans voice sounded Who is it This is Mr Isidore Rick said Let me in because Im looking after you and tttwo of you are women Were not opening the door a womans voice came I want to watch Buster Friendly on Priss TV set Rick said Now that hes proved Mercer doesnt exist its very important to watch him I drive a truck for the Van Ness Pet Hospital which is owned by Mr Hannibal Sssloat He made himself stammer Ssso would you open the dddoor Its my apartment He waited and the door opened Within the apartment he saw darkness and indistinct shapes two of them The smaller shape the woman said You have to administer tests Its too late Rick said The taller figure tried to push the door shut and turn on some variety of electronic equipment No Rick said I have to come in He let Roy Baty fire once he held his own fire until the laser beam had passed by him as he twisted out of the way Youve lost your legal basis Rick said by firing on me You should have forced me to give you the VoigtKampff test But now it doesnt matter Once more Roy Baty sent a laser beam cutting at him missed dropped the tube and ran somewhere deeper inside the apartment to another room perhaps the electronic hardware abandoned Why didnt Pris get you Mrs Baty said There is no Pris he said Only Rachael Rosen over and over again He saw the laser tube in her dimly outlined hand Roy Baty had slipped it to her had meant to decoy him into the apartment far in so that Irmgard Baty could get him from behind in the back Im sorry Mrs Baty Rick said and shot her Roy Baty in the other room let out a cry of anguish Okay you loved her Rick said And I loved Rachael And the special loved the other Rachael He shot Roy Baty the big mans corpse lashed about toppled like an overstacked collection of separate brittle entities it smashed into the kitchen table and carried dishes and flatware down with it Reflex circuits in the corpse made it twitch and flutter but it had died Rick ignored it not seeing it and not seeing that of Irmgard Baty by the front door I got the last one Rick realized Six today almost a record And now its over and I can go home back to Iran and the goat And well have enough money for once He sat down on the couch and presently as he sat there in the silence of the apartment among the nonstirring objects the special Mr Isidore appeared at the door Better not look Rick said I saw her on the stairs Pris The special was crying Dont take it so hard Rick said He got dizzily to his feet laboring Wheres your phone The special said nothing did nothing except stand So Rick hunted for the phone himself found it and dialed Harry Bryants office CHAPTER 20 Good Harrv Bryant said after he had been told Well go get some rest Well send a patrol car to pick up the three bodies Rick Deckard hung up Androids are stupid he said savagely to the special Roy Baty couldnt tell me from you it thought you were at the door The police will clean up in here why dont you stay in another apartment until theyre finished You dont want to be in here with whats left Im leaving this bbbuilding Isidore said Im going to lllive deeper in town where theres mmmore people I think theres a vacant apartment in my building Rick said Isidore stammered I dont wwwant to live near you Go outside or upstairs Rick said Dont stay in here The special floundered not knowing what to do a variety of mute expressions crossed his face and then turning he shuffled out of the apartment leaving Rick alone What a job to have to do Rick thought Im a scoure like famine or plague Where I go the ancient curse follows As Mercer said I am required to do wrong Everything Ive done has been wrong from the start Anyhow now its time to go home Maybe after Ive been there awhile with Iran Ill forget When he got back to his own apartment building Iran met him on the roof She looked at him in a deranged peculiar way in all his years with her he had never seen her like this Putting his arm around her he said Anyhow its over And Ive been thinking maybe Harry Bryant can assign me to a Rick she said I have to tell you something Im sorry The goat is dead For some reason it did not surprise him it only made him feel worse a quantitative addition to the weight shrinking him from every side I think theres a guarantee in the contract he said If it gets sick within ninety days the dealer It didnt get sick SomeoneIran cleared her throat and went on huskilysomeone came here got the goat out of its cage and dragged it to the edge of the roof And pushed it off he said Yes She nodded Did you see who did it I saw her very clearly Iran said Barbour was still up here fooling around he came down to get me and we called the police but by then the animal was dead and she had left A small younglooking girl with dark hair and large black eyes very thin Wearing a long fishscale coat She had a mailpouch purse And she made no effort to keep us from seeing her As if she didnt care No she didnt care he said Rachael wouldnt give a damn if you saw her she probably wanted you to so Id know who had done it He kissed her Youve been waiting up here all this time Only for half an hour Thats when it happened half an hour ago Iran gently kissed him back Its so awful So needless He turned toward his parked car opened the door and got in behind the wheel Not needless he said She had what seemed to her a reason An android reason he thought Where are you going Wont you come downstairs and be with me There was the most shocking news on TV Buster Friendly claims that Mercer is a fake What do you think about that Rick Do you think it could be true Everything is true he said Everything anybody has ever thought He snapped on the car motor Will you be all right Ill be all right he said and thought And Im going to die Both those are true too He closed the car door flicked a signal with his hand to Iran and then swept up into the night sky Once he thought I would have seen the stars Years ago But now its only the dust no one has seen a star in years at least not from Earth Maybe Ill go where I can see stars he said to himself as the car gained velocity and altitude it headed away from San Francisco toward the uninhabited desolation to the north To the place where no living thing would go Not unless it felt that the end had come CHAPTER 21 In the early morning light the land below him extended seemingly forever gray and refuselittered Pebbles the size of houses had rolled to a stop next to one another and he thought Its like a shipping room when all the merchandise has left Only fragments of crates remain the containers which signify nothing in themselves Once he thought crops grew here and animals grazed What a remarkable thought that anything could have cropped grass here What a strange place he thought for all of that to die He brought the hovercar down coasted above the surface for a time What would Dave Holden say about me now he asked himself In one sense Im now the greatest bounty hunter who ever lived no one ever retired six Nexus6 types in one twentyfourhour span and no one probably ever will again I ought to call him he said to himself A cluttered hillside swooped up at him he lifted the hovercar as the world came close Fatigue he thought I shouldnt be driving still He clicked off the ignition glided for an interval and then set the hovercar down It tumbled and bounced across the hillside scattering rocks headed upward it came at last to a grinding skittering stop Picking up the receiver of the cars phone he dialed the operator at San Francisco Give me Mount Zion Hospital he told her Presently he had another operator on the vidscreen Mount Zion Hospital You have a patient named Dave Holden he said Would it be possible to talk to him Is he well enough Just a moment and Ill check on that sir The screen temporarily blanked out Time passed Rick took a pinch of Dr Johnson Snuff and shivered without the cars heater the temperature had begun to plunge Dr Costa says that Mr Holden is not receiving calls the operator told him reappearing This is police business he said he held his flat pack of ID up to the screen Just a moment Again the operator vanished Again Rick inhaled a pinch of Dr Johnson Snuff the menthol in it tasted foul so early in the morning He rolled down the car window and tossed the little yellow tin out into the rubble No sir the operator said once more on his screen Dr Costa does not feel Mr Holdens condition will permit him to take any calls no matter how urgent for at least Okay Rick said He hung up The air too had a foul quality he rolled up the window again Dave is really out he reflected I wonder why they didnt get me Because I moved too fast he decided All in one day they couldnt have expected it Harry Bryant was right The car had become too cold now so he opened the door and stepped out A noxious unexpected wind filtered through his clothes and he began to walk rubbing his hands together It would have been rewarding to talk to Dave he decided Dave would have approved what I did But also he would have understood the other part which I dont think even Mercer comprehends For Mercer everything is easy he thought because Mercer accepts everything Nothing is alien to him But what Ive done he thought thats become alien to me In fact everything about me has become unnatural Ive become an unnatural self He walked on up the hillside and with each step the weight on him grew Too tired he thought to climb Stopping he wiped stinging sweat from his eyes salt tears produced by his skin his whole aching body Then angry at himself he spatspat with wrath and contempt for himself with utter hate onto the barren ground Thereupon he resumed his trudge up the slope the lonely and unfamiliar terrain remote from everything nothing lived here except himself The heat It had become hot now evidently time had passed And he felt hunger He had not eaten for god knew how long The hunger and heat combined a poisonous taste resembling defeat yes he thought thats what it is Ive been defeated in some obscure way By having killed the androids By Rachaels murder of my goat He did not know but as he plodded along a vague and almost hallucinatory pall hazed over his mind he found himself at one point with no notion of how it could be a step from an almost certainly fatal cliffside fallfalling humiliatingly and helplessly he thought on and on with no one even to witness it Here there existed no one to record his or anyone elses degradation and any courage or pride which might manifest itself here at the end would go unmarkedthe dead stones the duststricken weeds dry and dying perceived nothing recollected nothing about him or themselves At that moment the first rockand it was not rubber or soft foam plasticstruck him in the inguinal region And the pain the first knowledge of absolute isolation and suffering touched him throughout in its undisguised actual form He halted And then goaded onthe goad invisible but real not to be challengedhe resumed his climb Rolling upward he thought like the stones I am doing what stones do without volition Without it meaning anything Mercer he said panting he stopped stood still In front of him he distinguished a shadowy figure motionless Wilbur Mercer Is that you My god he realized its my shadow I have to get out of here down off this hill He scrambled back down Once he fell clouds of dust obscured everything and he ran from the dusthe hurried faster sliding and tumbling on the loose pebbles Ahead he saw his parked car Im back down he said to himself Im off the hill He plucked open the car door squeezed inside Who threw the stone at me he asked himself No one But why does it bother me Ive undergone it before during fusion While using my empathy box like everyone else This isnt new But it was Because he thought I did it alone Trembling he got a fresh new tin of snuff from the glove compartment of the car pulling off the protective band of tape he took a massive pinch rested sitting half in the car and half out his feet on the arid dusty soil This was the last place to go to he realized I shouldnt have flown here And now he found himself too tired to fly back out If I could just talk to Dave he thought Id be all right I could get away from here go home and go to bed I still have my electric sheep and I still have my job Therell be more andys to retire my career isnt over I havent retired the last andy in existence Maybe thats what it is he thought Im afraid there arent any more He looked at his watch Ninethirty Picking up the vidphone receiver he dialed the Hall of Justice on Lombard Let me speak to Inspector Bryant he said to the police switchboard operator Miss Wild Inspector Bryant is not in his office Mr Deckard hes out in his car but I dont get any answer He must have temporarily left his car Did he say where he intended to go Something about the androids you retired last night Let me talk to my secretary he said A moment later the orange triangular face of Ann Marsten appeared on the screen Oh Mr DeckardInspector Bryant has been trying to get hold of you I think hes turning your name over to Chief Cutter for a citation Because you retired those six I know what I did he said Thats never happened before Oh and Mr Deckard your wife phoned She wants to know if youre all right Are you all right He said nothing Anyhow Miss Marsten said maybe you should call her and tell her She left word shell be home waiting to hear from you Did you hear about my goat he said No I didnt even know you had a goat Rick said They took my goat Who did Mr Deckard Animal thieves We just got a report on a huge new gang of them probably teenagers operating in Life thieves he said I dont understand you Mr Deckard Miss Marsten peered at him intently Mr Deckard you look awful So tired And god your cheek is bleeding Putting his band up he felt the blood From a rock probably More than one evidently had struck him You look Miss Marsten said like Wilbur Mercer I am he said Im Wilbur Mercer Ive permanently fused with him And I cant unfuse Im sitting here waiting to unfuse Somewhere near the Oregon border Shall we send someone out A department car to pick you up No he said Im no longer with the department Obviously you did too much yesterday Mr Deckard she said chidingly What you need now is bed rest Mr Deckard youre our best bounty hunter the best weve ever had Ill tell Inspector Bryant when he comes in you go on home and go to bed Call your wife right away Mr Deckard because shes terribly terribly worried I could tell Youre both in dreadful shape Its because of my goat he said Not the androids Rachael was wrongI didnt have any trouble retiring them And the special was wrong too about my not being able to fuse with Mercer again The only one who was right is Mercer You better get back here to the Bay Area Mr Deckard Where therere people There isnt anything living up there near Oregon isnt that right Arent you alone Its strange Rick said I had the absolute utter completely real illusion that I had become Mercer and people were lobbing rocks at me But not the way you experience it when you hold the handles of an empathy box When you use an empathy box you feel youre with Mercer The difference is I wasnt with anyone I was alone Theyre saying now that Mercer is a fake Mercer isnt a fake he said Unless reality is a fake This hill he thought This dust and these many stones each one different from all the others Im afraid he said that I cant stop being Mercer Once you start its too late to back off Will I have to climb the hill again he wondered Forever as Mercer does  trapped by eternity Goodby he said and started to ring off Youll call your wife You promise Yes He nodded Thanks Ann He hung up Bed rest he thought The last time I hit bed was with Rachael A violation of a statute Copulation with an android absolutely against the law here and on the colony worlds as well She must be back in Seattle now With the other Rosens real and humanoid I wish I could do to you what you did to me he wished But it cant be done to an android because they dont care If I had killed you last night my goat would be alive now Theres where I made the wrong decision Yes he thought it can all be traced back to that and to my going to bed with you Anyhow you were correct about one thing it did change me But not in the way you predicted A much worse way he decided And yet I dont really care Not any longer Not he thought after what happened to me up there toward the top of the hill I wonder what would have come next if I had gone on climbing and reached the top Because thats where Mercer appears to die Thats where Mercers triumph manifests itself there at the end of the great sidereal cycle But if Im Mercer he thought I can never die not in ten thousand years Mercer is immortal Once more he picked up the phone receiver to call his wife And froze CHAPTER 22 He set the receiver back down and did not take his eyes from the spot that had moved outside the car The bulge in the ground among the stones An animal he said to himself And his heart lugged under the excessive load the shock of recognition I know what it is he realized Ive never seen one before but I know it from the old nature films they show on Government TV Theyre extinct he said to himself swiftly he dragged out his muchcreased Sidneys turned the pages with twitching fingers TOAD Bufonidae all varieties  E Extinct for years now The critter most precious to Wilbur Mercer along with the donkey But toads most of all I need a box He squirmed around saw nothing in the back seat of the hovercar he leaped out hurried to the trunk compartment unlocked and opened it There rested a car board container inside it a spare fuel pump for his car He dumped the fuel pump out found some furry hempish twine and walked slowly toward the toad Not taking his eyes from it The toad he saw blended in totally with the texture and shade of the everpresent dust It had perhaps evolved meeting the new climate as it had met all climates before Had it not moved he would never have spotted it yet he had been sitting no more than two yards from it What happens when you findif you findan animal believed extinct he asked himself trying to remember It happened so seldom Something about a star of honor from the UN and a stipend A reward running into millions of dollars And of all possibilitiesto find the critter most sacred to Mercer Jesus he thought it cant be Maybe its due to brain damage on my part exposure to radioactivity Im a special he thought Something has happened to me Like the chickenhead Isidore and his spider what happened to him is happening to me Did Mercer arrange it But Im Mercer I arranged it I found the toad Found it because I see through Mercers eyes He squatted on his haunches close beside the toad It had shoved aside the grit to make a partial hole for itself displaced the dust with its rump So that only the top of its flat skull and its eyes projected above ground Meanwhile its metabolism slowed almost to a halt it had drifted off into a trance The eyes held no spark no awareness of him and in horror he thought Its dead of thirst maybe But it had moved Setting the cardboard box down he carefully began brushing the loose soil away from the toad It did not seem to object but of course it was not aware of his existence When he lifted the toad out he felt its peculiar coolness in his hands its body seemed dry and wrinkledalmost flabbyand as cold as if it had taken up residence in a grotto miles under the earth away from the sun Now the toad squirmed with its weak hind feet it tried to pry itself from his grip wanting instinctively to go flopping off A big one he thought fullgrown and wise Capable in its own fashion of surviving even that which were not really managing to survive I wonder where it finds the water for its eggs So this is what Mercer sees he thought as he painstakingly tied the cardboard box shuttied it again and again Life which we can no longer distinguish life carefully buried up to its forehead in the carcass of a dead world In every cinder of the universe Mercer probably perceives inconspicuous life Now I know he thought And once having seen through Mercers eyes I probably will never stop And no android he thought will cut the legs from this As they did from the chickenheads spider He placed the carefully tied box on the car seat and got in behind the wheel Its like being a kid again he Now all the weight had left him the monumental oppressive fatigue Wait until Iran hears about this he the vidphone receiver started to dial Then paused it as a surprise he concluded Itll only take thirty minutes to fly back there Eagerly he switched the motor on and shortly had zipped up into the sky in the direction of San Francisco seven hundred miles to the south At the Penfield mood organ Iran Deckard sat with her right index finger touching the numbered dial But she did not dial she felt too listless and ill to want anything a burden which closed off the future and any possibilities which it might once have contained If Rick were here she thought hed get me to dial 3 and that way Id find myself wanting to dial something important ebullient joy or if not that then possibly an 888 the desire to watch TV no matter whats on it I wonder what is on it she thought And then she wondered again where Rick had gone He may be coming back and on the other hand he may not be she said to herself and felt her bones within her shrink with age A knock sounded at the apartment door Putting down the Penfield manual she jumped up thinking I dont need to dial now I already have itif it is Rick She ran to the door opened the door wide Hi he said There he stood a cut on his cheek his clothes wrinkled and gray even his hair saturated with dust His hands his facedust clung to every part of him except his eyes Round with awe his eyes shone like those of a little boy he looks she thought as if he has been playing and now its time to give up and come home To rest and wash and tell about the miracles of the day Its nice to see you she said I have something He held a cardboard box with both hands when he entered the apartment he did not set it down As if she thought it contained something too fragile and too valuable to let go of he wanted to keep it perpetually in his hands She said Ill fix you a cup of coffee At the stove she pressed the coffee button and in a moment had put the imposing mug by his place at the kitchen table Still holding the box he seated himself and on his face the roundeyed wonder remained In all the years she had known him she had not encountered this expression before Something had happened since she had seen him last since last night he had gone off in his car Now he had come back and this box had arrived with him he held in the box everything that had happened to him Im going to sleep he announced All day I phoned in and got Harry Bryant he said take the day off and rest Which is exactly what Im going to do Carefully he set the box down on the table and picked up his coffee mug dutifully because she wanted him to he drank his coffee Seating herself across from him she said What do you have in the box Rick A toad Can I see it She watched as he untied the box and removed the lid Oh she said seeing the toad for some reason it frightened her Will it bite she asked Pick it up It wont bite toads dont have teeth Rick lifted the toad out and extended it toward her Stemming her aversion she accepted it I thought toads were extinct she said as she turned it over curious about its legs they seemed almost useless Can toads jump like frogs I mean will it jump out of my hands suddenly The legs of toads are weak Rick said Thats the main difference between a toad and a frog that and water A frog remains near water but a toad can live in the desert I found this in the desert up near the Oregon border Where everything had died He reached to take it back from her But she had discovered something still holding it upside down she poked at its abdomen and then with her nail located the tiny control panel She flipped the panel open Oh His face fell by degrees Yeah so I see youre right Crestfallen he gazed mutely at the false animal he took it back from her fiddled with the legs as if baffledhe did not seem quite to understand He then carefully replaced it in its box I wonder how it got out there in the desolate part of California like that Somebody must have put it there No way to tell what for Maybe I shouldnt have told youabout it being electrical She put her hand out touched his arm she felt guilty seeing the effect it had on him the change No Rick said Im glad to know Or rather He became silent Id prefer to know Do you want to use the mood organ To feel better You always have gotten a lot out of it more than I ever have Ill be okay He shook his head as if trying to clear it still bewildered The spider Mercer gave the chickenhead Isidore it probably was artificial too But it doesnt matter The electric things have their lives too Paltry as those lives are Iran said You look as if youve walked a hundred miles Its been a long day He nodded Go get into bed and sleep He stared at her then as if perplexed It is over isnt it Trustingly he seemed to be waiting for her to tell him as if she would know As if hearing himself say it meant nothing he had a dubious attitude toward his own words they didnt become real not until she agreed Its over she said God what a marathon assignment Rick said Once I began on it there wasnt any way for me to stop it kept carrying me along until finally I got to the Batys and then suddenly I didnt have anything to do And that He hesitated evidently amazed at what he had begun to say That part was worse he said After I finished I couldnt stop because there would be nothing left after I stopped You were right this morning when you said Im nothing but a crude cop with crude cop hands I dont feel that any more she said Im just damn glad to have you come back home where you ought to be She kissed him and that seemed to please him his face lit up almost as much as beforebefore she had shown him that the toad was electric Do you think I did wrong he asked What I did today No Mercer said it was wrong but I should do it anyhow Really weird Sometimes its better to do something wrong than right Its the curse on us Iran said That Mercer talks about The dust he asked The killers that found Mercer in his sixteenth year when they told him he couldnt reverse time and bring things back to life again So now all he can do is move along with life going where it goes to death And the killers throw the rocks its they whore doing it Still pursuing him And all of us actually Did one of them cut your check where its been bleeding Yes he said wanly Will you go to bed now If I set the mood organ to a 670 setting What does that bring about he asked Long deserved peace Iran said He got to his feet stood painfully his face drowsy and confused as if alegion of battles had ebbed and advanced there over many years And then by degrees he progressed along the route to the bedroom Okay he said Long deserved peace he stretched out on the bed dust sifting from his clothes and hair onto the white sheets No need to turn on the mood organ Iran realized as she pressed the button which made the windows of the bedroom opaque The gray light of day disappeared On the bed Rick after a moment slept She stayed there for a time keeping him in sight to be sure he wouldnt wake up wouldnt spring to a sitting position in fear as he sometimes did at night And then presently she returned to the kitchen reseated herself at the kitchen table Next to her the electric toad flopped and rustled in its box she wondered what it ate and what repairs on it would run Artificial flies she decided Opening the phone book she looked in the yellow paces under animal accessories electric  she dialed and when the saleswoman answered said Id like to order one pound of artificial flies that really fly around and buzz please Is it for an electric turtle maam A toad she said Then I suggest our mixed assortment of artificial crawling and flying bugs of all types including The flies will do Iran said Will you deliver I dont want to leave my apartment my husbands asleep and I want to be sure hes all right The clerk said For a toad Id suggest also a perpetually renewing puddle unless its a horned toad in which case theres a kit containing sand multicolored pebbles and bits of organic debris And if youre going to be putting it through its feed cycle regularly I suggest you let our service department make a periodic tongue adjustment In a toad thats vital Fine Iran said I want it to work perfectly My husband is devoted to it She gave her address and hung up And feeling better fixed herself at last a cup of black hot coffee
