POSTHUMAN GLOSSARY

and person ify, acquis it ive greed paired 
with injustice and devast a tion; through 
them multiple scripts unfold, delivered in a

 Mixotricha para doxa was discovered in the 
hindgut of an Australian termite. At the 
time the oddity of this protist or euka ryotic 
microbe was its posses sion of both the
