GULF LABOR

lever age they refuse to acknow ledge. 
 Hard Labour 
 Th ese monu ments are built on the backs of 
migrant workers from Bangladesh, India, 
Pakistan, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka 
and, most recently, Cameroon, Uganda 
and Nigeria, who migrated for a better 
future for them selves and their famil ies. 
Th ey are drawn to the Gulf by economic 
precar ity in their home coun tries, and 
typic ally end up bonded to their work 
through debt under the kafala system, to 
work in construc tion.  
 Ultra Low Wages 
 Th e workers who have been build ing the 
Louvre and the infra struc ture for the rest of 
these cultural insti tu tions are housed in 
remote, segreg ated and surveilled worker 
camps. Th ey incur substan tial debt to leave 
their home country to obtain construc tion 
work that pays very little. Th ey have no 
right to worker repres ent a tion or any form 
of collect ive bargain ing. Th ey organ ize 
strikes, slow downs and the like when they 
are not paid for months or in response to 
poor living condi tions or poor food. In 
retali ation, 
punish ments 
levelled 
by 
employ ers are oft en harsh. Th ey include 
indis crim in ate impris on ment or deport a-
tion, or both.
