Girl at South London Gallery on 26 July 
2014. Th e story was an ode to wetware 
next to the liter ally dry, silicon- based 
transhuman ism discus sion. It took place in 
an oceanic lounge setting consist ing of sea 
sponge bag chairs, blue light and water 
pops icles. Th e spatial aspect was supposed 
to enhance the listen ers’ exper i ence of 
being water, while depict ing humans as 
water’s avatars. Here, I was inter ested in 
both the univer sal ist side of acknow ledging 
ourselves as part of a larger, aqueous 
ecology as well as break ing the extropian 
illu sion of getting rid of the wetware of 
the human state alto gether by saying 
that, in fact, the more reﬁ ned a tech no lo-
gical process is the more it uses (virtual) 
water.
