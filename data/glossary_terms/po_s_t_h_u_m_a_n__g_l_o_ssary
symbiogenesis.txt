SYMBIOGENESIS

of both symbi osis – ‘the system in which 
members of diﬀ er ent species live in phys-
ical contact’ ( Margulis 1998 : 5) – and 
symbio gen esis – ‘the origin of new tissues, 
organs, organ isms – even species – by the 
estab lish ment of long- term or perman ent 
symbi osis’ (ibid.: 6) – tells us some-
thing about their bona ﬁ des as posthu man-
ist tropes ( Clarke 2015 ). Symbiogenesis 
in partic u lar is an aﬀ ront to the human-
ist  ideal of an essen tial human ity 
composed of uniquely human indi vidu als. 
Symbiogenesis under scores the ecolo gical 
multi pli city of all living arrange ments 
taken to their biolo gical found a tions. 
Biological ‘indi vidu al ity’ is always the 
collect ive accom plish ment of a holo bi ont. 
Individuality emerges ‘from the community 
inter ac tions of once inde pend ent actors’ 
( Margulis 1998 : 10–11). Another way to 
put this is that symbi osis and symbio gen-
esis stress the social ity of biolo gical 
systems. Th e discourse of posthu man ism 
fore grounds the recip rocal of this rela tion-
ship – the biolo gical dynam ics of social 
systems – once one’s view of biolo gical 
rela tions has under gone posthu man ist 
recon struc tion. Margulis’s erotic vision of 
life conduces to such revi sions: living 
beings natur ally lust for increas ingly inti-
m ate prox im it ies in increas ingly outland-
ish envir on ments. In her long evol u tion ary 
view of this process, ‘Symbiogenesis was 
the moon that pulled the tide of life from 
its oceanic depths to dry land and up into 
the air’ ( Margulis 1998 : 111).
