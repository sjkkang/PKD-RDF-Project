selec tion of key terms and authors – and a 
crit ical inter ven tion in the ﬁ eld. Th e crit-
ical part tends to emphas ize two main 
dimen sions: the ﬁ rst is the signi ﬁ c ance of 
the neo- mater i al ist approaches and of 
monistic process onto lo gies in contem por-
ary crit ical posthu man theory. Th e second 
is an ethical concern for the rela tion ship 
between new concepts and real- life condi-
tions, with strong emphasis being placed 
through out the volume on the need for 
creat ive responses to the current chal-
lenges. Th is ethical passion drives the 
volume and it also helps shape its aﬀ ect ive 
tone, in terms of account ab il ity, the respect 
for diversity and the convic tion that 
critique and creativ ity work in tandem. In 
this respect, the  Posthuman Glossary may 
be said to both fulﬁ l and defy the usual 
expect a tions and aims of a gloss ary. 
 ANTHROPOS REDUX  
 Th e start ing assump tion of this volume is 
that the histor ical situ ation of today – eco-
lo gic ally, econom ic ally, socio- polit ic ally 
as well as aﬀ ect ively and psych ic ally – is 
unpre ced en ted. We deﬁ ne our era as the 
Anthropocene, 1  by which we under stand 
the geolo gical time when humans are 
having a lasting and negat ive eﬀ ect upon 
the planet’s systems. As the ‘Generation 
Anthropocene’ 2 we believe that new 
notions and terms are needed to address 
the constitu en cies and conﬁ g ur a tions 
of the present and to map future direc-
tions. Th ere is the pres sure of old and new 
contem por ary concerns, such as the

   hat could terms such as ‘alter gorithm’, 
W‘rewild ing’, ‘negen tropy’ and ‘tech-
noan im al ism’ possibly have in common? 
Th e answer lies in the pages of this book: 
they are all neolo gisms that attempt to 
come to terms with the complex it ies of the 
posthu man predic a ment. Every time we 
refer to some of these neolo gisms in the 
intro duc tion, we will insert the inver ted 
commas, as a way of index ing them and 
alert ing the readers to the speciﬁ c incep-
tion of the terms. 
 Th is gloss ary rests on the working 
deﬁ n i tion of the posthu man as a ﬁ eld 
of enquiry and exper i ment a tion that is 
triggered by the conver gence of post-
human ism 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
post- anthro po centrism on the other. 
Posthumanism focuses on the critique of 
the human ist ideal of ‘Man’ as the univer-
sal repres ent at ive of the human, while 
post- anthro po centrism criti cizes species 
hier archy and advances bio- centred egal it-
ari an ism. Equally inter dis cip lin ary in 
char ac ter, they refer back to diﬀ er ent tradi-
tions, cite diﬀ er ent authors and tend to 
take place in- between diﬀ er ent discip lin-
ary areas. Th e conver gence of these two 
strands is produ cing a dynamic new ﬁ eld 
of schol ar ship right now. Accordingly, in 
this  Posthuman Glossary  we take the term 
‘posthu man’ to mark the emer gence of a 
trans dis cip lin ary discourse that is more 
than the sum of posthu man ism and 
post- anthro po centrism, and points to a 
qual it at ive leap in a new – perhaps 
‘post- discip lin ary’ – crit ical direc tion. 
 Th is volume consequently is both an 
attempt to reﬂ ect the current state of 
posthu man schol ar ship – by provid ing a
the wider mater ial world, and with its 
histor ies and events. 3 In a broader sense, 
this gloss ary assumes that the human is 
always partially consti tuted by the non- 
human and that their inter ac tion is too 
complex to be reduced to a mere dialect-
ical oppos i tion. All the more so, as 
nowadays the non- human also involves 
tech no lo gic ally manu fac tured ‘others’ – 
both modern ist appli ances and objects and 
post- indus trial ‘smart’ things. Th e latter 
play a crucial role in deﬁ n ing the posthu-
man moment by stress ing the primacy of 
digital medi ation and elec tronic circuits in 
our self- deﬁ n i tions and inter ac tion. One of 
the chal lenges for the  Posthuman Glossary 
consequently is to devise adequate theor et-
ical and artistic repres ent a tions for the 
new forms of inter con nec tion between 
humans and non- human factors and 
agents. 
 Th e bound ar ies between the ‘inhuman’ 
and the ‘non- human’, however, are porous 
and dynamic. Many schol ars use them 
inter change ably to refer to other- than-
human or less/more- than-human life, 
enlist ing selec ted aspects of geology, 
anthro po logy, 
theo logy, 
zoology 
and 
biology to the task of reach ing an adequate 
under stand ing of these terms. In this 
gloss ary, we try to make crit ical distinc-
tions and by ‘inhuman’ we refer to a double 
phenomenon, which raises both analyt ical 
and norm at ive ques tions. Analytically, the 
term refers to the de- human iz ing eﬀ ects of 
struc tural injustice and exclu sions upon 
entire sections of the human popu la tion 
who have not enjoyed the priv ileges of 
being considered fully human. Gender and 
sexual diﬀ er ence, race and ethni city, class 
and educa tion, health and able- bodied ness 
are crucial markers and gate keep ers of 
accept able ‘human ity’. Th ey are terms that 
index access to the rights, prerog at ives and 
enti tle ments of being human. Th ose who 
are excluded from a domin ant notion of 
changes induced by advanced tech no lo-
gical devel op ments on the one hand and 
the struc tural inequal it ies of the neolib eral 
econom ics of global capit al ism on the 
other. Accordingly, the contrib ut ors to the 
 Posthuman Glossary  analyse both mater ial 
and discurs ive condi tions: soci olo gical 
reality and the more epistemic dimen sions 
are taken together, as two sides of the 
same coin. Th is assumes, as a start ing 
point, a nature–culture continuum that 
deﬁ es binary think ing. In other words, the 
‘compu ta tional turn’ is very ‘earth- bound’ 
and the global economy, however ‘plan et-
ary’, is also emin ently ‘terrestrial’. It is just 
the case that today, the former ‘four 
elements’ (earth, air, water and ﬁ re) have 
mutated into ‘geo- hydro-solar- bio-techno- 
polit ics’. If this sounds puzz ling, it’s because 
it genu inely is so. We need to take on the 
task of think ing diﬀ er ently about our 
current predic a ment. 
 As a consequence of these muta tions, 
two notions that pertain to resid ual 
human ism – the  non -human and the 
 in human – are very import ant for the 
 Posthuman Glossary , because they single 
out acute aspects of our social reality . Th e 
non- human refers to the status of depre ci-
ated natur al ized ‘others’ whose exist ence 
has been cast outside the realm of anthro-
po centric thought and conﬁ ned within 
non- human life ( zoe ). Th ey are, histor ic-
ally, the members of ethni cit ies other than 
the ruling and colo nial European powers. 
But they also refer to veget able, animal and 
earth species and, by now, the genes and 
genomic codes that consti tute the basic 
archi tec ture of Life, or rather its ‘epigen etic 
land scapes’. Th e refer ence to epigen et ics 
(see the entry on Epigenetic Landscape) is 
import ant to this gloss ary, in that it 
contrib utes to a critique of anthro po-
centric genetic determ in ism by stress ing 
that, even at the level of the gene, the 
human is already inter con nec ted with
