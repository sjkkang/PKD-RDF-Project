REWILDING

Siberia, where the rein tro duc tion of bison, 
moose and wild horses aims to trans form 
the water logged and mossy tundra into a 
diverse, grassy steppe, similar to the habitat 
once enjoyed by mammoths. Criticism of 
such projects has focused on the risk that 
intro du cing mega fauna to habit ats that 
have evolved without them for thou sands 
of years could have a negat ive envir on-
mental eﬀ ect, while barbed warn ings about 
the dangers of ‘Frankenstein ecosys tems’ 
high lights the survival within rewild ing 
of the tech no cratic urge to inter fere with 
nature. 
 Debates 
around 
rewild ing 
have 
revolved on the one hand over the choice 
of ‘baseline’, in other words whether we 
should aim to recre ate an approx im a tion 
of a Late Pleistocene land scape or whether 
it is enough to set the clock back to the 
period before the arrival of Europeans. 
Critics of rewild ing, echoing the objec tion 
frequently raised to the Anthropocene 
thesis that it unfairly displaces respons ib il-
ity for ecolo gical crisis from capit al ism and 
colo ni al ism to human ity as a whole, have 
pointed out that by shift  ing the blame for 
the destruc tion of wilder ness onto pre -
his toric hunter- gather ers the enorm ous 
envir on mental impact of Western imper i-
al ism and capit al ist econom ics is minim-
ized. Rather than over com ing the dual istic 
divide between human ity and nature, the 
project of Pleistocene rewild ing can also 
be seen as the most extreme mani fest a tion 
of the modern Western mindset that 
simul tan eously ideal izes the purity of lost 
wilder ness and cham pi ons scientiﬁ c inter-
ven tion to restore it. 
 In addi tion to reviv i fy ing entire ecosys-
tems by rein tro du cing the wild card of 
large pred at ors and missing keystone 
species, rewild ing seeks to provide oppor-
tun it ies for modern society to recon nect 
with the wild. Environmentalist and writer 
George Monbiot has written in  Feral: 
Searching for Enchantment on the Frontiers 
of Rewilding  (2013) about his attempts to 
re- awaken in himself the capa cit ies to 
navig ate a wilder world that lie buried in 
our psycho lo gical make- up, but which are 
dulled by the habits of living in a modern 
economy that has no need for primeval 
mental and phys ical skills. Th e project of 
recon nect ing with suppressed, inner wild-
ness oscil lates between the revival of 
romantic indi vidu al ism and ques tion ing 
the alien a tion from the natural world asso-
ci ated with consumer capit al ism. In this 
regard, anthro po lo gist Eduardo Kohn in 
 How Forest’s Th ink  (2013) has chal lenged 
assump tions about the inev it ab il ity of the 
separ a tion of humans from the natural 
world, demon strat ing that forest creatures 
are able to think, repres ent the world, and 
make meaning without language. Actions 
to rewild culture and society could also be 
funda mental to chan ging the outlook of 
techno- capit al ist society and combat ing 
the malaise of ‘ecolo gical boredom’, a 
passive state of mind that may also account 
for the wide spread indiﬀ er ence to the 
approach ing spectre of ecolo gical disaster. 
 In place of the static, territ orial 
paradigm of the national park, wild ness is 
conceived by rewilders as a ﬂ uid category 
that can occur in all types of land- and 
seascapes, and on a micro as well as a 
macro scale, while optim istic signs of 
natural resi li ence are iden ti ﬁ ed in cases of 
the re- colon iz a tion by animals of urban as 
well as rural areas as humans retreat. 
Rewilding is also self- consciously geared 
not towards achiev ing the human- deﬁ ned 
end state of ‘wilder ness’, but rather aims to 
set in motion natural dynam ics that will 
ulti mately result in autonom ous habit ats 
and self- managing land scapes. Rewilding 
could be seen as an Anthropocene notion 
par excel lence, since it recog nizes the 
unique respons ib il ity of the human race
