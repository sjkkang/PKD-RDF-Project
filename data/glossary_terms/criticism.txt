CRITICISM

Th e posthu man condi tion is marked by 
rampant outsourced, oﬀ shore exploit a tion 
of labour, invis ible ecolo gical degrad a tion 
that unravels over decades and even 
centur ies in lands distant from most of the 
consumers of extrac ted natural resources, 
and a growing number of displaced 
persons and diasporic popu la tions. Th e 
rippling reper cus sions of these press ing 
chal lenges are of a plan et ary scale. Th is 
puts into ques tion the adequacy and rele -
v ance of human ist repres ent a tional and 
struc tural conven tions in liter at ure and 
criti cism. 
 Posthuman liter ary criti cism ( Taylor

 Badmington 2011 ;  Lee 2014 ;  Sheehan 
2015 ;  Dinello 2005 ) is an exer cise in trans- 
discip lin ar ity. It intro duces to crit ical 
inquiry monistic vital ism that celeb rates 
the act of think ing as a creation of new 
concepts. Th e inter spers ing of discip lines 
depends on de- famil i ar iz a tion with accus-
tomed habits of thought under the current 
discip lin ary split in the human ist academy. 
Literature is crucial in this joining of 
discip lines as it comple ments scientiﬁ c 
inquiry less prone or open to processes of 
becom ing or diﬀ er en ti ation in a Deleuzian 
monistic onto logy. 
 In posthu man liter ary criti cism, creativ-
ity and critique is a concur rent, dynamic 
prac tice that activ ates, de- territ ori al izes 
stable iden tit ies, and forms aﬃ  rm at ive and 
altern at ive subjects. It rejects linear ity and 
ques tions the exist ence of Truth and cent-
ral ity of Man in the text. Linearity in the 
form of blind defer ence to the author ity of 
estab lished narrat ives of the past prevents 
the creation of new concep tual personae 
and ﬁ gur a tions. Th is calls for a non- linear 
vision of memory as imagin a tion, creation 
as becom ing.
