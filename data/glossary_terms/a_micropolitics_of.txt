A MICROPOLITICS OF

In this entry I examine the possib il ity of a 
micro pol it ics of posthu man rights which 
subverts the major it arian model of human 
rights, ﬁ gured as a certain kind of think ing 
diverse actants as part of more diverse, 
dynamic social collect ives and exten ded 
networks (cf.  Hodder 2012 ). Its solid ity acts 
as a stand- in for its distrib uted actants and 
the agen cies that make up the bucket (cf 
 Bennett 2010 ;  Coole and Frost 2010 ). In 
consid er ing the bucket as ‘thing ness’ and as 
‘compos i tion’, and the descrip tion of its 
elements, mater i als and stories attrib uted 
to it as ‘actants’ and as ‘agency’, and the term 
‘perform ativ ity’ to describe the inter ac tion 
of the actants as part of the exten ded, 
networked compos i tion, allows us to move 
beyond the social construc tion of the 
‘object’, ‘arte fact’ and ‘collec tion’. Where 
conven tional terms promoted a sole focus 
on social and cultural conven tions of 
language, describ ing, naming and narrat-
ing histor ies and personal accounts as 
bounded objects, these new terms gesture 
towards their rela tional re- conﬁ g ur a tion 
that take account of the active and 
entangled life of all its compon ents. 
 Th e shift  of social subjectiv ity from the 
human to include the non- human world 
through the attri bu tion of each of the 
objects’ elements as actants, and the many 
ways these rela tional subjects are entangled 
and folded together, better illus trate the 
agentic or anim ated rela tion ships we have 
to life in general. Th e inter ac tion of these 
multiple rela tional subjects also consti tutes 
collect ive forms of social agency which 
will promote new under stand ings of 
history as emer gent from within these 
more- than- human 
collect ives. 
Th e 
compos i tion also promotes new forms of 
human civic life and social ity to include 
animate and inan im ate things compris ing, 
vari ously, tech no logy, mater i al ity, trees, 
climatic systems, humans and discourses, 
each as rela tional subjects and together as 
collect ive forms of agency. Th is more 
inclus ive vision of a shared world has the 
poten tial to promote and enhance respect 
and ethical concern for diversity of both
