RATIONALIST INHUMANISM

A univer sal wave that erases the self- 
portrait of man drawn in sand, inhu man-
ism is a vector of revi sion. It relent lessly 
revises what it means to be human by 
remov ing its supposedly self- evident 
char ac ter ist ics while preserving certain 
invari ances. 
 Negarestani 2014a : 427 
 Insofar as the concept of the human artic-
u lates our cultural self- under stand ing it is 
not merely subject to passive change – as 
we have seen in the trans itions between 
pre- clas sical, clas sical and modern eras – 
but open to active revi sion in accord ance 
with the norm of collect ive self- determ in-
a tion. Inhumanism turns human ism’s 
commit ment to self- determ in a tion upon 
itself by elab or at ing the consequences of 
this radical revis ab il ity. 
 Th e theor et ical consequence is the 
dissec tion of the empirico- tran scend ental 
doublet and a renewed  tran scend ent al ism : 
‘reject ing not only psycho lo gism and 
histor icism, but all concrete forms of the 
anthro po lo gical preju dice, we attempt to 
ques tion afresh the limits of thought, and to 
renew contact in this way with the project 
for a general critique of reason’ ( Foucault 
2002 : 372). Th e ‘invari ances’ that cannot be 
revised in the process of self- determ in a tion 
are precisely the condi tions of possib il ity of 
revi sion and self- determ in a tion them-
selves. Th is dissec tion of ‘Man’ extracts the 
univer sal subject of clas sical ration al ism 
from its empir ical clad ding, ﬂ aying the 
mascu line, 
bour geois 
and 
European 
speciﬁ cit ies hidden behind its supposed 
other world li ness from its abstract oper a-
tional form, and leaving nothing but a set of 
func tions that can be real ized in diverse 
mater ial substrates and diver gent forms of 
life: humans, animals, aliens and machines 
alike can adopt the role of sapient subjects 
and autonom ous agents, so long as they 
possess the corres pond ing capa cit ies. Th e 
connec tion between Kantian critique and 
 AGI  lies in their concern with provid ing 
the most  minimal  descrip tion of these 
capa cit ies: a func tional diagram of what 
some thing would have to do to be  gener ally 
capable of thought and action ( Deutsch 
2012 ). 
 Th e prac tical consequence is a form of 
 promethean ism commen sur ate with trans-
human ism: ‘the project of re- engin eer ing 
ourselves and our world on a more 
rational basis’ ( Brassier 2014b : 487). If 
inhu man ism 
treats 
‘supposedly 
self- 
evident char ac ter ist ics’ of human ity – such 
as voca tional social ity, dimorphic sexu al-
ity, or terrestrial domest icity – as concep-
tual determ in a tions to be discarded in 
search ing for minimal condi tions for 
abstract autonomy, then promethean ism 
treats these same char ac ter ist ics as empir-
ical obstacles to be surmoun ted in achiev-
ing maximal condi tions for concrete 
freedom. Th ere are distinct promethean 
projects concerned with each obstacle just 
mentioned: accel er a tion ism strives to turn 
the eman cip at ory tend en cies of modern ity 
against the oppress ive social ity of capit al-
ism ( Srnicek and Williams 2014 ), xeno-
fem in ism aims to harness the arti ﬁ  ci al ity 
of iden tity by reject ing the given ness of 
mater ial condi tions (sex) and social forms 
(gender) alike ( Laboria Cuboniks 2015 ), 
and cosmism enjoins us ‘to consider the 
earth a trap’, treat ing gravity as one more 
constraint to be over come by the ‘gener al-
ised escapo logy’ of design ( Singleton 
2014 ). Th e inhu man ism of these projects 
lies in their embrace of  alien a tion as a 
posit ive force, trans form ing our progress-
ive exile from a series of edenic harmon ies 
– be they economic, soci olo gical or envir-
on mental – into an esoteric gene a logy of 
freedom. 
 Ultimately, what diﬀ er en ti ates crit ical 
and spec u lat ive posthu man ism from 
ration al ist inhu man ism is that they over-
come ‘Man’ by renew ing meta phys ics
