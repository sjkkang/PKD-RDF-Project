NON-HUMAN AGENCY

no doubt bring about unknown futures’ 
(2010: 563). Yet it seems that these 
unknown futures are already here, and 
seem ingly have been and will be for the 
unfore see able future of the planet (hence 
the 
dawning 
recog ni tion 
of 
the 
Anthropocene). Th ese uncer tain pasts, 
presents and futures, born from the intra- 
activ ity of entangled human and non- 
human agen cies, are constantly becom ing 
anew and chan ging the ways in which we 
become- with them. Th us, the quest to 
recog nize the many other- than-human 
agen cies that intra- act in our becom ing- 
with(in) the world, an import ant aspect of 
the posthu man project, may be a crucial 
step in craft  ing more open and cooper at ive 
approaches for attend ing to our (human or 
not) possible futures, where perhaps all life 
may be able to continue and ﬂ our ish in the 
continu ing age of the Anthropocene. If we 
are to construct new ethical para met ers, 
appro pri ate to our continu ing anthro po-
genic times, for the inter ven tions we seek 
to enact, then non- human agen cies must 
be taken seri ously as the world- build ing 
forces that they also have always already 
been.
