A

monistic onto logy, as both mater ial and 
vital, oﬀ ers possib il it ies of ground ing the 
embod ied and embed ded posthu man 
subject in process (Braidotti 2006b). 
Moreover, by focus ing on the dynamic 
inter ac tion of Sameness and Diﬀ erence, 
monism moves outside the scheme of 
dialect ical oppos i tion, stress ing instead the 
gener at ive force of living matter itself 
( Ansell Pearson 1997 ,  1999 ). Freed from 
the distinc tion between natural and 
construc ted events, a monistic philo sophy 
of 
intel li gent, 
self- organ iz ing 
matter 
produces a mater i al ist polit ical physics and 
‘polit ical aﬀ ect’ ( Bonta and Protevi 2004 ; 
 Protevi 2001 ,  2009 ,  2013 ). 
 Th e inﬂ u ence of Deleuze and Guattari’s 
ideas, which is felt strongly in this volume, 
is, however, not exclus ive. Several contrib-
ut ors follow diﬀ er ent ways of ‘matter ing’, 
that is to say of explor ing matter as a 
dynamic process. Many other process- 
oriented onto lo gies are at work, for 
instance in the refer ences to Derrida, 
Whitehead, 
Wittgenstein, 
Meillassoux, 
Latour, Haraway and others. A major point 
of theor et ical conver gence between them 
is the need to over come binar ies and to 
state that matter, the world and humans 
them selves are not dual istic entit ies struc-
tured accord ing to dialect ical prin ciples of 
internal or external oppos i tion, but rather 
mater i ally embed ded subjects- in-process 
circu lat ing within webs of rela tion with 
forces, entit ies and encoun ters.
