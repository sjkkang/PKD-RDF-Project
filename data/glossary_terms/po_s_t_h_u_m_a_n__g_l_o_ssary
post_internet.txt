POST INTERNET

Internet with the social, as the social. 
Th rough mobile, Wi-Fi and cloud comput-
ing, the processes of sensory embod i ment 
(how these tech no lo gies help users exper i-
ence their envir on ment) erase previ ous 
distinc tions such as those between produ-
cer, consumer and distrib utor ( Farman 
2012 ;  Hu 2015 ;  Easterling 2014 ) – blur ring 
these into the increas ingly homo lin gual 
ﬁ gure of the user ( Wright 2013 ): a user 
who, as bots, the inter net of things, and 
compos ite Post Internet artworks attest 
to, is no longer neces sar ily human. Th is 
rebirth as a condi tion deﬁ nes a quant it at-
ive shift  in the onto lo gical treat ment of 
digital-non- digital tech no lo gical hybrids 
on both sides of the posthu man ambi val-
ence. Th is includes inter leav ing with, and 
de- cent ring, diﬀ er ence through connec-
tions to previ ously out of reach global 
other ness on the one hand ( Nakamura 
and Chow-White 2012 ), and the use and 
repro duc tion of domin ant, stand ard ized 
distri bu tion, produc tion plat forms and 
proto cols which redeﬁ ne much of the space 
formerly known as oﬄ  ine ( Galloway and 
Th acker 2007 ;  Abreu 2015 ), on the other. 
 Th e term Post Internet’s gener a tional 
speciﬁ city and genesis among the insti tu-
tions of art ( Archey 2012 ) remains 
nonethe less 
of 
great 
import ance. 
Condensing varied prac tices into a discrete 
move ment ( Vickers 2013 ;  Chan 2014 ), Post 
Internet art came to be criti cized for its 
appar ent compli city with a glob al ized art 
market, and inab il ity to negate the priv ilege 
of the gallery ( Vickers 2013 ;  Droitcour 
2014a ,  2014b ; Vickers in  Scrimgeour 
2014 );  1 and ulti mately for being unable to 
separ ate itself from the discurs ive and 
struc tural priv ileges (leisure- time, master’s- 
level art educa tion and access to expens ive 
tech no lo gies) it oft en relied on (resist ances 
to these priv ileges and struc tural condi-
tions notwith stand ing) ( Quaintance 2015 ; 
‘poor’ images ( Steyerl 2009 ,  2012 ), to 
networks or systems of art- making that 
neces sar ily comprise both online and 
oﬄ  ine elements (Vickers in  Scrimgeour 
2014 ), what is central to Post Internet art’s 
initial assembly of deﬁ n able works was its 
chal lenge to the estab lished cannons of art, 
inter net discourse and, crucially, to the 
primacy of the phys ical gallery space and 
original artwork ( Vierkant 2010 ). In part, 
eliding distinc tions between real and virtual 
reclaimed the form a tion of subjectiv ity 
from the sort of Cartesian dualism that had 
separ ated the mind from ‘meat space’ (as in 
John Perry Barlow’s ‘Declaration of the 
Independence of Cyberspace’ ( 1996 ;  Berry 
1998 ), but it also posed the embed ding of 
the inter net in the every day as a given 
( Novitskova 2010 ;  McHugh 2011 ). 
 While a diﬀ er ence in degree – being 
on/oﬄ  ine – consti tuted the core diﬀ er ence 
in kind for Post Internet art, the Internet 
has by now become so dissol ute, more 
cloud than web, that it dissolves any partic-
u lar trac tion or rupture that the notion of 
Post the inter net once may have had. As 
artist Jesse Darling put it, ‘every artist 
working today is a Post Internet artist’ 
( 2014 ). Further, the ﬂ uid and evasive 
techno- polit ics of the inter net, meshing 
war and surveil lance with the tech no lo gies 
of vision and image ( Braidotti 2013 : 8; 
 Schuppli 2014a ;  Steyerl 2009 ,  2012 ), and 
the hybrid sover eignty of data, users and 
their parti cip a tion with the ‘necro pol itcs of 
the cloud’ (Hu 2015), can be said to have 
been eclipsed by Post Internet art in a 
machinic- social continuum that bends 
Post Internet around the posthu man 
condi tion.
