PO S T H U M A N  G L O SSARY
MULTIVERSE

terms of the posthu man multi verse; both 
should be listed in order to disrupt the 
dualism one/many, thus avoid turning this 
discus sion into the problem of the origins 
(is it a mon ism before being a plur al ism, 
or a plur al ism before being a monism?). 
Th e rhizome (Deleuze and Guattari 1980) 
oﬀ ers numer ous insights for a posthu man 
devel op ment of the multi verse, even 
though philo soph ic ally the two notions 
cannot be assim il ated. For instance, the 
posthu man multi verse does not neces sar-
ily exclude the notion of a struc ture, but 
approaches it in a process- onto lo gical 
way. 6  In the frame of the multi verse, 
humans, as any other mani fest a tions 
of being, can be perceived as nodes of 
becom ing in mater ial networks; such 
becom ings operate as tech no lo gies of the 
multi verse, 
as 
modes 
of ‘reveal ing’ 
( Heidegger 1954 ), thus re- access ing the 
onto lo gical and exist en tial signi ﬁ c a tions 
of tech no logy itself. In such a frame, the 
multi verse can be perceived as a mater ial 
and meta phor ical path of self- discov ery, 
once the self has been recog nized as the 
others within.
