A code comment in  model ing_modi ﬁ  ers_
desc.json , a ﬁ le that deﬁ nes the modi ﬁ c a-
tions oper ated by the sliders, explains that 
‘Proportions of the human features, oft en 
subject ively referred to as qual it ies of 
beauty (min is unusual, center posi tion is 
average and max is ideal istic propor tions)’,

   10. In response to a user suggest ing making 
the sliders more expli cit (‘It really does not 
really make any sense for a char ac ter to be 
anything other than 100% male or female, 
but then again its more appear ance based 
than actual sex.’), developer Manuel 
Bastioni responds that it is ‘not easy’: ‘For 
example, weight = 0.5 is not a ﬁ xed value. 
It depends by the age, the gender, the 
percent age of muscle and fat, and the 
height. If you are making an adult giant, 
8 ft , fully muscu lar, your 0.5 weight is X . . . 
In other words, it’s not linear’,  http://

   11. MakeHuman is developed in Python, a 
program ming language that is relat ively 
access ible for non- tech nical users and 
does not require compil a tion aft er 
changes to the program are made. 
   12. When the program starts up, a warning 
message is displayed that ‘MakeHuman 
is a char ac ter creation suite. It is designed 
for making anatom ic ally correct humans. 
Parts of this program may contain 
nudity. Do you want to proceed?’

 3. Th e poten tial of soft  ware as a ‘think ing 
machine’ is that it can activ ate mech-
anisms of know ledge produc tion, of 
not- only-text- based crit ical theory: ‘A 
carto graphy is a theor et ic ally based and 
polit ic ally informed reading of the 
present. Cartographies aim at epistemic 
and ethical account ab il ity by unveil ing 
the power loca tions which struc ture our 
subject- posi tion’ ( Braidotti 2013 : 164).
