TECHNOANIMALISM

about taking oﬀ  the toy panda’s skin with 
the greatest possible preci sion. We could 
endlessly discuss the various diﬀ er ent 
signs being created as the proced ures takes 
place, as the knives care fully remove the 
fur from the paws, the glue from the eye. 
Th e name of the perform ance,  Naked , 
nicely captures the ambi gu ity as it poses 
the ques tion at what moment the panda is 
truly naked (perhaps being liber ated from 
the skin is all about releas ing the mech an-
ism from its ‘toy iden tity’?). Much more 
urgent, however, is the ongoing and – we 
need to mention this again – very  care fully 
carried out surgery on this toy panda that 
 keeps on making unpleas ant sounds and 
clumsy move ments. Even the surgeon is 
not at all at ease with the situ ation. At times 
he seems very nervous, even cutting 
himself in the glove, and actu ally admit ted 
aft er wards that this was a very ‘trau mat iz-

video we are left  with a seri ously unpleas-
ant feeling. But why? 
 Aft er perform ances such as  Do you 
Mind? or aft er showing the video piece  Gaze 
or  Naked , people from the audi ence oft en 
show an urge to talk about their reac tions. 
Th ey describe how disturbed they become 
by their own reac tions and emotional 
responses while watch ing this. Th e most 
disturb ing thing, they say, is that they ﬁ nd 
them selves react ing more strongly watch ing 
the mech an ical panda on the oper a tion table 
(in  Naked ) then if it had been a real person. 
 It is at this very short moment between 
percep tion and the rational ‘correc tion’ 
that ‘the shock to thought’, which only art 
can give, happens. Only then the Animal-
Machine hypo thesis, as it is so deeply 
engraved in our think ing, is funda ment ally 
critiqued. Suddenly someone in the audi-
ence walks up to the artist and asks, ‘Why
