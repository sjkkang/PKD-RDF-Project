POSTMEDIEVAL

‘crit ical human isms’, as well as to develop a 
more present- minded premod ern studies. 
 Medieval cultural studies – also known 
as studies in medi ev al ism or medi ev al ism 
studies – have been concerned, in fact, with 
the recep tion and repres ent a tion of the 
Middle Ages across various periods, genres 
and media, as well as with all of the ways in 
which the Middle Ages have been  inven ted 
and  construc ted by writers and schol ars from 
the Renaissance forward, and with the gene-
a lo gies of the profes sional  academic discip-
line of medi eval studies, which is oft en at 
pains to distin guish itself from a ‘medi ev al-
ism’ believed to not be concerned enough 
with a so- called ‘real’ medi eval history. 
 Th e ques tion of the alter it ism of the 
medi eval past is crit ical here because, for 
schol ars working in the vein of tradi tional 
histor icism, the Middle Ages is always 
‘other’ to the present, whereas for some 
schol ars working in studies in medi ev al-
ism ‘the medi eval’ (whatever that might 
ulti mately mean) is always partly a func-
tion, product and  eﬀ ect of any partic u lar 
present trying to grapple with the epistem-
o lo gies of the Middle Ages as well as with 
its rela tion (or supposed non- rela tion) to 
the modern and post mod ern ( Joy 2009 ). 
Studies in medi ev al ism thus demon strate 
the always inter sect ing traject or ies of the 
medi eval, modern and post mod ern and 
also reveal the ways in which the academic 
ﬁ eld of medi eval studies is itself a form of 
medi ev al ism, for in medi eval studies it is 
always a repres ent a tion of the Middle Ages 
that is being construc ted, as opposed to 
deliv er ing some sort of medi eval pres ence. 
 It is in this vein that the  BABEL 
Working Group and more speciﬁ c ally 
Eileen Joy founded  postme di eval: a journal 
of medi eval cultural studies in 2009. 
 postme di eval is a cross- discip lin ary, peer- 
reviewed journal in medi eval studies that 
aims to bring the medi eval and modern 
at Georgetown University in Washington 
 DC . Th e event was devoted to explor ing 
the ways in which medi eval liter ary studies 
were being recon ceived and redeﬁ ned via 
the models for social and cultural history 
developed in contem por ary work on 
cultural studies and post mod ern theory. 
One of the main aims of this confer ence 
was, in fact, to under stand what cultural 
studies could oﬀ er medi eval studies and, 
more import antly, what medi eval studies 
could oﬀ er cultural studies. Th is ground- 
break ing event was inspired by and also 
led to much signi ﬁ c ant work in medi eval 
studies 
that 
collect ively 
repres en ted 
import ant forays into medi eval cultural 
studies, such as Louise Fradenburg and 
Carla Freccero’s  Premodern Sexualities 
(1996), Fradenburg’s   Sacriﬁ ce Your Love: 
Psychoanalysis, 
Historicism, 
Chaucer 
(2001), Kathleen Biddick’s   Th e Shock of 
Medievalism (1998), Glenn Burger and 
Steven Kruger’s  Queering the Middle Ages 
(2001), Jeﬀ rey Jerome Cohen’s  Of Giants: 
Sex, Monsters, and the Middle Ages (1999) 
and  Th e Postcolonial Middle Ages (2000), 
Carolyn Dinshaw’s  Getting Medieval: 
Sexualities and Communities, Pre- and 
Postmodern 
(1999), 
Karma 
Lochrie’s 
 Heterosyncracies: Female Sexuality Before 
Normal Wasn’t (2005), and Paul Strohm’s 
 Th eory and the Premodern Text (2000). 
 Following, and wanting to build upon, 
the surge of works paving the way for the 
estab lish ment of a newly inter dis cip lin ary 
ﬁ eld of medi eval cultural studies, the 
 BABEL Working Group was founded in 
2004. As a collect ive of schol ars oper at ing 
primar ily in the ﬁ elds of medi eval and 
early modern studies, but also purpose-
fully drawing in schol ars from later periods 
and crit ical and cultural theory in North 
America, the  UK , and Australia, they have 
since been working to develop new cross- 
discip lin ary alli ances between the human-
it ies, sciences, social sciences and the arts
