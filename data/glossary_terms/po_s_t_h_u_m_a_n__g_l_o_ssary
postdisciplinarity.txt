POSTDISCIPLINARITY

work beyond them. I have also sugges ted 
a distinc tion between post- and trans dis-
cip lin ar ity ( Lykke 2010 ,  2011 ), based on 
the ways in which the two terms have been 
used in some schol arly contexts. While 
trans dis cip lin ar ity oft en signi ﬁ es modes 
of working with know ledge produc tion, 
postdis cip lin ar ity more oft en refers to 
modes of organ iz ing this produc tion. 
Sue-Ellen Case provides an example here, 
when she uses the notion of postdis cip lin-
ar ity to suggest ‘that the organ iz ing struc-
tures of discip lines them selves will not 
hold’ (Case 2001: 150), compar ing the 
discip line- disrupt ive poten tials of inter-
sec tions of femin ist theory and perform-
ance studies.

approach is more and more being taken to 
bear on empir ical research, includ ing social 
research. Here it implies that concep tual 
frame works should not be applied as discip-
lin ar ily canon ized grids to be imposed on 
the mater ial. While meth od o lo gies are 
considered as perform at ive and world-
making ( Coleman and Ringrose 2013 : 1), 
the mater ial should be approached in such 
open- ended ways that what Deleuze calls 
‘non- preex ist ent concepts’ ( Deleuze 1987 : 
vii) can be extrac ted from it ( Coleman and 
Ringrose 2013 : 10). 
 In terms of concep tual gene a lo gies, 
postdis cip lin ar ity has been less commonly 
used than trans dis cip lin ar ity. However, 
some femin ist schol ars have, for example, 
found it appro pri ate to signify a wished- 
for trans form a tion of the discip lin ary 
univer sity with the concept of postdis cip-
lin ar ity. I have argued for femin ist studies 
as a post- discip line due to its radical claims 
to decon struct all discip lin ary canons
