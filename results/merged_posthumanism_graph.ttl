at the University of Minnesota Press you know who you are and especially to Press director Doug Armato for his boundless intellectual enthusiasm and editorial support Finally and most of all I thank my lucky stars for Allison artist and soul mate xi Introduction What Is Posthumanism It is perhaps an appropriately posthumanist gesture to begin this book with the results of a Google search As I write in summer of 2008 if you Google humanism youll be rewarded with 3840000 hits posthumanism yields a mere 60200 Apparently humanism is alive and well despite reports of its demise You will notice at a cur sory glance that despite the discrepancy in numbers there appears to be much more unanimity about humanism than posthumanism Most definitions of humanism look something like the following one from Wikipedia Humanism is a broad category of ethical philosophies that affirm the dignity and worth of all people based on the ability to determine right and wrong by appeal to universal human qualitiesparticularly ra tionality It is a component of a variety of more specific philosophical systems and is incorporated into several religious schools of thought Humanism entails a commitment to the search for truth and morality through human means in support of human interests In focusing on the capacity for selfdetermination humanism rejects the validity of transcendental justifications such as a dependence on belief without reason the supernatural or texts of allegedly divine origin Humanists endorse universal morality based on the commonality of the human condition suggesting that solutions to human social and cultural prob lems cannot be parochial Posthumanism on the other hand generates different and even irrec oncilable definitions The Web site wwwposthumanismcom provides a gloss on the term that most of the philosophers and scholars named on Wikipedias page for posthumanismMichel Foucault Judith Butler Bruno Latour and Donna Haraway among otherswould not just refine but for the most part oppose For the purposes of this book I choose to see in this confusion not a cautionary tale but an opportunity introduction xii The term posthumanism itself seems to have worked its way into contemporary critical discourse in the humanities and social sci ences during the mid1990s though its roots go back in one genealogy at least to the 1960s and pronouncements of the sort made famous by Foucault in the closing paragraph of The Order of Things An Archaeology of the Human Sciences where he writes that the historical appearance of this thing called man was not the transition into luminous consciousness of an ageold concern the entry into objectivity of something that had long remained trapped within beliefs and philosophies it was the effect of a change in the fundamental arrangements of knowledge As the archaeology of our thought easily shows man is an invention of recent date And one per haps nearing its end If those arrangements were to disappear as they appeared if some event of which we can at the moment do no more than sense the possibilitywithout knowing either what its form will be or what it promiseswere to cause them to crumble as the ground of Classical thought did at the end of the eighteenth century then one can cer tainly wager that man would be erased like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea1 By way of another wellknown genealogyone also directly relevant to this bookposthumanism may be traced to the Macy conferences on cybernetics from 1946 to 1953 and the invention of systems the ory involving Gregory Bateson Warren McCulloch Norbert Wiener John von Neumann and many other figures from a range of fields who converged on a new theoretical model for biological mechanical and communicational processes that removed the human and Homo sapi ens from any particularly privileged position in relation to matters of meaning information and cognition More recently the term has begun to emerge with different and sometimes competing meanings The first time I used it hyphenated no less was in an essay from 1995 called In Search of Posthumanist Theory on the work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela in a special double issue of Cultural Critique called The Politics of Systems and Environments that I coedited with William Rasch2 That project included a roundtable conversation with Niklas Luhmann and Katherine Hayles Hayles picked up the term with a rather differ xiii introduction ent valence as we will see in a moment in her book How We Became Posthuman 1999 Meanwhile in the United Kingdom critics such as Neil Badmington and Elaine Graham gravitated toward the term with Badmingtons edited collection Posthumanism 2000 being a notable at tempt at consolidation3 That body of work in the UK as suggested by the title of Badmingtons subsequent book Alien Chic Posthumanism and the Other Within and by Grahams Representations of the PostHuman Monsters Aliens and Others in Popular Culture tended toward a sense of posthumanism perhaps best glossed as Badmington rightly introduction xiv empirical science and critical reasonrather than revelation and re ligious authorityas ways of learning about the natural world and our place within it and of providing a grounding for morality Trans humanism has its roots in rational humanism6 To help make his point Bostrom invokes Kants famous essay of 1784 What Is Enlightenment Enlightenment is mans leaving his selfcaused immaturity Immaturity is the incapacity to use ones own understanding without the guidance of another    The motto of en lightenment is therefore Sapere aude Have courage to use your own in telligence7 Here however it is useful to recall Foucaults suggestion from his essay of 1984 by the same title that if we commit to a perma nent critique of ourselves then we must avoid the always too facile confusions between humanism and Enlightenment because the hu manistic thematic is in itself too supple too diverse too inconsistent to serve as an axis for reflection Indeed as Foucault xv introduction invoked by Balibars reference to the humanityanimality dichotomy namely that the human is achieved by escaping or repressing not just its animal origins in nature the biological and the evolutionary but more generally by transcending the bonds of materiality and em bodiment altogether In this respect my sense of posthumanism is the opposite of transhumanism and in this light transhumanism should be seen as an intensification of humanism Indeed one wellknown fig ure associated with transhumanism Hans Moravec draws Hayless ire for precisely this reason When Moravec imagines you choosing to download yourself into a computer thereby obtaining through techno logical mastery the ultimate privilege of immortality Hayles writes he is not abandoning the autonomous liberal subject but is expanding its prerogatives into the realm of the posthuman10 Hayles is no doubt right and though she is quick to add that the posthuman need not be recuperated back into liberal humanism nor need it be construed as antihuman the net effect and critical ground tone of her book as many have noted are to associate the posthuman with a kind of trium phant disembodiment11 Hayless use of the term in other words tends to oppose embodiment and the posthuman whereas the sense in which I am using the term here insists on exactly the opposite posthumanism in my sense isnt posthuman at allin the sense of being after our embodiment has been transcendedbut is only posthumanist in the sense that it opposes the fantasies of disembodiment and autonomy inherited from humanism itself that Hayles rightly criticizes My sense of posthumanism is thus analogous to JeanFrançois Lyotards paradoxical rendering of the postmodern it comes both be fore and after humanism before in the sense that it names the embodi ment and embeddedness of the human being in not just its biological but also its technological world the prosthetic coevolution of the human animal with the technicity of tools and external archival mechanisms such as language and culture of which Bernard Stiegler probably re mains our most compelling and ambitious theoristand all of which comes before that historically specific thing called the human that Foucaults archaeology excavates12 But it comes after in the sense that posthumanism names a historical moment in which the decentering of the human by its imbrication in technical medical informatic and economic networks is increasingly impossible to ignore a historical introduction xvi development that points toward the necessity of new theoretical para digms but also thrusts them on us a new mode of thought that comes after the cultural repressions and fantasies the philosophical protocols and evasions of humanism as a historically specific phenomenon Here we would do well to recall Foucaults insistence on the dif ference between humanism and Enlightenment thoughtnamely that humanisms anthropological universals underwrite a dogma for which the Enlightenment if we are true to its spirit should have no patience As Foucault puts it In this connection I believe that this the matic which so often recurs and which always depends on humanism can be opposed by the principle of a critique and a permanent creation of ourselves in our autonomy that is a principle that is at the heart of the historical consciousness that the Enlightenment has of itself From this standpoint I am inclined to see Enlightenment and humanism in a state of tension rather than identity13 It is precisely at this juncture that I want to locate a fundamental intervention that this book attempts to make namely that even if we admire humanisms suspicion toward revelation and religious authority whose stakes are all the more pitched at the current geopolitical moment14 and even if we take the additional posthumanist step of rejecting the various anthropological political and scientific dogmas of the human that Foucault insists are in tension with Enlightenment per se we must take yet another step another post and realize that the nature of thought itself must change if it is to be posthumanist What this means is that when we talk about posthumanism we are not just talking about a thematics of the decentering of the human in relation to either evolutionary ecological or technological coordi nates though that is where the conversation usually begins and all too often ends rather I will insist that we are also talking about how thinking confronts that thematics what thought has to become in the face of those challenges Here the spirit of my intervention is akin to Foucaults in What Is Enlightenment the point is not to reject hu manism tout courtindeed there are many values and aspirations to admire in humanismbut rather to show how those aspirations are undercut by the philosophical and ethical frameworks used to concep tualize them To take only two examples that I discuss later in this book most of us would probably agree that cruelty toward animals is xvii introduction a bad thing or that people with disabilities deserve to be treated with respect and equality But as we will see the philosophical and theo retical frameworks used by humanism to try to make good on those commitments reproduce the very kind of normative subjectivitya specific concept of the humanthat grounds discrimination against nonhuman animals and the disabled in the first place Similar limitations may be identified not just in the post of trans humanism but also in some who rightly criticize it As R L Rutsky points out with regard to Hayless governing theoretical model The posthuman cannot simply be identified as a culture or age that comes after the human for the very idea of such a passage however mea sured or qualified it may be continues to rely upon a humanist narra tive of historical change    If however the posthuman truly involves a fundamental change or mutation in the concept of the human this would seem to imply that history and culture cannot continue to be figured in reference to this concept15 In other words there are hu manist ways of criticizing the extension of humanism that we find in transhumanism or bad posthumanism Rutsky locates a central symptom of this fact in Hayless use of the concept of mutation in How We Became Posthuman where mutation is rendered Rutsky writes as a preexisting external force that introduces change into a stable pattern or code and into the material world or body as well But mutation Rutsky points out by definition cannot be seen as external random ness that imposes itself upon the biological or material worldnor for that matter on the realm of culture Rather mutation names that ran domness which is always already immanent in the processes by which both material bodies and cultural patterns replicate themselves16 From this vantage the problem is that there is nothing in Hayless theoretical model of historical progression which is derived from a specific set of humanist conventions and protocols of historiography whose problematic nature Foucault himselfunder the influence of Canguilhem among others17sought to expose that takes this fact into account Moreover her notion of mutation as an external force points as Bruce Clarke has recently put it toward a radical distinc tion between matter and information substance and form one that remains in a realm of dialectical antithesis which observes that the concept of the human has lost its balance andor its foundations and introduction xviii that responds either with lament or delight18 But what is needed here as Rutsky rightly points out is the recognition that any notion of the posthuman that is to be more than merely an extension of the human that is to move beyond the dialectic of control and lack of control superhuman and inhuman must be premised upon a mutation that is ongoing and immanent and this means that to become posthuman means to participate inand find a mode of thought adequate to processes which can never be entirely reduced to patterns or stan dards codes or information19 In this light it is worth recalling Clarkes suggestion that the dia lectical antithesis of matter and information corresponds to the first order cybernetics of midcentury20 while the mutational as Rutsky rightly understands it points toward the necessity of a different logic one consonant as Clarke has pointed out by quoting Gregory Batesons suggestion three decades ago that the whole of logic would have to be reconstructed for recursiveness a logic that is fundamental to the secondorder systems theory that will be articulated in these pages From this perspective I want to underscore what will be a major point of emphasis in this book that systems theory in its secondorder incar nation far from eluding or narratologically mastering the mutational processes just discussed rather subjects itself to themtraces or tracks them as Derrida might say for reasons that will become clear later in just the way Bateson calls for As Dirk Baecker puts it secondorder systems theory may well be read as an attempt to do away with any usual notion of system the theory in a way being the deconstruction of its central term21 Moreover it is also worth remembering Derridas suggestion in his late essay The Animal That Therefore I Am More to Follow that perhaps the deepest logic of his investigation of the question of the animal is in fact viral in the specific sense of a muta tional logic of the trace structure of any notational form any semiotic system that exceeds and encompasses the boundary not just between human and animal but also between the living or organic and the me chanical or technicala contention I take up in some detail in chapters 1 and 222 And it is precisely at this juncture that this book weaves together the two different senses of posthumanism that remained separate in my previous two books Critical Environments and Animal Rites posthumanism as a mode of thought in the first book explored xix introduction there on the parallel terrains of pragmatism systems theory and post structuralism and in the second posthumanism as engaging directly the problem of anthropocentrism and speciesism and how practices of thinking and reading must change in light of their critique It is worth amplifying for a moment the disciplinary institu tional ethical and political stakes of this mutational viral or parasitic form of thinking As David Wills introduction xx travelers in posthumanist thought There is the Lacanian version ar ticulated most recently by Slavoj Žižek according to which the self referential attempts of the domain of the Symbolic to give meaning to or gentrify the domain of the presymbolic Real only generate as a precipitate or remainder of that process the very outside of the Real now understood paradoxically as both pre and postSymbolic they attempt to master24 There is the nearly Zenlike assertion of Gilles Deleuze that I am an empiricist that is a pluralist his at tempt with Félix Guattari to arrive at the magic formula we all seek pluralism  monism by passing through all the dualisms which are the enemy the altogether necessary enemy25 There is Bruno Latours wellknown assertion that we have never been modern his insistence that the fundamental mechanism of modernity creates two entirely distinct ontological zones that of human beings on the one hand that of nonhumans on the other even as it proliferates hybrids of nature and culture26 And there is Foucaults archaeology of humanism to which I have already alluded But the first lesson of both Derrida and Luhmann and in this they go beyond Foucaults genealogical method and beyond dia lectical and historical accounts of the sort we find in Hayles is that Enlightenment rationality is not as it were rational enough because it stops short of applying its own protocols and commitments to itself This is of course the entire point of Derridas deconstruction of many of the major concepts texts and figures in the Western philosophical tradition And it is also the point of Luhmanns attention to the formal dynamics of meaning that arise from the unavoidably paradoxical self reference of any observationa problem that is for him a historical phenomenon created by modernity as a form of functional differen tiation of social systems Long before the historical onset of cyborg technologies that now so obviously inject the post into the posthuman in ways that fascinate the transhumanists functional differentiation itself determines the posthumanist form of meaning reason and com munication by untethering it from its moorings in the individual subjectivity and consciousness Meaning now becomes a specifically modern form of selfreferential recursivity that is used by both psychic systems consciousness and social systems communication to handle overwhelming environmental complexity In this sense Luhmann takes xxi introduction the Kantian commitment to the autonomy of reason seriously but then submits that autonomy to the unavoidable problem of paradoxical self referenceand in that sense he takes reason more seriously than Kant himself did or at least takes it to require a more complex theoretical apparatus because of the increased complexity associated with moder nity as functional differentiation27 As Luhmann puts it in Observations on Modernity The history of European rationality can be described as the history of the dissolution of a rationality continuum that had connected the observer in the world with the world28 To call such a shift historical is not however to fall back into the narrative histo riographic method I and Foucault have just criticized since this new logic itself virally infects or deconstructs if you like any possible his torical accounta fact that paradoxically if you like makes such an account historically representative that is to say in Luhmanns terms it makes it modern29 Thus what Derrida and Luhmann insist on more than any of the thinkers just noted is a thinking that does not turn away from the complexities and paradoxes of selfreferential autopoiesis quite the contrary it finds there precisely the means to articulate what I will call the principle of openness from closure which may itself be seen as the successor to the order from noise principle associated with first order systems theory and inherited by successors such as complexity theory30 Here the emphasis falls as it did not in these earlier theories on the paradoxical fact theorized by both Luhmann and Derrida the very thing that separates us from the world connects us to the world and selfreferential autopoietic closure far from indicating a kind of solipsistic neoKantian idealism actually is generative of openness to the environment As Luhmann succinctly puts it selfreferential closure does not contradict the systems openness to the environment Instead in the selfreferential mode of operation closure is a form of broaden ing possible environmental contacts closure increases by constituting elements more capable of being determined the complexity of the en vironment that is possible for the system31 In Derridas terms The living present springs forth out of its nonidentity with itself and from the possibility of a retentional trace which constitutes the intimate relation of the living present to its outside the opening to exteriority in general32 introduction xxii It is crucial as we shall see in the following chapters that the dynamics described here are not for Luhmann or for Derrida limited to the domain of the human It is thus also in this precise sensethe sense in which the viral logic articulated here must be extended as Derrida insists to the entire field of the living or rather to the lifedeath relation33that the animal question is part of the larger question of posthumanism Indeed for Derrida these dynamics form the basis for deconstructing the various ways in which we have presumed to master or appropriate the finitude we share with nonhuman animals in ways presumably barred to them as in the ability to know the world as such through our possession of language that is barred to animals according to Heidegger It is on the strength of that deconstruction that the question of our ethical relation to animals is opened anew and as it were kept open In this connection my use of Derrida and Luhmann here constitutes an extension and refinement of my deploy ment of the work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela in In the Shadow of Wittgensteins Lion where the emphasis falls on their contention that every act of knowing brings forth world On the one hand they point out that for us as languaging beings every reflec tion including one on the foundation of human knowledge invariably takes place in language which is our distinctive way of being human and being humanly active in the world34 On the other hand language arisesas it does in Luhmanns account of meaning versus language properfrom fundamentally ahuman evolutionary processes of third order structural couplings and recursive coontogenies linked in com plex forms of social behavior and communication among socalled higher animals which have themselves emerged from specific forms of embodiment and neurophysiological organization Indeed as we will see in chapter 1 there are at least three differ ent levels here that must be disarticulated first the selfreferential au topoiesis of a biological systems material substrate its conservation of adaptation through autopoietic closure on the basis of whichand only on the basis of whichit can engage in various forms of structural coupling second the selfreferential formal dynamics of meaning what Maturana and Varela will call in the arena of living systems the emergence of linguistic domains that some but not all autopoietic systems use to reduce environmental complexity and interface with the xxiii introduction world and third the selfreference of language proper as a secondorder phenomenon and a specific medium what Luhmann calls a symboli cally generalized communications medium that is used by some but not all autopoietic systems that use meaning None of these levels is reducible to the others each has its own dynamics its own evolution ary history its own constraints and protocols But this irreducibility far from frustrating our attempts at explanation actually greatly en hances them by necessitating what Maturana calls a nonreductionist relation between the phenomenon to be explained and the mechanism that generates it As Maturana explains the actual result of a process and the operations in the process that give rise to it in a generative rela tion intrinsically take place in independent and nonintersecting phenomenal domains This situation is the reverse of reductionism And this per mits us to see he continues particularly in the domain of biology that there are phenomena like language mind or consciousness that require an interplay of bodies as a generative structure but do not take place in any of them35what we will shortly see Luhmann theorizing in chapter 1 as the difference between consciousness and communica tion psychic systems and social systems which may nevertheless be coupled structurally through media such as language This view has profound implications of course for how we think about the human in relation to the animal about the body and em bodiment To begin with it means that we can no longer talk of the body or even for that matter of a body in the traditional sense We take for granted in other words Bruno Latours assertion that the human form is as unknown to us as the nonhuman    It is better to speak of xmorphism instead of becoming indignant when humans are treated as nonhumans or vice versa36 Rather the body is now seen as a kind of virtuality but one that is precisely for that reason all the more real If we believe as I think we must the contention that neurophysiologically different autopoietic lifeforms bring forth a world in what Maturana and Varela call their embodied enaction and if in doing so the environment is thus different indeed sometimes radically different for different lifeformsthen the environment and with it the body becomes unavoidably a virtual multidimensional space produced and stabilized by the recursive enactions and struc tural couplings of autopoietic beings who share what Maturana and introduction xxiv Varela call a consensual domain First there is noise multiplicity complexity and the heterogeneity of the environment of what is I put first in quotation marks to underscore the fact that such a statement could only arise after all as the observation of an autopoietic system hence first here also means because of the inescapable fact of the selfreference of such an observation last it is the environment of the system not nature or any other given anteriority37 Second there are the autopoietic systems that if they are to continue their existence respond to this overwhelming complexity by reducing it in terms of the selectivity of a selfreferential selectivity or code and this means third that the world is an ongoing differentiated construction and creation of a shared environment sometimes converging in a consen sual domain sometimes not by autopoietic entities that have their own temporalities chronicities perceptual modalities and so on in short their own forms of embodiment Fourth the world is thus a virtuality and a multiplicity it is both what one does in embodied enaction and what the selfreference of that enaction excludes Again Luhmann Reality is what one does not perceive when one perceives it Crucially then virtual does not mean not real on the con trary given the openness from closure principle the more virtual the world is the more real it is because the buildup of internal complexity made possible by autopoietic closure actually increases the complexity of the environment that is possible for any system In that sense it in creases the systems connection and sensitivity to and dependence on the environment Rethinking embodiment in this way one might be tempted to invoke Deleuze and Guattaris wellknown idea of the body without organs along the lines usefully glossed by Brian Massumi Since the body is an open system an infolding of impulses from an aleatory out side all its potential singular states are determined by a fractal attrac tor Call that strange attractor the bodys plane of consistency It is a subset of the worlds plane of consistency a segment of its infinite frac tal attractor It is the body as pure potential pure virtuality38 But taking seriously the concept of autopoiesisthat systems including bodies are both open and closed as the very condition of possibility for their exis tence open on the level of structure to energy flows environmental per turbations and the like but closed on the level of selfreferential organi xxv introduction zation as Maturana and Varela put it and taking seriously Maturanas assertion that a description in language and the generative phenomena to be described take place in independent and nonintersecting phe nomenal domains there can be no talk of the bodys plane of consis tency being a subset of the worlds plane of consistency And there can be no talk of purity Everything we know scientifically theoretically and say linguistically or in other forms of semiotic notation about the body takes place within some contingent radically nonnatural that is constructed and technical schema of knowledge The language or meaning more strictly speaking that describes is of a different phe nomenal order from that which is described Paradoxically that lan guage is fundamental to our embodied enaction our bringing forth a world as humans And yet it is dead Rather as Derrida puts it quite precisely it exceeds and encompasses the lifedeath relation That fact doesnt prevent in the least its effectivity since effectivity as Latour among others has shown is not a matter of philosophical or theoreti cal representationalism39 To return then to the question of posthumanism the perspec tive I attempt to formulate herefar from surpassing or rejecting the humanactually enables us to describe the human and its character istic modes of communication interaction meaning social significa tions and affective investments with greater specificity once we have removed meaning from the ontologically closed domain of conscious ness reason reflection and so on It forces us to rethink our takenfor granted modes of human experience including the normal perceptual modes and affective states of Homo sapiens itself by recontextualizing them in terms of the entire sensorium of other living beings and their own autopoietic ways of bringing forth a worldways that are since we ourselves are human animals part of the evolutionary history and behavioral and psychological repertoire of the human itself But it also insists that we attend to the specificity of the humanits ways of being in the world its ways of knowing observing and describingby paradoxically for humanism acknowledging that it is fundamentally a prosthetic creature that has coevolved with various forms of tech nicity and materiality forms that are radically nothuman and yet have nevertheless made the human what it is For Derrida of course this includes the most fundamental prostheticity of all language in the introduction xxvi broadest sense As I have already noted this prostheticity this consti tutive dependency and finitude has profound ethical implications for our relations to nonhuman forms of lifea point I will discuss in some detail in the first half of the book40 It also changes how we think about normal human experience and how that experience gets refracted or queried in specific modes and media of artistic and cultural practice that form the focus of the books second part The theoretical approaches I have been sketching here will be developed in greater detail in chapter 1 which attempts a sort of cross articulation of the theoretical approaches of Jacques Derrida and Niklas Luhmann not least to provide a context for a lesskneejerk response for Luhmanns work than it has been accustomed to thus far in the United States Here apropos David Willss earlier observation about the selfassurance of any hegemonic discourse or practice it is worth mentioning that the situation is quite different outside the United States especially in Europe where systems theory is widely dissemi nated and influential in academic and intellectual life A central con tention here will be that the similarities between systems theory and deconstruction have been hard to see because both converge on their central concept of difference from opposite directions While Derridas work begins by confronting a logocentric philosophical tradition in which difference must be released in its immanence through the work of deconstruction for Luhmann difference names an evolutionary and adaptive problemspecifically the fact of overwhelming envi ronmental complexitythat any system must find a way of address ing if it wants to continue its autopoiesis Against this background Derrida and Luhmann emerge as exemplary posthumanist theorists I argue because both refuse to locate meaning in the realm of either the human or for that matter the biological Moreover both insist on the crucial disarticulation of what Luhmann calls psychic systems and social systems consciousness and communication in ways famously insisted on in Derridas early critique of the selfpresence of speech and autoaffection of the voice For both the form of meaning is the true substrate of the coevolution of psychic systems and social systems and this means that the human is at its core and in its very constitution radically ahuman and constitutively prosthetic Chapter 2 moves this question of meaningits form its evolution xxvii introduction into two additional contexts that will be important for the book as a whole the question of animal intelligence and communication and the question of disciplinarity A central argument of this chapter is that Derridas theory of language in the broadest sense akin to Luhmanns meaning and its relationship to questions of subjectivity intentional ity and the like help us see how philosophers of cognitive science such as Daniel Dennett remain within the very Cartesianism they are trying to escape Because of their reliance on an essentially representational ist theory of language that many trained in the humanities would find dubious at best CogSci figures such as Dennett not only reinscribe the Cartesian subject that their functionalism wants to critique but also reinstate the ontological difference between humans and animals familiar to us from the philosophical traditiona difference that turns out to have dire ethical consequences in Dennetts work Just how dif ficult that Cartesianism is to escape is revealed in Derridas analysis of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacans rendering of the humananimal divide in light of his theory of the subject of the signifiera theory that shares more with the Cartesianism of Dennetts analytic approach on this question than one might have expected Chapter 3the longest and most ambitious in the bookexplores in much greater detail the relationship between different philosophi cal approaches and the ethical consequences attendant on those dif ferences for thinking our relations with nonhuman animals discussed in the previous chapter I begin by casting a hard look at the more familiar and institutionally powerful forms of bioethics which emerge in this discussion as less an ethics per se than a branch of policy stud ies within the historical development of what Foucault calls biopower and governmentality With regard to the specific ethical question I focus on here the standing of nonhuman animals bioethics takes for granted the underlying moral hierarchy of humananimal that it ought to be committed to questioning We need to look elsewhere I suggest for more searching engagements with this problem and I begin by examining briefly Martha Nussbaums recent attempt in Frontiers of Justice to apply an Aristotelian capabilities approach focused on the flourishing of particular species to the question of justice and spe cies difference Despite its admirable focus on vulnerability finitude and embodiment as crucial dimensions of ethical thought Nussbaums introduction xxviii work is hampered by numerous problems not the least of which is its odd combination of analytic imprecision and programmatic insistence so I turn to the philosopher Cora Diamonds remarkable body of work on this problem which is interested not just in the question of ethics and animals but also in how confronting that question changes how we think about what justice is and what philosophy itself may be Under the influence of Stanley Cavells work on philosophical skepticism Diamond asks us not to mistake the difficulty of philoso phy a propositional ifPthenQ kind of difficulty for the difficulty of reality which she finds on display in the novelist J M Coetzees character Elizabeth Costello in The Lives of Animals who is wounded and haunted by the animal holocaust going on around us daily in practices such as factory farming Diamonds searching and original analysis points us toward a fact that will I argue require Derridas work to fully articulate that we share with nonhuman animals not just one form of finitude but two not just the radical passivity and vul nerability announced in Jeremy Benthams famous assertion that the question is not can they talk or can they reason but can they suf fer but also the kind of finitude articulated by Derrida in his critique of Lacan That second form of finitude derives from the fundamental exteriority and materiality of meaning and communication itself of any form of semiotic marking and iterability to which both humans and nonhuman animals are subject in a trace structure that as he puts it exceeds and encompasses the humananimal difference and indeed the lifedeath relation itself For this reason we cannot master and erase in any analytic of finitude or existential of beingtowarddeath as in Heidegger our radical passivity in a way that would once again separate us definitively and ontologically from nonhuman animals Chapter 4 attempts to intervene at a crucial moment in the de velopment of what has recently come to be called animal studies by engaging with the question of disciplinarity In doing so it revisits and formalizes the questions of disciplinarity namely what is philosophy that animated the previous chapter but it explores that question on the terrain of current US literary and cultural studies and their ruling dis ciplinary norms which are at the current moment historicist They are historicist of a particular variety as it turns out one that takes for granted and reproduces a specific picture of the knowing subject xxix introduction that undercuts the putative historicist commitment to the material ity heterogeneity and externality of historical forces a subject that is clearly to put it in the terms of a Marxist historicism largely evacuated or at least domesticated in current literary and cultural studies an ideo logical expression of liberalism It is on this level I argue that the real force of animal studies is occluded and compromised by many of the assumptions and practices that are mobilized by the template on which it is modeled namely cultural studies Rather the full force of animal studieswhat makes it not just another flavor of fill in the blank stud ies on the model of media studies film studies womens studies ethnic studies and so onis that it fundamentally unsettles and reconfigures the question of the knowing subject and the disciplinary paradigms and procedures that take for granted its form and reproduce it To put it an other way there are humanist ways and there are posthumanist ways of engaging in this supposedly always already posthumanist pursuit called animal studies It is hereand not in the simple fact that various disciplines have recently converged on an object of study called the animalthat the deepest challenge to the disciplines posed by animal studies may be felt Chapter 5 broadens this question of posthumanist studies to in clude disability studies as well and revisits the relationship between language subjectivity and phenomenology explored in chapter 2 Here I focus on the fascinating figure of Temple Grandin perhaps the best known representative of an emergent area of contemporary US culture in which animal studies and disability studies converge Both disability studies and animal studies are interested in rethinking from the ground up as it were questions of subjectivity bodily experience mental life intersubjectivity and the ethical and even political changes attendant on reopening those questions in light of new knowledge about the life experiences of nonhuman animals and those who are called problem atically no doubt the disabled In Grandins case she insists that her specific condition a form of autism known as Aspergers syndrome enables her to understand more deeply how nonhuman animals such as cows perceive and experience the world and she has integrated that understanding she claims into her designs for animal holding facilities throughout North America I am interested here in how Grandins case helps us radically denaturalize many of the takenforgranted modes introduction xxx of human perception and mentation of normatesnot least visual experience and an entire set of assumptions about the relationship be tween language and thought that I have examined in earlier chapters I am also interested as I end this chapter in Grandins insistence that disability becomes an important form of abledness in opening up trans species modes of identification and thus helps us to disclose how we need to rethink the underlying models of subjectivity that ground the dominant discourses in disability studies drawn as they are from the liberal democratic framework and its casting of subjectivity in terms of agency autonomy and the like The second half of the book does not by any means abandon the theoretical and ethical frames that occupy part I rather part II contin ues to develop them but on different terrain by engaging in detailed readings and interpretations of a range of cultural and artistic prac tices that exemplify a posthumanist sensibility or problematic as they emerge and are worked through in particular media and art forms Chapter 6 continues to excavate the question of visuality in relation to the problem of humanism but does so by linking it to an overt the matics of nonhuman life and the question of its ethical standing that dominates the work of two very different and important contempo rary artists Eduardo Kac and Sue Coe What I am interested in here to put it schematically is the following question What is the relationship if indeed there is one between representationalism and speciesism What is the connection between an artistic mode or medium and the ways of seeing and experiencing the world that they take for granted and how do those index a certain kind of perceiving experiencing sub ject By using the work of Michael Fried and Derrida to read Sue Coes enormous and compelling project Dead Meata compilation of draw ings paintings and sketches based on her visits to slaughterhouses in the United States and abroadI try to show how art that is dedicated to exposing the horrors of anthropocentrism and the violence toward animals that it countenances may nevertheless be in its very strategies and despite itself humanist and anthropocentric On the other hand art such as Eduardo Kacs which is controversial in part because of its collaboration with genetic engineers as in his most famous work GFP Bunny which produced a glowinthedark rabbit named Alba may nevertheless engage in a fundamentally posthumanist project in its xxxi introduction deft deployment and exposure of certain habits of visuality and rep resentationalism associated as W J T Mitchell and Luhmann argue with the spectatorsubject of humanismhabits that Kacs choice of medium and method is calculated to unsettle Chapter 7 continues the investigation of the relationship between visuality and posthumanism on the terrain of photography and film but adds to it the relationship between sound and voice specifically in Lars von Triers brilliant and to some infuriating film Dancer in the Dark Drawing on work by Stanley Cavell Catherine Clément Kaja Silverman Judith Butler Slavoj Žižek Derrida and others I attempt to draw out the ethical stakes of how the film stages a certain drama of prosthetic subjectivity and of what Žižek calls the act as feminine in the story of the main character Selma played brilliantly by the pop phe nom Björka story that begins with her impending blindness and ends with her hanging for the crime of murder In the process I try to dem onstrate how both Cavells skepticism and Žižeks psychoanalysis bril liant as they are in their local insights remain fundamentally within the purview of a humanism that von Triers film both mobilizes as fantasy and throws into question in its filmic practice As Luhmann might put it Dancer in the Darks relationship to posthumanism is not just thematic in the relationship between Selmas encroaching blindness and how it reconfigures the sightsound relationship for the human but also op erational in its handling of the medium of film itself Luhmanns work is especially apt for framing our understanding of the architectural projects discussed in chapter 8 because many of them selfconsciously mobilize the discourse of emergence autopoiesis and selforganizing systems that has become an increasingly central feature in landscape architecture in particular That discourse asks us to reconceive the relationship between nature and culture as a sys temenvironment relationship in which neither term is given as such and both are a product of cospecification as they emerge from specific practices of articulation Among the distinguished group of finalists for Torontos Downsview Park competition the winning entry Tree City by Rem Koolhaas and Bruce Mau is remarkable for its bold re fusal of the realm officially known as architecture there are no built structures in the project and its antirepresentationalist attempt to dis place the compositional logic endemic to the problem of the urban introduction xxxii parka logic that is after all quite at odds with the conceptual thrust of selforganizing systems and autopoiesis invoked by all the entries To accomplish its task Tree City engages in a kind of dematerialization of the architectural medium in which time not spaceand certainly not built spacebecomes the constitutive medium A similar logic of dematerialization is at work in Diller  Scofidios Blur projecta manufactured cloud hovering over a lakeand it is one that raises fundamental questions of form and meaning in art that Luhmanns work will help us answer namely how in the medium of architec ture no less can the weakening even the refusal of form in the tra ditional sense constitute precisely a works boldest formal statement To answer that question we need to understand that art as a social system has a unique relationship to the difference between perception and communication discussed in our opening chapter The work of art Luhmann argues copresents that difference and reenters it in service of its own construction of meaning integrating what is in principle incommunicablenamely perceptioninto the communi cation network of society41 This is what allows art to have a privileged relationship to what has traditionally been called the ineffable and the sublime That paradoxical observability of the unobservable the commu nicability of the incommunicablethe fact that as Luhmann puts it the activity of distinguishing and indicating that goes on in the world conceals the world42ought to sound familiar to students of romanti cism and in particular to students of Stanley Cavells reading of philo sophical skepticism as a framework for understanding the subject of chapter 9 Ralph Waldo Emerson For Cavell skepticism names the problem deriving canonically from Kants encounter with the Ding an sich of the evanescence and lubricity of all objects as Emerson puts it which lets them slip through our fingers when we clutch hardest To Cavells brilliant rereading of Emerson I want to add Luhmanns reading of romanticism as a reaction to modernity as a phenomenon of functional differentiation because it helps us see that Emerson more than any other philosopher of his day or one might argue of any day puts particular pressure on the paradoxical dynamics of ob servation as theorized by Luhmann as in Emersons proclamation in Nature of 1836 I am nothing I see all Cavells reading of Emerson xxxiii introduction in light of philosophical skepticism thus inaugurates a project that we will need Luhmanns systems theory to complete If Cavell helps us to understand how Emerson reinvents philosophy by continuing to do philosophy after philosophy is in a very real sense impossible then Luhmann helps us articulate more precisely how that task must be come a posthumanist one how it is precisely at his most paradoxical and illogical that Emerson is at his most systematic and rigorous in obeying a quite different logic a logic inaugurated by modernity as functional differentiation and its unavoidable epistemological fallout Emersons especially rigorous form of romanticism and his en gagement of the problem of observation as theorized by Luhmann form an invaluable background for chapter 10 which engages the work of the twentiethcentury poet perhaps most associated with the Emersonian legacy Wallace Stevens Here however I am less con cerned with an authorial study than with extending Luhmanns inves tigations of the problems of form and meaning encountered in the pre vious two chapters into the realm of poetic form specifically As with my reading of Emerson my aim here is to show that Luhmanns theory of art in relation to the paradoxical dynamics of observation provides us with the tools to move beyond the critical impasses that have char acterized vague discussions of Stevenss romantic modernism Like Emersons philosophy Stevenss poetry insists on our not turning away from paradoxical selfreference it both calls for an encounter with things exactly as they are and proclaims that what I saw  Or heard or felt came not but from myself43 It is not just in paradox but in the systematicity with which it is deployed that we may identify the rigor of Stevenss poetry Far from a nonserious or imaginative engage ment of the problem Stevenss work uses form in Luhmanns sense to stage and more importantly to make productive the central paradox of meaning after the turn to functional differentiation that selfreference mind imagination or spirit in the thematics of romanticism and hetero reference reality world nature are themselves both products of self reference Luhmanns work helps us to see that this is not however simply an updated form of philosophical idealism of the sort derived from Kant It also helps us understand a fact we encountered in chap ter 8 that form does not involve the material or perceptual substrate of the artwork here in the conspicuous absence in much of Stevenss introduction xxxiv poetry of the prosodic features typically associated with poetic form but is rather a matter of the recursive selfreference of arts communi cation what Luhmann calls arts overcoming of its own contingency Form is not that is the externalization of a subjective interiority or a consciousness and it is in that precise sense posthumanist In the final chapter I return to questions that animate the middle part of the bookquestions of sound voice music and visuality I re visit the work of Jacques Derrida to parse the relationship between analog and digital media on the site of David Byrne and Brian Enos collaboration both musical and artistic around their remarkable re cord My Life in the Bush of Ghosts 1981 The uncanny effect of that record on almost everyone who hears it in my experience has to do in no small part with its use of found vocal materials drawn from a range of I THEORIES DISCIPLINES ETHICS This page intentionally left blank Meaning and Event or Systems Theory and The Reconstruction of Deconstruction As I said humans cant communicate niklas luhmann How Can the Mind Participate in Communication The reception of systems theory in the United Statesand in North America generallyover the past decade and more has been vexatious at best In a professional academic landscape in which most critics and theorists pride themselves on moving easily and syncreti cally between theoretical approaches that at an earlier moment were thought of more as warring factions systems theory remains odd man out When it is understood at all it is routinely greeted with re actions ranging from suspicion to outright anger Critics who think of their work rightly or wrongly as a component of a broader politi cal projectat least in the last instance to borrow Louis Althussers wellknown caveatoften view systems theory as just a grim techno cratic functionalism or a thinly disguised apology for the status quo a kind of barely camouflaged social Darwinism In this view systems theoryin either its firstorder Norbert Wiener version or its second order Niklas Luhmann retoolinggets assimilated to the larger context of postWorld War II societys obsession with management commandandcontrol apparatuses informatic reproduction homeo stasis and the like rightly criticized by theorists like Donna Haraway in her important essay The Biological Enterprise Sex Mind and Profit from Human Engineering to Sociobiology1 Systems theory in stead of being invited to the party reserved for chaos and complexity theory and their interest in the unpredictability creativity and emer gence of complex nonlinear dynamics ends up dancing with Richard Dawkinss The Selfish Gene Still others level more general charges meaning and event familiar from the shopworn discourse of antitheory and lament sys tems theorys excessive abstraction its lack of attention to social and historical texture and its blind ambition to assimilate everything in its purview as grist for its universalizing mill If these charges sound familiar they ought to because they are an uncanny echo of the sorts of things that we all remember being said about deconstruction and specifically about the work of Jacques Derrida when it came ashore in North America in the 1970s Derridas Speech and Phenomena appeared in translation in 1973 followed in rapid succession by Of Grammatology in English in 1976 and Writing and Difference in 1978 Of course we all got over it and the irony need hardly be remarked but Ill remark it anyway that it is difficult to find anyone who has had much success in the profession of literary and cultural studies in North America who did not cut his or her teeth on just these texts and whose deployment of lessons learned from them in his or her own work is not more or less automatic and unconscious though that has changed some over the past decade with the hege mony of certain modes of historicism in which the antitheory compo nent is especially virulenta question I will revisit in some detail in chapter 4 The reasons for system theorys chilly reception in the United States are complicated and Im not going to investigate them in any detail here but Ill at least offer a couple of brief speculations One set of reasons not to be underestimated is disciplinary and institutional First as many of us remember deconstruction in Americaa time capsule phrase if ever there was onemade its way into universities mainly via comparative literature departments and if you think that was a precarious foothold consider that the major practitioner of sys tems theory Luhmann has entered the US academy primarily by way of German departments or their equivalent fractions in larger compara tive literature and language departments mainly under the rubric of German intellectual history Here the work of scholars such as David Wellbery William Rasch and Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht is exemplary But over the past decade many American universities have downsized or eliminated their German departments and it is hard for me to think of any more endangered place to be in the humanities in the United States over the past ten years with the possible exception of classics Related to this question of institutional foothold is another dif ferent deficit the absence of a nationally disseminated journal that is tethered to the theoretical model Diacritics published out of the Comparative Literature Department at Cornell University became something like the house journal for deconstruction in the 1970s and 1980s but the Stanford Literature Review which has done more than any single US journal to consistently publish work in systems theory is not Diacritics A few special issues of other wellknown journals have been devoted to systems theory and Luhmanns workTheory Culture and Society published by Sage in Great Britain though widely available in the United States MLN New German Critique and one and a half issues of Cultural Critique titled The Politics of Systems and Environmentsbut nothing that has the kind of ongoing rela tionship to systems theory that Representations did and does for New Historicism Moreover systems theory has had to brook an even greater degree of disciplinary dissonance where the establishing texts of deconstruction were quite identifiably within the purview of phi losophy and often of literature the major texts and figures of systems theory enter the humanities through the side door of science either social science and sociology with Luhmann or the life sciences in the case of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela or the inter face of firstorder cybernetic computer science with neurology in the case of Heinz von Foerster Finally there is the daunting difficulty of the theory itself whichparticularly in Luhmanns handsgives even seasoned readers of theory pause with its extraordinary abstrac tion and rigor its headon engagement with problems of paradox self reference and the like its systematically counterintuitive findings and its relative lack of creature comforts along the way for those who have signed on for the journey of what Luhmann unabashedly calls supertheory Of course here again we should probably remind our selves that it is hard to recall a major theoretical development about which something similar was not said and some of our colleagues are old enough to remember similar complaints about the technical rigor and coldbloodedness of that strange alienating scientistic approach to literary texts called gasp the New Criticism Other speculations could no doubt be offered about why systems theory in the United States has not emerged as the kind of factor in meaning and event cultural studies that it is most obviously in Germany but my main point is not to analyze those reasons further Rather it is to nudge the reception of systems theory in a different direction by strategi cally bringing out some of its more deconstructive characteristics2 Indeed I hope to make clear to skeptics that much of what they like about deconstruction is also much of what they should like about sys tems theory because systems theory in its contemporary articulation far from conforming to the stereotypes prepared for it in the US academymay well be read to borrow Dirk Baeckers formulation as an attempt to do away with any usual notion of system the theory in a way being the deconstruction of its central term3 To take only one example let us revisit the epigraph with which I began On the one hand the dominant hand Luhmanns conten tion that humans cant communicate seems not just counterintuitive but flatly wrong in fact as a colleague mentioned to me recently at a conference it seems insulting And yet as I hope will be clear by the end of my comments here Luhmanns remark rhetorically calculated no doubt to cause just such a stir makes essentially the same point about the difference between consciousness and communication that we have quite readily accepted for decades now as gospel from Derrida namely his deconstruction of the autoaffection of the voice aspresence and of the valorizing of speech as an index of the self presence of consciousness to itself  over writing a recursive domain of iterative communication that is properly understood fundamen tally ahuman or even antihuman I will return to the ethical implica tions around this question of the metaphysical voice in chapter 6 Similarly I will explore in more detail in the next chapter Derridas insistence that it is just this sort of radical separation of what Luhmann calls psychic and social systems that will lead him to reject the notion of the signifier as in Lacans formulation of the subject of the signifier which seems at first glance quite cognate to Luhmanns formulation in favor of the articulation of writing as fundamentally a structured dynamics of the trace Equally important for my purposes in this book as we will see in the next three chapters is that this trace structure of communication extends beyond the human to nonhuman animals and indeed exceeds as we are about to see the boundary between the liv ing and the mechanical or technical come as no surprise because Derrida himself announces the conver gence in his own terms in early formative texts such as Of Gramma tology whose first chapter The End of the Book and the Beginning of Writing begins with a section entitled The Program There Derrida argues that the entire field covered by the cybernetic program will be the field of writing but writing understood in terms of the grammè or the grapheme a writing that would name as its fundamental unit an element without simplicitywhich is to say an element of irre ducible complexity specifically as systems theory uses the term And a temporalized complexity at that for as Derrida writes cybernetics is itself intelligible only in terms of a history of the possibilities of the trace as the unity of a double movement of protention and retention4 Derridas claim put forth as it was in the late 1960s may seem even now a radical one but in fact it was lodged against the back drop of an entire revolution in the sciences that had already taken such models as axiomatic In fact the first chapter of the 1965 Nobel Prize winner Francois Jacobs remarkably influential The Logic of Life is also called The Programme There Jacob reminds us that hered ity is described today in terms of information messages and code What this meansand this is clearly related to Derridas early work on both Husserl and Saussureis that the intention of a psyche has been replaced by the translation of a message The living being does indeed represent the execution of a plan but not one conceived in any mind5 Derrida would add to this however the point he presses in Of Grammatology If the theory of cybernetics is by itself to oust all metaphysical conceptsincluding the concepts of soul of life of value of choice of memorywhich until recently served to separate the machine from man it must conserve the notion of writing trace grammè written mark or grapheme until its own historicometaphysical character is exposed6 As an example of such character interestingly enough Derrida cites in a footnote not Jacob but the firstgeneration systems theorist Norbert Wiener who while abandoning semantics and the opposition judged by him as too crude and too general between animate and inanimate meaning and event etc nevertheless continues to use expressions like organs of sense motor organs etc to qualify the parts of the machine 324n3 Part of what I will be arguing in what follows is that Luhmanns handling of systems theory accomplishes just the sort of conservation of the logic of the grammè that Derrida calls for a conservation that is crucial to any posthumanism whatsoevernot only because the movement of the programasgrammè goes far beyond the possibilities of the in tentional consciousness as the source and guarantor of meaning but also because once the notion of the program is invoked one no longer has recourse to the concepts that habitually serve to distinguish man from other living beings instinct and intelligence absence or presence of speech of society of economy etc etc 84 As I have suggested elsewhere this crosstalk between postwar science and what would come to be called theory is not limited to Derrida and Wiener Indeed perhaps the most profound backstory of all in contemporary thought is the ongoing if episodic influence of such new scientific discourses on thinkers who would emerge in the 1950s and 1960s to redefine the very landscape of the humanities and social sciences think here of Foucaults interest in Jacob and Canguilhem Lacans in cybernetics Lyotards in chaos and catastrophe theory and so on7 My aim at the moment however is not to make that histori cal argument Nor is it just to play up the deconstructive aspects of systems theory nor even to suggest as I have been that the largely kneejerk reactions to systems theory in the United States have been misplaced or at least visàvis the reception of deconstruction rather ungenerously placed Rather my emphasis here will on the usefulness of viewing secondorder systems theory as to use Luhmanns characterization the reconstruction of deconstruction8 That project hinges on sys tems theorys extraordinarily rigorous and detailed account of the fundamental dynamics and complexities of meaning that subtend the reproduction and interpenetration of psychic and social systems And systems theory then takes the additional step of linking those dynam ics to their biological social and historical conditions of emergence and transformation a crucial move that as Gunther Teubner has ar gued deconstruction either cannot or will not undertake It is certainly the case that Derridas later work has been intensely and increasingly engaged with the question of social institutions in all their formsthe law the university the question of rights the institution of property and so onand the logics that ground and sustain their reproduction But though he has raised such questionsworried them might be a bet ter termwith a degree of nuance and suppleness perhaps unmatched in contemporary theory and philosophy Derrida has not been espe cially interested in articulating the relationship between the theoreti cal complexities of those dynamics and the historical and sociological conditions of their emergenceconditions that he suggests impel such thinking at this very moment9 Whether this is a failure or a prin cipled refusal on Derridas part is an interesting question and it is one I will return to later in this chapter One could cite any number of Derridas texts in this connection but the recent collection of essays Without Alibi exemplifies quite well what I mean There Derrida considers the question of what he calls a politics of the virtual of a certain delocalizing virtualization of the space of communication discussion publication archivization against the backdrop of this larger question Will we one day be able and in a single gesture to join the thinking of the event to the think ing of the machine10 Today he continues they appear to us to be antinomic    An event worthy of the name ought not so we think to give in or be reduced to repetition but rather ought above all to happen to someone some living being who is thus affected by it The machine on the contrary is destined to reproduce impassively im perceptibly without organ or organicity received commands it obeys a calculable program without affect or autoaffection 72 If we are to address the sorts of questions raised here Derrida argues now is the time for a new kind of thinking How he asks is one to reconcile on the one hand a thinking of the event which I pro pose withdrawing despite the apparent paradox from an ontology or a metaphysics of presence    and on the other hand a certain concept of machineness machinalité 136 This he rightly observes is the place of a thinking that ought to be devoted to the virtualization of the event by the machine to a virtuality that in exceeding the philosophi cal determination of the possibility of the possible    exceeds by the same token the classical opposition of the possible and the impossible 135 If one day he continues with one and the same concept these meaning and event two incompatible concepts the event and the machine were to be thought together you can bet that not only    will one have produced a new logic an unheardof conceptual form In truth against the back ground and horizon of our present possibilities this new figure would resemble a monster 73 It would be in a word posthumanist What I want to suggest of course is that systems theory in its secondorder incarnation is just such a monster one whose corner stone genetic mutation is the transfer of the concept of autopoiesis from organicity to the domain of not only psychic but also social systems systems whose fundamental elements are not people or groups but com munications and eventsand events conceptualized along the lines Derrida lays out in the previous paragraph We have already used de construction to help clarify a central point from systems theorythe separation of psychic and social systemsbut here we can return the favor and use systems theory to clarify how the thinking of the event may be in Derridas words withdrawn from an ontology or meta physics of presence11 On the one hand events constitute the fundamen tal elements of psychic and social systems in Luhmanns scheme On the other hand they occur only once and only in the briefest period nec essary for their appearance the specious present They are identified by this temporal appearance and cannot be repeated12 But precisely this suits them to be the elementary units of processes because the system itself determines the length of time during which an element is treated as a unity that cannot be further dissolved that period has a conferred not an ontological character 48 An elements unity corre sponds to no unity in the substrate it is created by the system that uses them through their connectivity 215 accordingly Luhmann con tinues an adequately stable system is composed of unstable elements It owes its stability to itself not to its elements its constructs itself upon a foundation that is entirely not there and this is precisely the sense in which it is autopoietic 48 And here as much as anywhere we get a specific sense of how systems theory thinks Derridas event and machine all at once as a deconstructive enfolding of the difference between the systems iterative selfreference and the fleeting temporality of the event from the outsidea difference that not only serves as the very basis for the systems autopoiesis but also clarifies the fact as Dietrich Schwanitz puts it that systems theory is anything but mechanistic13 As for Derridas partyou will have already guessed by my use of the term iterative a moment agowe know what his version of this monstrosity of the eventmachine looks like it looks like écriture archéwriting as différance as grammè and as trace For our purposes it is all the more interesting then that in contrast to his notion of writing Derrida has interrogated the concept of communication in a variety of contexts and nowhere more forcefully perhaps than in his essay Signature Event Context and its related documents collected in Limited Inc There he argues that his concept of writing can no longer be comprehensible in terms of communication at least in the limited sense of a transmission of meaning Inversely it is within the general domain of writing defined in this way that the effects of semantic communication can be determined as effects that are particular sec ondary inscribed and supplementary14 The full resonance of this last assertion in relation to the dynam ics of meaning in systems theory will become clear in a moment but for now we need to note as well that the difference between writing in Derridas sense and communication as he defines it is marked by radi cally different relations to the question of the subjectand here indeed we encounter from the point of view of humanism part of its mon strosity As Derrida writes Imagine a writing whose code would be so idiomatic as to be established and known as a secret cipher by only two subjectsand subjects here is given in quotation marks Could we maintain that following the death of the receiver or even of both partners the mark left by one of them is still a writing Yes to the extent to that organized by a code even an unknown and non linguistic one it is constituted in its identity as a mark by its iterability in the absence of such and such a person and hence ultimately of every empirically determined subject    The possibility of repeating and thus of identifying the marks is implicit in every code making it into a network une grille that is communicable transmittable decipherable iterable for a third and hence for every possible user in general To be what it is all writing must therefore be capable of functioning in the radical absence of every empirically determined receiver in general15 Herein lies the radically posthumanist dimension of writingas difference the subjectin a process nearly proverbial for contempo rary thought from Derrida to Lacanonly comes to be by conforming meaning and event to a strictly diacritical system of differences effects which do not find their cause in a subject or a substance in a thing in general a being that is somewhere present thereby eluding the play of difference16 Moreover those effects and relations are at once material bodily ex ternal institutional technological and historicalthey exist in all the specificity and heterogeneity of what Derrida calls their iteration Hence Derrida argues that this pure difference which constitutes the selfpresence of the living present introduces into selfpresence from the beginning all the impurity putatively excluded from it The living present springs forth out of its nonidentity with itself and from the possibility of a retentional trace It is always already a trace And what this means in turn is that the trace is the intimate relation of the liv ing present to its outside the opening to exteriority in general17 From the point of view of the philosophical tradition that Derrida is concerned to deconstruct such will be the corrupting and con taminating work the monstrosity if you will of iterability which entails the necessity of thinking at once both the rule and the event concept and singularity as such it marks the essential and ideal limit of all pure idealization not as the concept of nonideality as ideal itys pure other but as the impossibility or at the least the provisional ity of idealization as such18 Like the undecidability that it unavoid ably generatesand this will lead us to the final question we want to raiseiterability remains heterogeneous to rather than simply op posed to the order of the ideal the calculable the pure and so on As such it names a form of ethical responsibility that entails vigilant attention to each specific interfolded iteration of rule and event to this particular undecidable that opens the field of decision or decid ability 116 one that is always a determinate oscillation between pos sibilities that takes place in strictly defined situations for example discursivesyntactical or rhetoricalbut also political ethical etc They are pragmatically determined 148 Exactly what the force and scope of this last assertionprag matically determined and in strictly defined situationsare for Derrida is a question that goes directly to Teubners concerns already touched on earlier and it is one to which I will return later in this chapter and the book particularly in chapter 3 For now however I simply want to make the point that this picture of writing in the Derridean sense and the restructuring of the question of the subject that it pulls in its wake does not mark a difference between Derridas écriture and the concept of communication in systems theory rather it is precisely what illuminates their convergence When Derrida uses the term communication in Limited Inc what he really has in mind is the model of communication mobilized by firstgeneration systems theory That model like the speech act theory of Austin deconstructed in Limited Inc seems but only seems as it turns out to rightly refer the question of meaning to its external formal dynamics rather than to ontology intentionality and so on Of course it is this very bag gage attached to the term communication that Luhmanns work like Derridas is dead set on rejecting In fact Communication and Action the chapter in Social Systems that makes this clearest explic itly meaning and event that are already ensconced in textual and institutional form and then asks how the subversion of those structures by their own elements can be revealed21 For Derrida contingency temporality the event noise and so on constitute the eruptive and finally irrepressible difference at the heart of any logos or law a difference whose unavoidability and un masterability deconstruction aims to bring to light and sustain For systems theory however this radical heterogeneity is handled within an adaptive and operational framework as a fundamental evolution ary problem for autopoietic systems that have to reproduce themselves in the face of this overwhelming difference22 Because of this reversal of orientation the descriptions offered by systems theory autopoietic systems that can reduce environmental difference and complexity will continue to exist have been misunderstood as prescriptions such sys tems should exist and difference and complexity are negative values But of course systems theory doesnt desire the reduction of differ ence and complexity indeed Luhmann would be the first to insist that such would constitute a category mistake if ever there was one it only describes how difference and complexity have to be handled by sys tems that hope to continue their autopoiesis Systems theory in other words does not occlude deny or other wise devalue difference but rather begins with differencenamely the cornerstone postulate of the difference between system and envi ronment and the corollary assumption that the environment of any system is always already of overwhelmingly greater complexity than the system itself Since it is obviously impossible for any system to es tablish pointforpoint correspondences between itself and its environ ment systems thus handle the problem of overwhelming environmen tal complexity by reducing it in terms of the selectivity made available by the systems selfreferential code as Luhmann puts it The systems inferiority in complexity must be counterbalanced by strategies of se lection Complexity in this sense he continues means being forced to select and thus in his winning formulation only complexity can reduce complexity23 Under pressure to adapt to a complex and chang ing environment systems increase their selectivitythey make their environmental filters more finely woven if you likeby building up their own internal complexity by means of selfreferential closure and the reentry of the systemenvironment distinction within the system itself in a process of internal differentiation24 For example the difference between the legal system and its en vironment is reintroduced in the legal system itself which now serves as the environment for the various subsystems of the law and the same could be said within the educational system about the vari ous academic disciplines and subdisciplines and so on25 This self referential closure however does not indicate solipsism idealism or isolation but is instead crucial to understanding a fundamental prin ciple I will return to throughout these pages the principle of what I call openness from closure It does not contradict the systems open ness to the environment Instead in the selfreferential mode of opera tion closure is a form of broadening possible environmental contacts closure increases by constituting elements more capable of being de termined the complexity of the environment that is possible for the system And this is why Luhmann writes selfreference is in itself nothing bad forbidden or to be avoided indeed it points directly to system formation because systems can become complex only if they succeed in solving this problem and thus in deparadoxicalizing themselves26 What makes such systems paradoxical in the first place is the unity of the difference between the two sides of the distinction that anchors the systems code For example the firstorder distinction be tween legal and illegal in the legal system is itself a product of the codes own selfreferencethat is to say the problem is that both sides of the distinction are instantiated by one side of the distinction namely the legal hence the tautology legal is legal But the tautological unity of this distinction may be disclosed only by a secondorder observer operating within another system and another code which must re main blind to its paradoxical distinction if it is to use that distinction to process events for the systems autopoiesis and so on and so forth The formal notation for this dynamic that Luhmann borrows from George SpencerBrowns Laws of Form will help make this clearer As Bruce Clarke summarizes it the form consists of four elements 1 the indi cation or marked state of a distinctions inside 2 the indications unmarked state or the outside of the distinction 3 the distinction itself as a unity of its marked and unmarked states and 4 a second meaning and event distinction between marked and unmarked spaces made by a second order observer which will obey the same form27 Thus What is most interesting here however is that these constitutive paradoxes far from hindering the autopoiesis of selfreferential systems in fact force their autopoiesis28 And herein this transvaluation of the paradoxes of selfreference from paralytic to productivethe lines of re lation between systems theory and deconstruction come quite clearly into view If we want to observe paradoxical communications as de framing and reframing deconstructing and reconstructing operations Luhmann writes we need a concept of meaning    as the simultaneous presentation    of actuality and possibility    The distinction actualpossible is a form that reenters itself On one side of the distinction the actual the distinction actualpossible reappears it is copied into itself    If we observe such a reentry we see a paradox The reentering distinction is the same and it is not the same But the paradox does not prevent the operations of the system On the contrary it is the condition of their possibility29 This is so Luhmann writes because the totality of the socalled present element    is related to something other than itself thereby keeping within itself the mark of the past element while at the same time being vitiated by the mark of its relation to the future element thus constituting what is called the present by means of this very relation to what it is not31 Or as Luhmann puts it One could say that meaning equips an actual experience or action with redundant possibilitiesnamely what was selected the actual and what could have been the possibleand this is crucial for any systems ability to respond to environmental complexity by building up its own complex ity via the form of meaning This is what Luhmann means when he says that this formal requirement refers meaning to the problem of complexity32 The genesis and reproduction of meaning presupposes an infrastructure in reality that constantly changes its states he writes Meaning then ex tracts differences which only as differences have meaning from this substructure to enable a differenceoriented processing of information On all meaning therefore are imposed a temporalized complexity and the compulsion to a constant shifting of actuality without mean ing itself vibrating in tune with that substructure 63 From an adap tive and evolutionary point of view then selfreference and the form of meaning do not indicate solipsism Quite the contrary As Luhmann points out it is unproductive for meanings to circulate as mere self referentiality or in shortcircuited tautologies    One can think This rose is a rose is a rose is a rose But this use of a recursive path is pro ductive only if it makes itself dependent on specific conditions and does not always ensue 61 And herein lies the difference for Luhmann between meaning and information one that recalls Derridas emphasis in Limited Inc on the specific pragmatics of iterability Luhmann contin ues A piece of information that is repeated is no longer information It retains its meaning in the repetition but loses its value as information One reads in the paper that the deutsche mark has risen in value If one reads this a second time in another paper this activity no longer has value as information    although structurally it presents the same selection Something can be meaningful in other words but have no informational value or to put it another wayone that will bear di rectly on my discussion of form and poetry in chapter 10form and formalism are only part of the story when it comes to meaning meaning and event One thus begins not with identity but with differencewith two differences in fact the difference inherent in every experience between what is actually given and what can possibly result from it that is given in the internal form of meaning itself and the difference between meaning and information that is forced on the system by environmental complexity and temporality Only thus can one give accidents informational value and thereby construct order because information is nothing more than an event that brings about a con nection between differencesa difference that makes a difference Therefore we encounter the decomposition of meaning per se the de tautologization of meanings selfreference forced on the system by the adaptive pressure of the environment of the outside world 75 This is whycontrary to the view of systems theory as solipsistic im perialistic and so onLuhmann insists that the difference between meaning and world is formed for this process of the continual self determination of meaning as the difference between order and per turbation between information and noise Both are and both remain necessary The unity of the difference is and remains the basis for op eration This cannot be emphasized strongly enough A preference for mean ing over world for order over perturbation for information over noise is only a preference It does not enable one to dispense with the contrary 83 italics mine In the form of meaning then we find that systems increase their contacts with their environments paradoxically by virtualizing them Meaning is the continual actualization of potentialities Luhmann writes but because meaning can be meaning only as the difference between what is actual at any given moment and a horizon of possibilities every actualization always also leads to a virtualization of the potentialities that could be connected up with it The instability of meaning resides in the untenability of its core of actuality the ability to restabilize is provided by the fact that everything actual has meaning only within a horizon of possibilities    that can and must be selected as the next actuality    Thus one can treat the difference between actual ity and possibility in terms of temporal displacement and thereby pro cess indications of possibility with every new actuality Meaning is the unity of actualization and virtualization of reactualization and revirtualization as a selfpropelling process 65 This virtualization via meaning is an extraordinarily powerful evo lutionary dynamic and it is put to good use by both psychic and social systems Indeed Luhmann insists Not all systems process complex ity and selfreference in the form of meaningand here one could think of various biological systems33but for those that do it is the only possibility Meaning becomes for them the form of the world and consequently overlaps the difference between system and envi ronment 61 Or as Luhmann sometimes characterizes itin a for mulation resonant not only with Derridas essays such as Structure Sign and Play but also with Emersons philosophy and the core pre occupations of romanticismThe relationship between meaning and world can also be described with the concept of decentering As mean ing the world is accessible everywhere in every situation in any de tail which is to say that the world is indicated in all meaning To that state of affairs corresponds an acentric world concept 70 and hence the closure of the selfreferential order is synonymous here with the infinite openness of the world 62 This coimplication of psychic and social systems via the formal dynamics of meaning combined with Luhmanns simultaneous insis tence on the strict separation of psychic and social systems as discrete autopoietic entities marks one of systems theorys most difficult and counterintuitive featuresbut also one of its most powerful innova tions In a formulation as matteroffact as it is beguiling Luhmann writes Humans cannot communicate not even their brains can com municate not even their conscious minds can communicate Only communication can communicate34 What we experience as our own mind operates as an isolated autopoietic system he points out and in fact that isolation is an indispensable condition of its possibility 170 There is no conscious link between one mind and another nor is there any operational unity of more than one mind as a systemall of which Luhmann argues is essentially taken for granted at this point by contemporary neurophysiology 170 Indeed he asks how could any psychic system maintain its own functions if it shared its unity with other minds How could I deliver a lecture if I shared the momentto moment ebb and flow of psychic activity of even one other conscious ness in the room In this sense communication Luhmann writes operates with an unspecific reference to the participating state of meaning and event mind it is especially unspecific as to perception It cannot copy states of mind cannot imitate them cannot represent them This is the basis for the possibility of communications building up a complexity of its own 178 Our intuitions of course would seem to suggest otherwise and this is so precisely because psychic systems and social systems have coevolved each serving as the environment for the other and this has led to a common achievement employed by psychic as well as social systems35 That achievement of course is meaning Meaning Luhmann writes is the true substance of this emergent evolution ary level It is therefore false or more gently it is falsely chosen an thropocentrism to assign the psychic    ontological priority over the social It is impossible to find a supporting substance for meaning Meaning supports itself in that it enables its own selfreferential repro duction And only the forms of this reproduction differentiate psychic and so cial structuresnamely whether consciousness in the case of psychic systems or communication social systems is chosen as the form of operation 98 Here as I have already suggested we find Luhmanns answer to Derridas critique of the autoaffection of the voice and of consciousness as presence in Speech and Phenomena Of Grammatology and elsewhere of the fallacy that writing or communication could be referred for its efficacy as a representation to an ontic substrate of consciousness and the psychic system whereas in fact it is the onto logically unsupported urdynamic of writing Derrida or meaning Luhmann that is fundamental and allows psychic and social systems to interpenetrate And as we will see in later chapters 8 and 10 the disarticulation and interpenetration of consciousness and communica tion are crucial to how art and within that poetry engages in a par ticular form of communication that is barred to other social systems The difficulty in understanding this disarticulation of conscious ness and communication Luhmann points out in a disarmingly commonsensical moment lies in that every consciousness that tries to do so is itself a selfreferentially closed system and therefore cannot get outside of consciousness For consciousness even communication can only be conducted consciously and is invested in further possible consciousness But for communication this is not so Communication is only possible as an event that transcends the closure of consciousness as the synthesis of more than the content of just one consciousness 99 The confusing of consciousness and communication if one wants to put it that way is precisely why the concept of meaning must be employed on such a high theoretical level Meaning enables psychic and social systems to interpenetrate while protecting their autopoiesis meaning simultaneously enables consciousness to understand itself and continue to affect itself in communication and enables communication to be re ferred back to the consciousness of the participants 219 The allimportant medium that allows this interpenetration via the form of meaning to take place is you will have already guessed language But this does not mean language determines consciousness Luhmann writes psychic processes are not linguistic processes he continues nor is thought in any way internal dialogue as has been falsely maintained It lacks an internal addressee There is no second I no self in the conscious system no me visàvis an I no addi tional authority that examines all linguistically formed thoughts to see whether it will accept or reject them and whose decision conscious ness seeks to anticipate 272 Luhmanns point here no doubt takes for granted similar formulations throughout Derridas early work in Speech and Phenomena Of Grammatology and elsewhere but the empha sis in Luhmann falls rather differently on the evolutionary aspects of this disarticulation What is important for Luhmann is that one must do justice to the powerful role of language in the coevolution of psy chic and social systems while simultaneously paying attention to their autopoiesis and selfreferential closure On the one hand the evolu tion of social communication is only possible in a constantly operative link with states of consciousness which is provided by the medium of language on the other hand language transfers social complexity into psychic complexity SS 272 in a process generically referred to in contemporary theory as subjectification or subject formation36 The social system places its own complexity which has stood the test of communicative manageability at the psychic systems disposal but at the same time language and even more writing ensures for the communication system what Maturana calls the conservation of meaning and event adaptation the constant accommodation of communication to the mind They define the free space of autopoiesis within the social com munication system37 For Luhmann then language is not constitutive of either psychic or social systems but is rather a specific secondorder phenomenona type of symbolically generalized communication mediathat those systems use in the services of the firstorder processes of meaning for maintaining their own autopoiesis while at the same time enabling them to interpenetrate and use each others complexity to mutual benefit38 From Luhmanns point of view language is not just a means of communication because it functions in psychic systems without communication in the strict sense of having to take place 94 but at the same time communication is also possible without language and may take place in all sorts of nonlinguistic ways perhaps through laughing through questioning looks through dress and so on 150 In fact what is fundamental about communication for Luhmann is not its disrelation to language but that it is a synthesis of three selec tions 147 information the content if you like to be communicated utterance the specific pragmatic communicative event or behavior selected to communicate information and understanding a receivers processing of the difference between information and utterance that completes the communicative act 14042 147 151 Again the issue is not just difference all forms of meaning of which communication is a specific instance operate by means of difference the issue is whether to remember Gregory Batesons phrase an utterance is a difference that makes a difference in terms of the systems autopoiesis Or as Luhmann puts it difference as such begins to work if and insofar as it can be treated as information in selfreferential systems 40 To recall Luhmanns earlier example of the value of the deutsche mark an utter ance once repeated may retain the same form as meaning but lose its status as information it retains the same form but has lost its capacity to select the systems states 40not because its form has changed but because the state of the system has This fact draws our attention in turn to what Derrida in Limited Inc calls the specific pragmatically determined nature of any instance of undecidability the emphasis on which would seem to run counter to Luhmanns assertion that com munication is realized if and to the extent that understanding comes about 147 Here again however Derrida and Luhmann converge on the same point from opposite directions while Derrida emphasizes the final undecidability of any signifying instance Luhmann stresses that even so systems must decide they must selectively process the differ ence between information and utterance if they are to achieve adaptive resonance with their environments Thus underneath this apparent divergence is a shared emphasisagainst relativism and anything goes reflexivityon the determinate specificity of the signifying or communicative instance that must be negotiated which is precisely why in Limited Inc Derrida rejects the term indeterminacy because it occludes an understanding of the determinate oscillation between pos sibilities for example of meaning but also of acts39 In Luhmann as in Derrida writing takes center stage as the paradigm of communication but only because it exemplifies a deeper trace structure the grammè of the program as it were of meaning a paradigm whose essential logic is for Luhmann only intensified by the sorts of later technical developments beginning with printing in which we have already seen Derrida himself keenly interested in texts like Without Alibi and Archive Fever In this light the problem with oral speech as Luhmann describes it is that it threatens to collapse the difference between information and utterance performatively subordi nating information to utterance and presuming their simultaneity leaving literally no time for doubt as Luhmann puts it40in precisely the manner analyzed in Derridas early critique of the subordination of writing to speaking But if the value of language is that it is the medium that increases the understandability of communication be yond the sphere of perception 160 then writing is its full realization Only writing Luhmann observes enforces the clear distinction between information and utterance and only writing and printing suggest communicative processes that react not to the unity of but to the difference between utterance and information    Writing and printing enforce an experience of the difference that constitutes com munication they are in this precise sense more communicative forms of communication 16263 Language then may be a medium distinguished by the use of signsone that is capable of extending the repertoire of understand able communication almost indefinitely in practice an achievement meaning and event whose significance can hardly be overestimated But it rests however on functional specification Therefore one must also keep its boundaries in view 160 For Luhmannand this is something like the nega tive image or reverse aspect of Derridas early reading of Saussure spe cifically his drawing out the full implications of Saussures contention that language is a diacritical system that operates without positive termsto subsume the dynamics of meaning under the theory of the sign is to ignore what he calls the basal recursive selfreference that forms the context in which all signs are determined 71 Hence the concept of the symbolic generalization of meanings selfreference replaces the concept of the sign that until now has dominated the theoretical tradition 94 And it also provides an important bridge between Derridas contention that the trace structure of writingcom munication is not limited to the domain of the human and the lin guistic alonea contention that Luhmanns work allows us to situate within a coevolutionary account of the relations between meaning communication language and the forms of complexity they make possible in psychic and social systems For Luhmann whether or not to understand Derrida precisely in terms of the theoretical tradition of the sign has been a matter of some uncertaintyan uncertainty that mirrors to a large extent broader disagreements in theory and philosophy about how Derrida is to be read and whether moreover the same understanding applies to his earlier versus later work41 At certain times Luhmann suggests a high degree of translatability between the two theories while at others he is concerned to keep his distance42 But my point here is not to rehearse these differences much less to suggest which understanding of Derrida is right nor is it to further systematize the relationship between Luhmann and Derrida along the lines already carried out quite ably by critics such as Dietrich Schwanitz David Wellbery Drucilla Cornell Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht and others Rather my point is to suggest that if systems theory needs deconstruction in the sense I touched on at the outset then deconstruction also needs systems theory to help carry out work toward which it has in comparison only gestured This complementarity rests as I have been arguing on two fun damental disarticulations in Luhmann that are at the core of Derridas work as well the disarticulation of psychic and social systems and on an even more fundamental level the disarticulation of the formal dynamics of meaning from language per se In my viewand I will develop this claim in detail over a range of contexts in the next three chaptersit is from this double disarticulation that the ethical and po litical ambitions of deconstruction derive Those ambitionsand how they are motivated by a certain set of theoretical commitmentsare aptly expressed by Derrida at moments like this one in the interview Eating Well to which I will have occasion to return more than once during these pages If one reinscribes language in a network of possibilities that do not merely encompass it but mark it irreducibly from the inside everything changes I am thinking in particular of the mark in general of the trace of iterability of différance These possibilities or necessities without which there would be no language are themselves not only human    And what I am proposing here should allow us to take into account sci entific knowledge about the complexity of animal languages genetic coding all forms of marking within which socalled human language as original as it might be does not allow us to cut once and for all where we would in general like to cut43 At such moments Derrida unfolds the implications of the point he first made for US audiences in Of Grammatology that the form and force of différance the grammè and the trace indicates a recursive it erative dynamics of meaning that exceeds the rather tidy purview of human linguisticality alone As Derrida puts it in Of Grammatology In all senses of the word writing thus comprehends language 7 And it is on the strength of that theoretical commitment that the ethical issues involvedin this particular case issues related to what is popularly known as animal rightsarise Similarly in a remarkable late essay on Lacans rendering of the humananimal divide visàvis the subject of the signifier which I ex plore in some detail in the next chapter the ethical question of our ob ligations to nonhuman beings is generated by a theoretical articulation of the force of the trace versus the Lacanian signifier that pushes Derridas thought very much in the direction of Luhmanns work on the dynamics of meaning in autopoietic systems As Derrida puts it there It is difficult to reserve as Lacan does the differentiality of signs meaning and event for human language only as opposed to animal coding What he at tributes to signs that in a language understood as belonging to the human order take on their value from their relations to each other and so on and not just from the fixed correlation between signs and reality can and must be accorded to any code animal or human44 Not only do such passages make clear that Derrida is offering us not a theory of language nor even one of writing but a far more ambitious and thoroughly posthumanist account of the paradoxi cal and deconstructive dynamics of meaning they also make it clear that the account of meaning in systems theory should be viewed as the reconstruction of deconstruction one that provides the sort of rigor ously articulated analysis toward which deconstruction only gestures philosophically but for that very reason in a sense more provocatively than the science of Luhmanns sociology This joining of forces be tween deconstruction and systems theory is crucial I would like to think not just from systems theorys vantage but from deconstructions as well Derrida points toward this necessity in an important footnote in Positions where he writes The critique of historicism in all its forms seems to me indispens able    The issue would be can one criticize historicism in the name of something other than truth and science the value of universality omnitemporality the infinity of value etc and what happens to sci ence when the metaphysical value of truth has been put into question etc How are the effects of science and of truth to be reinscribed    Finally it goes without saying that in no case is it a question of a dis course against truth or against science This is impossible and absurd as is every heated accusation on this subject And when one analyzes systematically the value of truth    it is not in order to return naively to a relativist or sceptical empiricism45 If we believe Gunther Teubner such a perspective only draws into even sharper focus the need to supplement deconstruction with sys tems theory whose explanatory force resides not only in a renovation of science that enables it to take account of selfreference and the mani fold challenges of constructivism but also in its ability to link these epistemological innovations to the historical emergence and specificity of particular social forms Moreover Teubner suggests systems theory thus enables us to understand a crucial fact about social and political ef fectivity that in his view is lost onor at least lost indeconstruction that the disclosure of paradox does not in itself threaten the autopoie sis of social systems a point that in turn bears on the putative politi cal force of deconstructions philosophical intervention As Teubner puts itand this would I think actually amount to taking seriously Derridas insistence on the specific pragmatically determined char acter of all instances of iteration and undecidability now writ large Derridas nightmare is that it is the secret of autopoiesis that social systems are no longer threat ened by the paradoxes of their deconstructive reading Autopoietic selfreproduction means that in routine operations they are constantly deparadoxifying their foundational paradox Thus they are capable of deconstructing deconstruction of course not in the sense that they can exclude it on a longterm basis but in the sense that they shift dis place disseminate historicize deconstruction itself which drastically changes the conditions of its possibility46 What this suggests for Teubner is that a deconstruction that took ac count of the foundational paradoxes of emerging social systems would need to become historical especially to recognize its own trans formations While the basic structures of the paradox remain the same social processes of their invisibilization and the threatening moments of their reemergence depend on historical contingencies    The dis tinctions which are used for deparadoxification he continues are dependent on historicalsocietal conditions of plausibility of accept ability are contingent on binding knowledge in particular societies47 Now one might well argue that Derridas workparticularly his later investigations of questions of justice in relation to law rights and so on both in his own work and in that of his interlocutorsis quite cognizant of this fact and indeed does what it does precisely to con front such systems of binding knowledge with internal paradoxes and contradictions to which they must respond But my larger point here is that the ahistorical asociological character of deconstruction is not at all obviously a failure per se on Derridas part as Teubner would have it indeed it might well be viewed from the vantage Derrida voices above on the effects of truth as a resolutely philosophical meaning and event refusal Derridas rejoinder to Teubner would no doubt be that systems theoryeven on Luhmanns termscannot have its science and eat it too This is so because as Luhmann explains the particular kind of operation that uses distinctions in the services of designation is called observation We are caught once again therefore in a circle the distinction between operation and observation appears itself as an element of observation48 Empiricism in other words must always give way to contingent and deconstructable selfreference even if we acknowledge that observation takes place always in pragmatically de termined instances of historical articulation From a Derridean point of view then the advantage that Teubner finds in Luhmanns historically oriented analysis would simply be re ferred back to an empiricism whose untenability Luhmann himself makes clear Luhmann Derrida would argue cannot maintain that there exists no observerindependent given reality49 and at the same time hold that selfreference designates the unity that an element a process or a system is for itself For itself means independent of the cut of observation by others50 If it is indeed the case that both attri butions observer attribution and object attribution are possible and that the results can therefore be considered contingent51 then this means from a Derridean point of view that the empiricism on which any historicism depends and tacitly trades is rendered permanently problematic What we are really dealing with is a specific undecid ability in the domain of meaning about what sorts of attributions are made by whom and to whom and with what particular effects Thus when Luhmann holds that the difference between selfreference in the object and selfreference in the analysis between the observed and the observing system comes to be reflected in the problem of com plexity52 what this really means in Derridean terms is comes to be reflected in the deconstructibility of the very distinctions upon which such a formulation depends Moreover Derrida would surely be the first to argue that even if such distinctions are tenable in analytical terms to take Luhmanns procedure at its word when they come to be expressed in language then our ability to draw clear boundaries between what Luhmann calls the empirical analytical and semantic dimensions of observation description is only further eroded There are then at least three orders of complexity here the autopoietic selfreference neither analytical logical nor linguistic per se of any system that makes selfreference and heteroreference a product of its own selfreferential closure a sec ond level of complexity in which some of those autopoietic systems use the form of meaning to process environmental complexity and re produce themselves and a third level of autopoietic systems that in addition to using basal selfreference and meaning also use language To acknowledge as much is from a Derridean point of view simply to take account of what we have already discussed as the contaminating force of iterabilityits monstrosity as Derrida puts itwhich miti gates against the kind of conceptual ideality that would appear to be in play in Luhmanns assumption that the empirical analytical and semantic dimensions can be so neatly separated Hence as Derrida insists in Limited Inc there can be no rigorous analogy between a sci entific theory    and a theory of language and in fact it is more scientific to take this limit if it is one into account and to treat it as a point of departure for rethinking this or that received concept of sci ence and of objectivity 118 What is involved here then to return to the text of Derridas with which we began is a certain difference between Derrida and Luhmann in relation to thinking the grammar of the event As Derrida insisted for over forty years I dont know what a grammar of the event can be except as Peggy Kamuf puts it in her introduction to Without Alibi as a reduction a cancellation of the very thing being called event53 Of course Luhmann would respond that the only way any of us are even around to declare such an inability at all is precisely on the basis of a prior reduction of environmental complexity one that provides the autopoietic conditions of possibility for raising such questions or any questions in the first place Or in Luhmanns words One must be capable of generating both continuity and discontinuity which is easier in reality than in theory54 This page intentionally left blank Language Representation and Species Cognitive Science versus Deconstruction I want to begin with a storya dog story in fact Its a story about an experiment in canine signifying abilities that appeared on June 11 2004 in my hometown newspaper the Houston Chronicle It was a re print of an article that appeared that same day in the Washington Post which in turn was about the lead article in the June 11 2004 issue of Science The Post story carried the title Common Collie or Uberpooch German Pets Vocabulary Stuns Scientists I prefer my hometown headline Dogs May Be as Smart as Owners Think They Are be cause it unwittingly directs us toward a question that I will insist is essential to addressing these kinds of issues a question that definitively separates cognitive science represented here by Daniel Dennett and deconstruction in the person here of Jacques Derrida That question is what language is and how it is related to our ideas about subjectivity consciousness and the like And that question in turn cannot be ad dressed without investigating our assumptions about what knowledge is and the kinds of knowledge we can have of ourselves and of others in this case the hardest case perhaps nonhuman others represented here by the taxonomy Canis familiaris In the most general terms then the issue that separates cognitive science and deconstruction is one that goes all the way down both epistemologically and ethically whether or not knowledgeincluding knowledge of our own subjec tivity and that of othersis representational and within that how we are to construe the relationship between epistemological and ontologi cal questions In light of these concerns the sort of intervention I am attempting here is of particular moment because Daniel Dennetts work is often re garded as a more philosophically attuned version of what is taken to be a core feature of cognitive science generally that it is thought to be in its functionalism resolutely postontological and postrepresentational language r epr esentation and species in precisely this way In this light Dennetts work presents itself as a less reductive and more nuanced version of what Terrence Deacon in The Symbolic Species characterizes as materialistic reductionism which offers in theories of mind and consciousness the dominant alternative to the Cartesian perspective It is exemplified he writes by the theoretical claim that the mind is like the sort of computa tion that takes place in electronic computers In simpler terms minds are software programs run on the hardware neural circuits of the brain The strong version of this claim or the weakest depending on your point of view is called eliminative materialism which holds that notions such as mind intention belief thought representation and so on will eventually be eliminated in discussions of cognitive pro cesses in favor or more mechanistic synonyms that refer to chemical electrical signaling processes of the brain Mentalistic terms it is sug gested are merely glosses for more complex brain processes that we at present do not understand1 With those contexts in mind let us return to the story of Rico the Uberpooch if he is one According to the various reports this nineyearold border collie living in Germany with his human com panions has recently been shown in a series of careful studies car ried out by Julia Fischer a biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig a good pedigree Id say to have a stunningly large vocabulary of about 200 words that cor respond to a collection of toys balls and the like a range compa rable to that of great apes dolphins and parrots that have undergone extensive training in language experiments2 In these experiments Rico and his owner were placed in one room and ten of the dogs toys were placed in another The dog was then instructed by his owner to retrieve two randomly selected objects named by the owner while the owner remained secluded in the separate room to avoid any chance of Clever Hans activity In forty tests Rico was accurate thirtyseven times Even more impressively in the next phase of the study the researchers put seven of his toys in the room along with one he had never seen before The owner then called out the unfamiliar name of the new toy and Rico was correct in seven out of ten tries Finally in the last phase researchers tested Rico a month later and he still remembered the name of the new toy three out of six times without language r epr esentation and species having seen it since the first testa rate of success equivalent to that of a human threeyearold3 The key finding of the study we are told is that Rico is appar ently capable of a process called fast mappingan ability to instantly assign a meaning to a new word a strategy human toddlers use to learn language at a prodigious rate and a skill thought to be exclu sively the province of humans Rico apparently can do something sci entists thought only humans could do figure out by process of elimi nation that a sound he has never heard before must be the name of a toy he has never seen before Stein According to the authors of the study all of this suggests that mammals developed abilities to under stand sounds before humans learned to speak Czuczka and Ricos remarkable learning abilities may indicate that some parts of speech comprehension developed separately from human speech You dont have to be able to talk to understand Dr Fischer observes And Sue SavageRumbaughwhose language acquisition work at Georgia State University with the bonobo Kanzi is wellknowngoes even further in a commentary published in the same issue of Science sug gesting that if Rico had a human vocal tract one would presume that he should be able to say the names of the items as well or at least try to do so Stein Of course we might well add to this appendix of scientific com mentary that appears alongside the publication of the study in Science the remarks of Daniel Dennett the director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University whose books Consciousness Explained and Kinds of Minds Toward an Understanding of Consciousness would seem to shed light not only on what we have discovered about the cogni tive abilities and mental life of our Uberpooch but also on the ethical implications thereof Indeed from Dennetts point of view it is hard to overstate how much it matters in ethical terms that we are able to be as specific as possible about the cognition and consciousness of particular beings What makes a mind powerful he writes indeed what makes a mind consciousis not what it is made of or how big it is but what it can do Can it concentrate Can it be distracted Can it recall earlier events    When such questions as these are answered we will know everything we need to know about those minds in order to answer the morally important questions4 As Dennett puts language r epr esentation and species it Membership in the class of things that have minds provides an all important guarantee the guarantee of a certain sort of moral stand ing Only mindhavers can care only mindhavers can mind what hap pens 4 As I have already suggested Dennetts functionalist approach to questions such as what is a mindhavernot what is it but what can it dois perhaps what he is best known for but what I want to argue now is that Dennetts apparent functionalism and material ism are unable to escape the spell of the very philosophical tradition whose most extreme expression is Cartesian idealism that he suppos edly rejects In Kinds of Minds and throughout his work Dennett rightly rejects the idea that some central Agent or Boss or Audience 73 what he also sometimes calls a Cartesian puppeteer 80takes in and appreciates the information produced by the neural networks and uses it to steer the ship of subjectivity 73 In what he debunks as the myth of double transduction the nervous system first trans duces input from its environment light sound temperature etc into neural signals and then in a second moment in some special central place it transduces these trains of impulses into some other medium the medium of consciousness 72 The idea that the network itself could assume the role of the inner Boss and thus harbor conscious ness seems preposterous but that is exactly what happens he argues in the distributed networks in both brain and body from which con sciousness arises 73 To ask for something moreto assume that what you are is something else some Cartesian res cogitans in addition to all this brainandbody activityis to betray a deep confusion because what you are just is this organization of all the competitive activity between a host of competences that your body has developed 15556 To ask for more is to remain captive to what he calls the Cartesian theater the specter of a disembodied freefloating central knower or self who stands aside from and above these processes at once the product and appreciator of them Dennetts apparently robust materialist account of embodied consciousness and mentation buttressed by an impressive understand ing of neural networks evolutionary processes perceptual mecha nisms and the like would seem to find an apt accompaniment in an understanding of language within the context of a larger prosthetics language r epr esentation and species of signifying systems in all their technicity and exteriority one that would seem quite consonant with contemporary theorists in the hu manities and social sciences from Derrida and Kittler to Bateson and Luhmann5 The source of our greater intelligence when compared to our mammalian relatives he argues is not the size of our brains but our habit of offloading as much as possible of our cognitive tasks into the environment itselfextruding our minds that is our men tal projects and activities into the surrounding world where a host of peripheral devices we construct can store process and represent our meanings streamlining enhancing and protecting the processes of transformation that are our thinkinga process that releases us from the limitations of our animal brains And thanks to our pros thetically enhanced imaginations he continues we can formulate otherwise imponderable unnoticeable metaphysical possibilities6 The problem is that it is not clear how such prosthetic processes and devices can be said to constituteto store process and represent in Dennetts wordsour thinking After all if we pay attention to the material social technical and cultural complexities of such de vices then in what sense can the internal psychic states Dennett calls our thinking be said to be represented by such devices And this is obviously true not just for storage devices such as archives encyclo pedias books and the institutional and disciplinary contexts in which they are embedded but also for that first and most fundamental pros thesis of all language itself which cannot be said to represent our thinking for at least two reasons First as Niklas Luhmann has put it with characteristic astringency language like all forms of communi cation operates with an unspecific reference to the participating state of mind it is especially unspecific as to perception It cannot copy states of mind cannot imitate them cannot represent them7 Second there can be no representation of our thinking in language because the meaning of an utterance is always subject to differential interpretation an interpretation that itself takes place within multiply embedded pro tocols traditions conventions and so on If this werent the case then it would be a private language and we couldnt use it to communicate our thinking at all All of whichas David Wills has reminded us in multiple registers in his wonderful book Prosthesis and elsewhere is built in to the very logic of the prosthetic itself As Wills puts it we language r epr esentation and species are dealing here with technologies of the exteriorization of memory of which writing is a if not the fundamental historically identifiable form And this has serious consequences for how we think about sub jectivity because technology in these terms is the extemporization the movement out of selfpresence that permits and defines memory a prosthetization of the animate or the human that not only makes it difficult to rigorously distinguish the human from its inanimate other but also makes us forever removed from ourselves as the very condition of what it means to be human8 But the primary problem with Dennett as we are about to see is not just that he overlooks how the prosthetic nature of the human permanently destabilizes the boundaries between our thinking and anyoneor more radically anythingelses It is that he thenin a subsidiary moveuses a fundamentally representationalist concept of language that reinstalls the disembodied Cartesian subject at the very heart of his supposedly embodied materialist functionalism Indeed it is on this basis that the ontologically unique status of the human and all the ethical consequences that flow from itis established in Dennetts work Now few would argue with Dennetts observation that there is no step more uplifting more explosive more momentous in the his tory of mind design that the invention of language through which Homo sapiens stepped into a slingshot that has launched it far beyond all other earthly species in the power to look ahead and reflect But we begin to glimpse the problem with Dennetts theory in passages like the following The freefloating rationales that explain rudi mentary higherorder intentionality of birds and haresand even chimpanzeesare honored he writes in the designs of their ner vous systems but we are looking for something more we are looking for rationales that are represented in those nervous systems9 The problem here is not as he argues in Animal Consciousness What Matters and Why his insistence that we should be analyzing patterns of behavior external and internalbut not private and at tempting to interpret them in the light of evolutionary hypotheses re garding their past or current functions10 The problem here is that this something more turns out to be another version of the very user illusion that Dennett wants to rejecta userillusion provided by language r epr esentation and species Dennetts misunderstanding of language as something that can repre sent rationales in a nervous system as he puts it I want to pause for a moment to emphasize however brieflyin part to make it clear that I am not just picking on Dennettthat this theoretical misunderstanding and phenomenological misuse of language are common problems in work in and around the philosophical implica tions of cognitive science and I find them even in work that I admire by Gerald Edelman Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela among others11 Indeedto take only the last exampleMaturana and Varela offer an extremely valuable account of the evolutionary emergence of language proper from linguistic domainsan account that reaches back to Gregory Batesons important work on metacommunicative frames in mammalian communication especially in forms of play and forward to the latest work in these areas by Noam Chomsky Marc Hauser and others12 Maturana and Varela rightly conclude that on the basis of experimental evidence some nonhuman animals are capable of interacting with us in rich and even recursive linguistic domains and they even declare that based on these facts language remains a permanent biologic possibility in the natural drift of living beings13 But though it is certainly useful to combine their language now with Batesons to distinguish participation in a metacommunicative frame linguistic domains from the metametacommunicative frame that is language properthe ability to make a linguistic distinction of a linguistic distinction 210 as they put itit is questionbegging in the extreme as we have already seen to make the ontological category of subjectivity depend solely on this last attribute For as we have already seen to declare as Maturana and Varela do that selfconsciousness awareness mindthese are phenomena that take place in language 230 is to make a statement that if it is true is selfrefuting since as Luhmann would put it only language takes place in languagewhich is to say in a domain external to the self of selfconsciousness To return then to Dennett he argues that the sort of informa tional unification that is the most important prerequisite for our kind of consciousness is not anything we are born with not part of our in nate hardwiring but in surprisingly large measure is an artifact of our immersion in human culture So far so good But then Dennetts formulation takes a bizarre turn indeed language r epr esentation and species What that early education produces in us is a sort of benign user illusionI call it the Cartesian Theater the illusion that there is a place in our brains where the show goes on towards which all perceptual input streams whence flow all conscious intentions to act and speak I claim that other speciesand human beings when they are newborn simply are not beset by the illusion of the Cartesian Theater Until the organization is formed there is simply no user in there to be fooled14 But how one might ask is this really any different from the Cartesianism that Dennett rejects particularly when we remember his insistence on the difference between the freefloating rationales that explain rudi mentary higherorder intentionality of birds and hares that are merely a product of the designs of their nervous systems and the something more of human intentionality and consciousness rationales that are represented in those nervous systems Take for example the tortured trajectory of the following argu ment Many animals hide but dont think they are hiding Many ani mals flock but dont think they are flocking Dennett argues in Kinds of Minds15 they have knowhow as he puts it but not represented knowledge 154 Eventually some creatures began offloading problems into the world and just into other parts of their brains They began making and using representations but they didnt know they were doing so They didnt need to know Should we call this sort of unwitting use of representations thinking If so then we would have to say that these creatures were thinking but didnt know they were thinking Unconscious thinkingthose with a taste for para doxical formulations might favor this way of speaking but we could less misleadingly say that this was intelligent but unthinking behavior because it was not just not reflective but also not reflectableupon 154 The problem here is that reflectableupon behavior and represented knowledge in Dennetts scheme depend on the assumption that lan guage can provide by means of a grammatical fiction the very user illusion that Dennett has just disavowed Doubly problematic is that this conceptual and phenomenological restabilization of the subject by means of languageputting Humpty Dumpty back together again as it werenot only constitutes an illusion but also forms the very ontological specificity of the human itself an ontological specificity language r epr esentation and species that is no different in principle from the Cartesianism Dennett rejects Only here language is doing the work previously carried out by the Cartesian cogito As an example of such intelligent but unthinking behavior Dennett offers the distraction display among some species of low nesting birds who when predators approach their nest put on an os tentatious show of feigned injury captivating the predators attention and promising an easy kill that the predator now drawn away from the vulnerable eggs is never quite able to make 12122 Such behav iors among nonhuman animals are quite abundant and wellknown but none of them Dennett argues manifests what he calls the work ings of a thirdorder intentional system An important step toward becoming a person was the step up from a firstorder intentional system to a secondorder intentional system A first order intentional system has beliefs and desires about many things but not about beliefs and desires A secondorder intentional system has be liefs and desires about beliefs and desires its own or those of others A thirdorder intentional system would be capable of such feats as wanting you to believe that it wanted something 120 If this has a familiar ring to it it should because it is exactly the strat egy that Jacques Lacan famously usesin his essay of 1960 The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious16to juridically separate the human from the animal as that being alone among the living who can lie by telling the truth The animal in Lacans terms can pretend but not pretend to pretend only the human as subject of the signifier can do that As Jacques Derrida summarizes Lacans position in a recent essayand here the distance between Dennetts discourse and Lacans will become abso lutely minimal There is according to Lacan a clear distinction between what the ani mal is capable of namely strategic pretense    and what it is incapable of and incapable of witnessing to namely the deception of speech la tromperie de la parole within the order of the signifier and of Truth The deception of speech    involves lying to the extent that in promising what is true it includes the supplementary possibility of telling the truth in order to lead the other astray on order to have him believe something language r epr esentation and species other than what is true we know the Jewish story recounted by Freud and so often quoted by Lacan Why do you tell me that you are going to X in order to have me believe you are going to Y whereas you are indeed going to X According to Lacan the animal would be in capable of this type of lie of this deceit of this pretense in the second degree whereas the subject of the signifier within the human order would possess such a power and better still would emerge as subject instituting itself and coming to itself as subject by virtue of this power a seconddegree reflexive power a power that is conscious of being able to deceive by pretending to pretend17 As I have already suggested one of the ironies of Dennetts discourse is that even as it promises a rigorous clearheaded view of these complexitiesDont confuse ontological questions about what exists with epistemological questions about how we know about it he ad monishes in the opening pages of Kinds of Mindsit reproduces in detail the Cartesian position it claims to move beyond and does so moreover precisely because it is unwilling or unable to pursue the full implications of the paradoxical formulations such as intelligent but unthinking behavior that it leads itself into but refuses to think through As Derridas later work makes clear that Cartesianism rests on two fundamental points 1 the assertion that animals however so phisticated they may be can only react but not respond to what goes on around them And this is so because 2 the capacity to respond depends on the ability to wield concepts or representations which is in turn possible only on the basis of languageand precisely in the sense voiced by Dennett when he writes No matter how close a dogs concept of cat is to yours extensionally you and the dog discriminate the same sets of entities as cats and noncats it differs radically in one way the dog cannot consider its concept    No languageless mammal can have a concept of snow in the way we can because a languageless mammal has no way of considering snow in general or in itself18 Two points need to be registered hereone experimental or sci entific as it were and one philosophical First as Donna Haraway has recently pointed out the entire picture of language and nonhuman mental life has become considerably more complicated during the past several years Indeed even Noam Chomsky has recently argued in a paper coauthored with two Harvard researchers that the available language r epr esentation and species data suggests a much stronger continuity between animals and humans with respect to speech than previously believed We argue that the con tinuity hypothesis thus deserves the status of a null hypothesis which must be rejected by comparative work before any claims of uniqueness can be validated For now this null hypothesis of no truly novel traits in the speech domain appears to stand This conclusion is based in no small part on the authors contention that even if we distinguish between lan guage in the broad sensecomposed of many interacting subsystems sensorimotor and computationalintentional that do not necessarily evolve as a unit as Haraway puts itand language in a more narrow sense the recursive ability to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements as they write linguistic uniqueness in this second sense must be a testable hypothesis not an assumption rooted in premises of human exceptionalism in Haraways words19 Most of the recent experimental data as it happens does not tend in the direction of an unquestioned exceptionalism In fact Chomsky and his colleagues argue that the powerful capacities such as those that manifest them selves in the capability of discrete infinity that characterizes language in the narrow sense might well have evolved in Haraways words in domains other than communication such as territory mapping spatial navigation and foraging and then been hijacked for communication in ways uncoupled from tight constraints of function 373n44 And this of course has profound implications for the ontologicaland eventually ethicalstatus of nonhuman beings for it would lead us to disarticulate these questions from language ability in the limited sense rather than assimilate and collapse them as Dennett has done As Marc Hauser one of Chomskys coauthorsargues in a separate study and again I quote Haraway this means that organisms possess heterogeneous sets of mental tools complexly and dynamically put together from genetic developmental and learning interactions throughout their lives not unitary interiors that one either has or does not have20 This in turn leads me to my second point the philosophical one that Dennetts supposedly hardnosed materialist account of em bodied consciousness falls in line not just with the philosophical ideal ism of Descartes but also that of Heidegger whose characterization of the animal as that which has a world in the mode of nothaving depends as Derrida argues in Of Spirit on the inability of the animal language r epr esentation and species to have access to entities as such and in their Being because of a lack of language that is not primarily or simply linguistic but rather as Derrida puts it derives from the properly phenomenological impos sibility of speaking the phenomenon21 In light of Derridas critique then Dennetts discourse takes its place in a long line of philosophers from Aristotle to Lacan Kant Heidegger and Levinas all of whom as Derrida puts it say the same thing the animal is without language Or more precisely unable to respond to respond with a response that could be precisely and rigorously distinguished from a reaction22 Even those who from Descartes to Lacan have conceded to the said animal some aptitude for signs and for communication Derrida con tinues have always denied it the power to respondto pretend to lie to cover its tracks or erase its own traceshence the fallback position we find here in Dennett and Lacan when more explicitly metaphysical versions of humanism are no longer available the difference between communication and metacommunication signifying and signifying about signifying thinking and knowing youre thinking and so on But the problem with this position as Derrida points out is that it seems difficult in the first place to identify or determine a limit that is to say an indivisible threshold between pretense and pretense of pretense How could one distinguish he continues for example in the most elementary sexual parade or mating game be tween a feint and a feint of a feint If it is impossible to provide the criterion for such a distinction one can conclude that every pretense of pretense remains a simple pretense animal or imaginary in Lacans terms or else on the contrary and just as likely the every pretense however simple it may be gets repeated and reposited undecidably in its possibility as pretense of pretense human or symbolic in Lacans terms    Pretense presupposes taking the other into account it therefore supposes simultaneously the pretense of pretensea simple supplementary move by the other within the strategy of the game That supplementarity is at work from the moment of the first pretense23 The distinction between the inscription of the trace and its era sure as the means by which to juridically separate the human from animal fares no better As Derrida argues in that same essayand this is why so long ago I substituted the concept of trace for that of signi language r epr esentation and species fier he begins by sayingthe structure of the trace presupposes that to trace amounts to erasing a trace as much as to imprinting it    How can it be denied that the simple substitution of one trace for another the marking of their diacritical difference in the most elementary inscriptionwhich capacity Lacan concedes to the animalinvolves erasure as much as it involves the imprint It is as difficult to assign a frontier between pretense and pretense of pretense to have an indivis ible line pass through the middle of a feigned feint as it is to assign one between inscription and erasure of the trace 137 first italics mine The point here as Derrida argues is less a matter of asking whether one has the right to refuse the animal such and such a power    than of asking whether what calls itself human has the right to rigorously attribute to man    what he refuses the animal and whether he can ever possess the pure rigorous indivisible concept as such of that at tribution Thus were we even to supposesomething I am not ready to concedethat the animal were incapable of covering its tracks by what right could one concede that power to the human to the subject of the signifier 138 What Derrida helps us to seeand we can only see it if we have the taste for paradoxical formulations that Dennett suggests we ignoreis that just because a particular discourse operates within pa rameters and conventions that we think of as scientific or presents itself as a materialist rendering of the problem of consciousness in rela tion to embodiment does not mean that the discourse is not meta physical As a methodological consideration for such a discourse language appears as a rather unimportant secondorder phenomenon whose job is to be as transparent as possible to the concepts and beyond that the objects it represents which is why the eventual goal for materialistic reductionism can be to eliminate language altogether At the same time paradoxically this apparently insubstantial thing called language constitutes the phenomenological and indeed ontological and ethical divide between human and nonhuman subjectivity paradoxically it constitutes the phenomenological specificity of the very being who then in an idealist abstraction if ever there was one rises above it to deploy it literally at willor in Dennetts terms by intention Indeed what Derrida writes about Austin and speech act theory in Signature Event Context applies even more pointedly to the language r epr esentation and species recovery and maintenance of the humanist subject in Dennett as what Derrida there calls a free consciousness present to the totality of the operation and of absolutely meaningful speech vouloirdire master of itself the teleological jurisdiction of an entire field whose organiz ing center remains intentionan intention that expresses itself for instance in the difference between pretending and pretending to pre tend thinking and knowing youre thinking and so on24 And this as we will see in multiple contexts throughout the next two chapters has farreaching consequences for the rigor and objectivity of the knowl edge that we think we can have of ourselves and of other nonhuman beings a rigor and objectivity that analytical philosophy and cogni tive science have typically reserved for themselves over and against the merely epistemological quandaries of poststructuralist philosophy For as Derrida points out it is not certain that what we call language or speech acts can ever be exhaustively determined by an objective sci ence or theory indeed it is more scientific to take this limit    into account and to treat it as a point of departure for rethinking this or that received concept of science and of objectivity25 All of this might be viewed as merely theoretical if you like were it not for the fact that Dennett himself insists that the ethical stakes of determining which creatures have mindsa determination that de pends in turn on a specific relation to languageare dire indeed On the one hand Dennett argues that the ethical course is to err on the side of overattribution just to be safe when considering the possibility of nonhuman minds because the ethical consequences of being niggardly and then later being found wrong could be grave26 At the same time however he writes It may not be able to talk but surely it thinks one of the main aims of this book has been to shake your confidence in this familiar reaction 159 But because a deeply flawed theory of talking is central to a representationalist notion of thinking in Dennetts work and because only things that think that is to say both think and know they are thinking have minds and because only things that have minds and we might add know they have minds merit ethical consid eration Dennett is forced to embrace ethical implications that despite his generous gestures to the contrary would seem to run counter to the supposed point of his entire project which is to take seriously the statusepistemologically and ethicallyof different kinds of minds language r epr esentation and species Take for example Dennetts rendering of the difference between pain and suffering which unwittingly reproduces the very Cartesianism that Dennett has time and again declared the enemy Dennett writes that we might well think that the capacity for suffering counts for more in any moral calculations than the capacity for abstruse and sophisticated reasoning 16227 But on this point Dennett follows Descartes almost to the letter Descarteswho is often misunderstood on this pointinsisted not that animals do not feel those sensations we call pain but only that they do not experience them as suffering because there is no one home no subject of the cogito to do the experiencing and thus the pain is not morally relevant28 Similarly Dennett argues that for such states to matterwhether or not we call them pains or conscious states or experiencesthere must be an enduring subject to whom they matter because they are a source of suffering 161 My point here of course is not that human and nonhuman ani mals all experience the same kinds or levels of suffering even the most ardent animal rights philosophers such as Peter Singer agree that they do not29 My point is that the difference between pain and suffer ing in Dennett turns out to be not just a difference in degree but a difference in kind an ontological difference one that simply reproduces on another level the difference between thinking and knowing youre thinking having thoughts and having represented thoughts and so on30 The problem in other words is with the unwitting Cartesianism of Dennetts enduring subject which in turn leads him not surpris ingly to embrace some ethical conclusions that should I think give us pause For example when Dennett attempts to draw out the ethical consequences of his contention that human consciousness    is a nec essary condition for serious suffering 165 he ends up suggesting that a dissociated child does not suffer as much as a nondissociated child 164 And just as different forms of being human in the world are re written as they are here in terms of a homogeneous Cartesian ideal so nonhuman beings in all their diversity are now rendered not as fully complete forms of life that are radically irreducible to such a thin idealized account of what counts as subjectivity but rather as dimin ished or crippled versions of that fantasy figure called the humanthe Cartesian cogito now rewritten as the userillusion qua enduring sub ject Nonhuman animals are now seen as creatures that are naturally language r epr esentation and species dissociatedthat never achieve or even attempt to achieve the sort of complex internal organization that is standard in a normal child and disrupted in a dissociated child 164 The problem here is not the ethical foregrounding of pain and suffering The problem is that Dennetts ontological distinction be tween pain and suffering is based on a set of phantom abilities an chored by but not limited to language and its imagined representa tional capacities in relation to the world of things that no subject either nonhuman or human possesses in fact I will return to these issues in much greater detail in the next chapter but for the moment we can get an even sharper sense of this by reference to Derridas very different approach to the question of nonhuman suffering which takes place ironically enough by way of the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham who anchors the animal rights philosophy of Peter Singer The relevant question here Bentham asserts is not can they talk or can they reason but can they suffer For Derrida putting the question in this way changes everything because from Aristotle to Descartes from Descartes especially to Heidegger Levinas and Lacanand we might add to Dennettposing the question of the animal in terms of the capacity for either thought or language deter mines so many others concerning power or capability pouvoirs and attributes avoirs being able having the power to give to die to bury ones dead to dress to work to invent a technique31 What makes Benthams reframing of the problem so powerful is that now the ques tion is disturbed by a certain passivity    a notbeingable What of the vulnerability felt on the basis of this inability Derrida continues what is this nonpower at the heart of power    What right should be accorded it To what extent does it concern us It concerns us di rectly in fact for mortality resides there as the most radical means of thinking the finitude that we share with animals the mortality that belongs to the very finitude of life to the experience of compassion32 From this vantageto return now to the story with which we beganwe can derive from the exploits of Rico the Uberpooch an un expected lesson whose ethical as well as epistemological resonance we are now in a position to appreciate that even though thinking about the consciousness intelligence and emotional and mental lives of nonhuman animals in terms of their linguistic abilities has historically language r epr esentation and species been a crucial means for getting such questions on the table at all33 it may not be the best way and it is certainly not the only way of ap proaching these questions Indeedand I will explore this point on a much broader canvas in my discussion of Temple Grandin in chapter 5 Ricos prodigious signifying abilities may be only one sign among many others and only the one most readily legible to us as language dependent creatures of a thinking if thats what we want to call it that we ought to be interested in not because it is a diminished or dim approximation of ours but because it is part of a very different way of being in the world that calls on us to rethink ever anew and vigilantly so what we mean by person mind consciousnessthat entire cluster of terms and the ethical implications that flow from them In this light as Derrida suggests It would not be a matter of giving speech back to animals but perhaps of acceding to a thinking however fabu lous and chimerical it might be that thinks the absence of the name and of the word otherwise as something other than a privation34 What I am suggesting here is that your theory of language mat ters and it matters not just epistemologically as well see in chapter 3 or methodologically chapter 4 because all sorts of consequences both ontological and ethical follow in its wakeconsequences that I have here tried to draw out on the terrain of the question of species differ ence and the question of subjectivity But I am also suggesting that there is an interdisciplinary imperative we need to undertake when ad dressing such complex questions If it is true that cognitive science has an enormous amount to contribute to the area of philosophy that we used to call phenomenologyif it has even in a way taken it over then it is also true that the textually oriented humanities have much to teach cognitive science about what language is and isnt and how that in turn bears on any possible philosophy of the subject human or animal This is simply to say that it will take all hands on deck I think to fully comprehend what amounts to a new reality that the human occupies a new place in the universe a universe now populated by what I am prepared to call nonhuman subjects And this is why to me post humanism means not the triumphal surpassing or unmasking of some thing but an increase in the vigilance responsibility and humility that accompany living in a world so newly and differently inhabited This page intentionally left blank Flesh and Finitude Bioethics and the Philosophy of the Living But who me jacques derrida Limited Inc Bioethics Inc What is bioethics now With what questions is it properly concerned And how is its ability to address those questions predisposed or fore closed by a certain set of theoretical and philosophical commitments To ask the question What can bioethics be thinking is to raise the question of not just its institutional norms which are powerfully vested indeed but also its philosophical norms In that light I will make the case that bioethics in its dominant mode of practice needs to undertake what one recent philosopher calls following Wittgenstein a gram matical redescription1 of its chosen domain if it is to more fully and responsibly address the bio of bioethicsthe question of what Derrida calls simply but not so simply the living in general2 At stake here is not just a style of doing philosophy but more important who and what can count as a subject of ethical address And from this vantage one of the central ironies of bioethics in its dominant institu tionalized form is that it is subtended by a certain notion of the human that remainsdespite wave after wave of changes in our understand ing of the bio of bioethicsnot only uninterrogated but indeed re trenched and nowhere more clearly or more predictably than in the confidence with which the boundary between human and nonhuman animals is taken for granted as an ethical nonissuethe very differ ence ironically enough that would seem thrown completely open to question by the very biotechnical and scientific developments with which contemporary bioethics is so concerned I make no pretense at giving anything like a complete picture flesh and finitude of contemporary bioethics but I can at least provide a snapshot with reference to one or two of its bestknown practitioners A glance at the table of contents of one of the leading textbooks in the field the col lection Contemporary Issues in Bioethics edited by Tom Beauchamp and LeRoy Walters will give at least some sense of the sorts of issues that occupy the field 1 patientprofessional relationships with particular focus on patients rights and specific patient populations this last including essays on involuntary hospitalization of the mentally ill medicine in an aging society and caring for socially undesirable patients among others 2 management of medical information with essays focusing on issues of confidentiality and the law patient selfdetermination informed consent and the truthful disclosure of bad news to patients and families 3 abortion and maternalfetal relations with essays debating the moral and legal aspects of abortion and the rights of mothers to pursue or decline various types of treat ment 4 euthanasia and assisted suicide including legal aspects of the patients refusal of treatment voluntary active euthanasia as well as physicianassisted suicide and a concluding pair of essays about the right to die 5 justice in the distribution of health care which leads off a section on access to health care here the reader will find essays on managed care and universal access and healthcare rationing 6 biomedical research and technology with essays predominantly on ethical issues and past abuses in human research subjects and a smaller section on ethical issues in animal research 7 eugenics and human genetics including essays on eugenics programs in the twentieth cen tury including Nazi Germany and population control in China a suite on the Human Genome Project and another on human gene therapy and genetic enhancement 8 a section on reproductive technologies and surrogate parenting arrangements including infertility in vitro fertilization cloning and regulating assisted reproduction and 9 public health and the global AIDS epidemic with sections on the duty to warn and not to harm testing and screening programs and issues in clinical research on HIVAIDS3 Of particular interest here too are the particular sorts of docu ments and authors included To be sure one finds the usual academic essay in abundance but roughly 25 to 30 percent of the contributions are from legal corporate governmental or professional organizations or bodies We find for example the American Medical Associations Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs contributing a document titled Fundamental Elements of the PatientPhysician Relationship v the American Hospital Association providing A Patients Bill of Rights vi contributions by the Presidents Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry the Council of Europe the World Medical Association and similar bodies and a large number of legal documents and rulings by the Court of Appeals of both the United States and the District of Columbia Supreme Courts of both the United States and California and various branches of state and federal government All of which raises a question that goes to the very heart of contemporary bioethics the question of codification which involves as Derrida flesh and finitude them There has been a parallel shift in the right of death or at least a tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a lifeadministering power and to define itself accordingly This death that was based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure maintain or develop its life by means of a power that exerts a positive influence on life that endeavors to administer optimize and multiply it subjecting it to pre cise controls and comprehensive regulations5 As Foucault puts it in one of the more important passages in all of his later work one worth quoting at length This was nothing less than the entry of life into history that is the entry of phenomena peculiar to the life of the human species into the order of knowledge and power into the sphere of political techniques It is not a question of claiming that this was the moment when the first contact between life and history was brought about On the contrary the pressure exerted by the biological on the historical had remained very strong for thousands of years epidemics and famine were the two great dramatic forms of this relationship that was always dominated by the menace of death But through a circular process the economic and primarily agriculturaldevelopment of the eighteenth century and an increase in productivity and resources    allowed a measure of relief from these profound threats despite some renewed outbreaks the period of great ravages from starvation and plague had come to a close before the French Revolution death was ceasing to torment life so directly    Western man was gradually learning what it meant to be a living species in a living world to have a body conditions of exis tence probabilities of life an individual and collective welfare forces that could be modified and a space in which they could be distributed in an optimal manner For the first time in history no doubt biological existence was reflected in political existence 264 Within this general historical shift and mutation in the forms of power comprising modern society the areas of health and what will come to be called the biomedical take on new politically central roles directly linked to the reproduction of both the state and capitalist rela tions 263 Such a power Foucault continues has to qualify mea sure appraise and hierarchize rather than display itself in its murder ous splendor    The judicial institution is increasingly incorporated into a continuum of apparatuses medical administrative and so on whose functions are for the most part regulatory 266 In this con text he argues the emergence of the health and physical wellbeing of the population in general becomes one of the essential objectives of political power which focuses on how to raise the level of health of the social body as a whole Different power apparatuses are called upon to take charge of bodies not simply to exact blood service from them or levy dues but to help and if necessary constrain them to en sure their own good health The imperative of health at once the duty of each and the objective of all6 Not surprisingly then Medicine as a general technique of health even more than as a ser vice to the sick or an art of cures assumes an increasingly important place in the administrative system and the machinery of powera role which is constantly widened and strengthened throughout the eighteenth century The doctor wins a footing within the different in stances of social power The administration acts as a point of support and sometimes a point of departure for the great medical inquiries into the health of populations and conversely doctors devote an increas ing amount of their activity to tasks both general and administrative assigned to them by power A medicoadministrative knowledge be gins to develop concerning society its health and sickness its condi tions of life housing and habits which serves as the basic core for the social economy and sociology of the nineteenth century And there is likewise constituted a politicomedical hold on a population hedged in by a whole series of prescriptions relating not only to disease but to general forms of existence and behavior7 As even a cursory glance at the table of contents of Contemporary Issues in Bioethics suggests bioethics as it is currently institutionalized represents something like the apotheosis of this medicoadministrative edifice and its dense imbrication in contemporary apparatuses and institutions of state and economic power serving as it were as its selfdesignated conscience The obvious problem with this is that the functions of conscience and those of establishing policies palatable to both state and economic power do not always or even often go hand in hand and while there may be precious few compulsions on the side of conscience for the field of bioethics there is no shortage of them on the side of policy Indeed professional bioethicists routinely cultivate flesh and finitude relations with the biomedical research industry and its university liai sons that would seem to mitigate against the kind of skepticism and autonomy that the role of selfdesignated conscience would demand8 Of course practicing bioethicists would be the first to say that they must do this if they are not to be cut out of the decisionmaking process about biomedical research policy altogetherbut that simply proves the point that in contemporary bioethics the tail does indeed wag the dog in an arrangement that one critic calls Real Ethik To simply declare certain procedures such as human cloning immoral and call for an immediate and permanent ban is to ignore brazenly the history of technology one lesson of which might fairly be summarized as If it can be done it will be done This dictates what one bioethicist calls a pragmatic approach to bioethics in which for example we are wasting our time huffing and puffing about an international ban on human cloning Get over it he asserts its not going to happen9 Of course such a positionwhich might be characterized as dropping the pretense that the fox is not guarding the chicken coop might well be a cause for concern and some of it has come from within the community of bioethicists themselves Carl Elliott who is con cerned to make the field more philosophically nuanced and responsive to the real complexities it faces puts it this way If the occupational hazard of philosophy is uselessness that of medicine is an unthink ing pragmatism When bioethics is driven solely by clinical concerns usually those of the hospital it runs the danger of getting stuck in a permanent feedback loop in which the same issues are discussed again and again    Constrained by the demand for immediately useful an swers clinical ethics at its worst at any rate comes dangerously close to being a purely technical enterprise carried out in isolation from any kind of deep reflection about the examined life It will come as no surprise then as Elliott puts it that the law is the lingua franca of bio ethics The language in which bioethics is discussed revolves around largely quasilegal notions such as consent competence rights to re fuse treatment to have an abortion and so on Many writers have tar geted the language of rights and autonomy for special criticism    But I also think that the laws influence on bioethics has been much deeper and more subtle It has given us a picture of morality as some how like the law in structure10 the point The collection is fronted by an opening section on ethical theory at whose core lies a section titled Ethical Principles of which in the authors view there are three primary ones respect for au tonomy beneficence and justice11 The first emerging from an essentially Kantian view of the person as end and not means is de fined as freedom from external constraint and the presence of criti cal mental capacities such as understanding intending and voluntary decisionmaking capacity a picture of the subject drawn from the liberal philosophical tradition that we will have ample opportunity to scrutinize later In this view if autonomy is to be limited it is only because it conflicts with one or both of the other two principles be neficence which is defined as the active promotion of good kindness and charity including the core directive primum non nocere above all do no harm 20 and the principle of justice which the authors define in the following way Common to all theories of justice is a minimal beginning principle Like cases should be treated alike or to use the language of equality equals ought to be treated equally and unequals unequally In bioethics this principle tends to take the form of a focus on distributive justice the fair equitable and appropriate distribu tion    of primary social goods such as economic goods and funda mental political rights 22 including access to various kinds of health care the ability to pay for such access and so on12 As Elliott points out these kinds of discussions take a fairly pre dictable form in which bioethicists conventionally take concepts like person and define or redefine them so that they can be strictly and consistently applied Once language is thus refined we will know how words should be used and thus how we should act13 Elliott continues This way of reasoning says we can figure out what to do in this case if we can just get straight about what a person is That is we know how to treat a person so if we decide that this marginal being is a persona fetus an anencephalic or a neurologically damaged adultor say a primate used in biomedical researchthen a conclusion about how we should morally treat that marginal being will logically follow 159 But the problem here from Elliotts point of view is the notion that we can somehow define what a person is apart from our moral at titudes towards persons and that once we get the definition right this flesh and finitude will tell us what our moral attitudes should be 159 But this is not the way our moral grammar works he argues in fact just the oppo site Our moral attitudes are not grounded by a theory of persons they are built into our language Part of what we mean by the word person entails a certain moral attitude 160 And when Elliott says moral grammar here he means it in a specifically Wittgensteinian sense as in Wittgensteins wellknown statement that to imagine a language is to imagine a form of life14 And equally Wittgensteinian is Elliotts contention that bioethics generally if implicitly assumes its subject matter to be questions of conduct and sometimes character    It does not conventionally consider questions about the sense or mean ing of life and it considers only in very awkward constructions such as quality of life those questions about what makes life worth living These are ultimate questions about the framework against which our judgments of value get their sense but they are for the most part ab sent or at least hidden in mainstream bioethics15 To put it another way it may be that the pragmatism of Real Ethik in bioethics dictates shifting from policies of stark authorizationpro hibition to a web of regulation and incentives from ultimatums to real diplomacy from grandstanding to nuance and compromise16but in the name of what exactly against what background to use the Wittgensteinian term The answer typically given by bioethics is to maximize the general social welfare and to minimize harm17 but as we shall see and as Elliott has already suggested this reply begs all sorts of questions not the least of which is how it can be distinguished from a simple appeal to social norms and more pointedly the preju dices and pragmatic expediencies on which such consensus is based Of these prejudices none is more symptomatic of the current state of bio ethics than prejudice based on species difference and an incapacity to address the ethical issues raised by dramatic changes over the past thirty years in our knowledge about the lives communication emotions and consciousness of a number of nonhuman speciesa prejudice that bio ethics shares with the very core of a centuriesold humanism that con temporary bioethics and its scifi scenarios appear but only appear to have always already left behind18 This is entirely to the point for the field of contemporary bioethics of course simply because millions of animals are used in the area of biomedical research each year19 Elliotts observation about moral attitudes not being grounded by a theory of persons but rather built into our language is perfectly exemplified by the bioethicist Arthur Caplans attempt to confront or evade the question of our obligations to nonhuman animals espe cially those used in biomedical research in a recent essay on the ethical complexities of xenotransplantation using animal organs for trans plantation into humans I choose Caplan not because he is an easy mark a retrograde voice in the field quite the contrary he is in many ways one of its more progressive voices And he is certainly one of its most visible in addition to running the University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics he is a regular columnist for MSNBC and appears regularly in the major media as the designated expert in contemporary bioethics Caplans essay Is the Use of Animal Organs for Transplants Immoral puts on display exactly the kind of confusion that Elliott objects to and on every page evinces the kind of contamination of eth ics by pragmatic expediency and ethnocentrism that is the hallmark of the Real Ethik of contemporary bioethics20 At the core of the essay Caplan argues that it is acceptable to use some animals even primates to demonstrate the feasibility of xenografting in human beings and that this is so for a familiar set of reasons First he argues that the differences in the capacities and abilities of humans and primates he lists the familiar litany language tool use rationality intentional ity and so on justify a different moral status He concedes that all of these are found in nonhuman species but he asserts that humans are capable of a much broader range of behavior and intellectual function ing than is any other primate species and that therefore humans and nonhuman animals are not moral equivalents21 One might well begin by observing that there is a fundamental slippage here that needs to be clarified before we can make any real headway on this question As even the most famous animal rights phi losopher on the planet Peter Singer has argued the question is not and has never been whether humans and nonhuman animals are the same morally As Singer puts it the issue is not saying that all lives are of equal worth or that all interests of humans and other animals are to be given equal weight no matter what those interests may be It is saying that where animals and humans have similar interestswe flesh and finitude might take the interest in avoiding physical pain as an example for it is an interest that humans clearly share with other animalsthose inter ests are to be counted equally with no automatic discount just because one of the beings is not human22 A further problem with Caplans position is that it is open to the objection by means of what is often called the argument from mar ginal cases As the philosopher Paola Cavalieri puts it Concretely it is not true that all human beings possess the attributes that allegedly mark the difference between us and the other animals It is undeni able that there exist within our species individuals who on account of structural problems due to genetic or developmental anomalies or of contingent problems due to diseases or accidents will never acquire or have forever lost the characteristicsautonomy rationality self consciousness and the likethat we consider as typically human23 This objection also undermines Caplans second point Human be ings can be ethical he writes They may act this way only rarely and some may never do so but we are creatures capable of moral activ ity and moral responsibility Humans can be moral agents while ani mals even other primates are moral subjects24 As we have just seen however even if this assertion is true of nonhuman animals it is cer tainly not true of all human beingsnamely those marginal cases just referenced And yet we refrain from using them to harvest organs while we do so with other animals who are demonstrably superior in relevant moral characteristics Moreover as Cavalieri points out a position such as Caplans rests on a fundamental slippage between the question of moral agents and moral patients This view may appear plausible she writes but is in fact ambiguous It can indeed mean two different things a that only rational and autonomous beings can be morally respon sible or b that only what is done to rational and autonomous beings has moral weight As Cavalieri puts it If the moral agent is a being whose behavior may be subject to moral evaluation the moral patient is a being whose treatment may be subject to moral evaluation25 From this vantage it is irrelevant as Caplan puts it that animals are inca pable of being held to account for what they do since the fundamental issue here is not their behavior but rather our treatment of them One might say the same after all of a human being suffering from severe schizophrenia or a small child or an elderly person suffering from Alzheimers disease and so on Caplans final line of defense in response to the marginalcases problem is perhaps the most telling and disturbing of all The reason that even the severely retarded or permanently comatose person should not be used in the same research in which we use a more fully endowed great ape has nothing to do with the properties capacities and abilities of chil dren or infants who lack and have always lacked significant degrees of intellectual and cognitive function The reason they should not be used is because of the impact using them would have upon other human be ings    The assessment of the morals of how we treat each other and animals does not hinge simply on the properties that each possesses Relationships must enter into the equation as well and when they do the balance begins to tip toward human rather than animal interests when there is a conflict26 The problem with this position of course is twofold at least Ethically speaking it is a not even thinly disguised appeal to ethnocentrism and prejudice under the cover term relationsin this case prejudice on the basis of species membership and logically speaking it is utterly circular As for the first this appeal to relational rather than individ ual characteristics though it seems commonsensical and clearheaded enough is in fact ethically pernicious and just how pernicious is re vealed by a little experiment that Cavalieri conducts with it in her book The Animal Question First she quotes the same relational position held by Caplanthis time from the work of Robert Nozick Perhaps it will turn out Nozick contends that the bare species characteristic of simply being human    will com mand special respect only from other humansthis is an instance of the general principle that the members of any species may legitimately give their fellows more weight than they give members of other species or at least more weight than a neutral view would grant them Lions too if they were moral agents could not then be criticized for putting other lions first27 But what is revealed about this position Cavalieri asks if we plug in other terms instead flesh and finitude white    will command special respect only from other whitesthis is an instance of the general principle that the members of any race may legitimately give their fellows more weight than they give members of other races or at least more weight than a neutral view would grant them Blacks too    could not then be criticized for putting other blacks first 80 Caplan may want to fall back on the view that says that we are powerful and the primates are less so therefore they must yield to human purposes This line of response he contends is far removed from the kinds of arguments that should be mustered in the name of morality28 But the point here is that in reality that is the kind of argu ment Caplan is making As Tom Regan puts it Might according to this theory does make right Let those who are the victims of injustice suffer as they will It matters not so long as no one else    cares about it    As if for example there would be nothing wrong with apartheid in South Africa if few white South Africans were upset by it29 In more strictly philosophical terms at the core of this position is a fundamental selfdefeating confusion familiar to us since Humes Law which insists on the distinction between facts and values that what ought to be cannot be derived from what is30 Caplan doesnt just confuse the question what ought we to do with the question what are people likely to do he in fact subordinates the former to the latter In doing so bioethics becomes little more than the status quo with apologies Moreoverto return to my second pointit is not just that the position is ethnocentric it is also circular to wit we care about being X because we think of them as persons and we think of them as persons because we care about them But what is needed here of course is a disarticulation of the question of persons from the ques tion of membership in the species Homo sapiens And from this vantage the Wittgensteinian point about moral attitudes being built into our language is not some sort of positivism though it is sometimes under stood that way that holds that we should simply take for granted what we mean by persons On the contrary it suggests that we should be extraordinarilyindeed philosophicallyattuned to how forms of language what we say what we write how we ask philosophical questions open up certain lines of thoughtindeed the imagining of whole worldsand foreclose others From this point of view it is precisely the ungroundedness of what is meant by persons to take the example at hand that requires our dili gence about how philosophical questions are formulated In this light what becomes clear is that the philosophical impoverishment of bio ethics overdeterminesor perhaps we should say leaves undisturbed its ethical parochialism So when Caplan asks if it is ethical to use ani mals in research to study the feasibility of crossspecies xenografting and responds that in part the answer to this question pivots on whether or not there are plausible alternative models to the use of animals31 it is obvious that the question ostensibly being asked has already been decided since the question is really not can we consider using them but simply under what pragmatic circumstances Beyond Rights So far I have been responding to the shortcomings of bioethics in its own termsthat is to say the terms of analytical philosophy and what is sometimes called its justice tradition As I hope I have shown far too hastily Im afraid even in its own terms it is woefully inadequateboth ethically and philosophicallyfor confronting the complex questions of life death and our relations to other living beings that far exceed what bioethics currently constitutes as its unified field At this juncture we might move in one of two directions Along one tack we might remain within the purview of the analytical tradition and work more diligently to apply it consistently and dispassionately to the questions just raised which is essentially what we find in the work of Cavalieri Regan and Singer Conversely we might shift to another way of doing philosophy altogether one that has a very different notion of the relationship be tween the practice of philosophy and the kinds of questions that animate or ought to animate bioethics I want to explore both options here with the eventual aim of showing how the limitations of the analytic tradition for confronting these questions pivot on a certain understanding of the relationship between language philosophical concepts and subjectivity that shortcircuits our ability to think questions of ethics in relation to the living with the kind of subtlety and rigor they demand flesh and finitude Before moving to that part of my argument however I want to look briefly at one of the more recent attempts within the analytic tradition to redress some of the problems we have already discussed Martha Nussbaums use of an Aristotelian framework in Frontiers of Justice Disability Nationality Species Membership 2006 My concern here will be to show the limits of philosophical humanism for think ing about the status of nonhuman beings and our relations and duties to them which stems in part from its inability to locate the question properly More specifically if philosophical work that takes the moral status of nonhuman animals seriously is in some obvious sense post humanist in the sense that its want to challenge the ontological and ethical divide between humans and nonhumans is itself a linchpin of philosophical humanism such work may still be quite humanist on an internal theoretical and methodological level that recontains and even undermines an otherwise admirable philosophical project a point Ill return to in the next chapter So what I will try to do here is map a kind of philosophical or theoretical spectrum that moves from humanist approaches to posthumanism or antianthropocentrism to posthumanist approaches to posthumanism And my point here will be not to pursue a kind of moreposthumanistthanthou sweepstakes but to bring out in a detailed way how the admirable impulses be hind any variety of philosophy that challenges anthropocentrism and speciesismimpulses that I respect wherever they may be found demand a certain reconfiguration of what philosophy or theory is and how it can and cannot respond to the challenge that all the phi losophers discussed here want to engage the challenge of sharing the planet with nonhuman subjects and treating them justly Such differences should not obscure a remarkable fact with which Id like to begin that figures as diverse as Nussbaum Cora Diamond and Jacques Derrida all set out from the same starting point that an chors our ethical response to nonhuman animals namely how our shared embodiment mortality and finitude make us as Diamond puts it fellow creatures in ways that subsume the more traditional markers of ethical consideration such as the capacity for reason the ability to enter into contractual agreements or reciprocal behaviors and so onmarkers that have traditionally created an ethical divide between Homo sapiens and everything or everyone else Peter Singer might be added to the list as well for Singer more than thirty years ago in Animal Liberation drew attention to a passage buried as Paola Cavalieri has reminded us in a footnote in Jeremy Benthams Intro duction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation that also serves re markably enough as a crucial locus for Derridas later work on the question of the animal32 What else is it that should trace the insu perable line Bentham asks Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse But a fullgrown horse or dog is beyond com parison a more rational as well as a more conversable animal than an infant of a day or a week or even a month old But suppose the case were otherwise what would it avail The question is not Can they reason nor Can they talk but Can they suffer33 For Singer as well as for Derrida Benthams passagewith its rejection of the relevance of talk and the faculty of discourse as an ethically decisive difference between humans and nonhumansmarks a signal advance beyond the wellknown political animal passage in Aristotle which as Derrida has noted inaugurates an entire philosophical tradition of thinking the difference between human and nonhuman animals in terms of the humans ability to properly respond to its world rather than merely react to it an ability made possible so the story goes by language We will return to this point in some detail later but for the mo ment it is worth quoting Aristotle by way of contrast Now that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other gregarious animals is evident Aristotle writes Nature as we often say makes nothing in vain and man is the only ani mal whom she has endowed with the gift of speech And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure or pain and is therefore found in other animals for their nature attains to the perception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one another and no further the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and inexpedient and therefore likewise the just and the unjust34 Bentham shifts the focus however to the fact that the capacity for suffering as Singer puts it is not just another characteristic like the capacity for language or higher mathematics    The capacity for suf fering and enjoyment he continues is a prerequisite for having interests at all a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests flesh and finitude in a meaningful way35 Now one might think that the question of suf fering and more broadly of finitude and mortality that links us with nonhuman animals would be a rather philosophically straightforward matter but as we shall see exactly the opposite is the case In fact this question will be handled in different and even opposed ways by Singer Nussbaum Diamond and finally Derridadifferences that will be de finitive for understanding the difference between what I am calling humanist and posthumanist approaches to the question of nonhuman and human animal life Nussbaum for example asserts that utilitarianism has contrib uted more than any other ethical theory to the recognition of animal suffering as evil but she rejects Singers utilitarian view for many of the same reasons outlined by among others Tom Regan in The Case for Animal Rights 1983 For her not only is its sumranking of in terests problematic but it is also in a fundamental way beside the point of justice per se As for the first charge because the core utilitar ian principle is the greatest good for the greatest number of interest holding beings of whatever species in Singers scheme utilitarianism seems to have no way to rule out on grounds of basic justice the great pain and cruel treatment of at least some animals whose treat ment in a circus say might be justified on the grounds that the suf fering of ten or twenty animals brings greater pleasure on balance to hundreds of thousands of human beings As Regan summarizes the problem succinctly The victims pleasures and pains carry no more moral weight than the equal pleasures and pains of anyone else To count his pleasures or pains more heavily is ruled out by the egalitari anism claimed as one of the virtues of classical utilitarianism36 The problem in other wordsand this is Nussbaums second pointis that utilitarianism provides no way for animals to be direct subjects of jus tice It seems that the best reason to be against slavery torture and lifelong subordination she writes is a reason of justice not an em pirical calculation of total or average wellbeing that might or might not entail the maltreatment of a particular sentient being37 Moreover and again the point is articulated in great detail by Regan38 the derivation of fundamental interests from the principle of suffering is itself problematic for as Nussbaum at when we consider the entitlements of animals It seems plausible to think that there may be goods they pursue that are not felt as pain and frustration when they are absent And the reverse is true as well for example in the pain involved in the effort required to master a dif ficult activity 345 As an alternative Nussbaum argues not for the contractarian or social contract view promoted by John Rawls whose limitations in this case ought to be obvious enough39 but for the capabilities approach that she derives from Aristotle Now it may seem odd that Aristotle would be chosen as a guide in this realm given his decisive separation of humans from nonhuman animals on the basis of speech and rationality As Gary Steiner argues however there is a tension in Aristotles writings between the zoological texts such as History of Animals and Parts of Animals and the psychological metaphysical and ethical works such as On the Soul and the Nicomachean Ethics40 In the zoological texts Aristotle attributes to animals capacities that he treats in the psychological and ethical writings as applying only to human beingscapacities such as character intelligence ingenuity and emo tion and he provides a hint of the interpretation of such attributions when he says that we call the lower animals neither temperate nor selfindulgent except by a metaphor because these have no choice or calculation 71 Steiners position is that for Aristotle clearly there is a cosmic scheme of things and human beings are superior to ani mals in that scheme because only humans possess the contemplative ability that likens us to the gods 60an ability as we have seen decisively linked with reason and with speech Ultimately Steiner writes he is unable to do justice to both sides of the dichotomy be tween the human and animal realms But he may come closer to doing so than any other Western advocate of the superiority of human beings over animals chiefly on the strength of the broader but also specifi cally nonethical context provided by the zoological writings 72 It is this ambiguity in Aristotles position that Nussbaum seizes upon We might say then that Nussbaum tries to do for Aristotle what Regan did for Kant retrofit their theories by rejecting the central role of rationality as an ontological and ethical dividing line between hu mans and nonhuman animals Hence the rather onesided reading if we believe Steiner of Aristotle that we find in Nussbaum flesh and finitude The capabilities approach by contrast sees rationality and animality as thoroughly unified Takings its cue from Aristotles notion of the human being as a political animal    it sees the rational as simply one aspect of the animal and at that not the only one that is pertinent to a notion of a truly human functioning More generally the capabilities approach sees the world as containing many different types of animal dignity all of which deserve respect and even awe The specifically human kind is indeed characterized usually by a kind of rationality but rationality is not idealized and set in opposition to animality it is just gardenvariety practical reasoning which is one way animals have of functioning 159 Moreover she writes the Aristotelian idea of the human as the politi cal animal must receive the proper accentthe political animalso that we properly understand the human being as not just a moral and political being but one who has an animal body and whose human dignity rather than being opposed to this animal nature inheres in it and in its temporal trajectory from cradle to grave which involves long periods and sometimes unexpected modes of dependency and vulnerability as embodied beings 8788 Thus while the capabilities view includes an idea related to the contractarian idea of freedom 88 it by definition rejects the grounding of that freedom in a conception of the person as free equal and independent 87 What is fundamental to the ethical standing of both humans and nonhumansand this is readily brought into focus in animal rights philosophy by the analogy between the situation of nonhuman higher animals and severely disabled human beingsis not the contractarian idea that only those who can join a contract as rough equals can be primary nonderivative subjects of a theory of justice 327 but rather the embodiment and finitude of creatures of whatever species who may be deemed to use Tom Regans term the subject of a life41 As we have already seen this criterion is not reduc ible to sentience and suffering per se nor is the rightness or wrongness of how such beings are treated subject to the sumranking of inter ests that we find in Singers utilitarianism Instead the rightness or wrongness of our treatment of such subjectshuman or nonhuman is in Nussbaums view determined by the extent to which it enables or impedes their flourishing a flourishing that is based on a more or less empirical assessment of the capabilities needs characteristic behaviors and so on of the particular being in question The general aim of the capabilities approach in charting political principles to shape the humananimal relationship she writes would be that no sentient animal should be cut off from the chance for a flourishing life a life with the type of dignity relevant to that species and that all sentient animals should enjoy certain positive opportunities to flourish42 At this juncture it would be possibleindeed were I an ana lytic philosopher it might be imperativeto point out some of the many problems with Nussbaums approach even within the purview of its own terms For example it is not clear that it marks any advance over Regans rights position as articulated nearly twentyfive years ago with which it shares several core features the rejection of utilitarian sumranking and of its abstraction of interests from the beings who hold them as mere receptacles the rejection of contractarian theo ries the assertion that nonhuman animals may be direct subjects of jus tice and not just indirect or derivative ones and most important the nearly complete overlap of Nussbaums account of beings capable of flourishing with Regans subjectofalife43 In fact Regans view would seem to avoid two fundamental problems that plague the latter twothirds of Nussbaums treatment of the animal question where she attempts to draw out the conclusions of her view first the problem of determining what counts as human flourishing does it include hunting the exercise of evolutionary predatory instincts the right to procreate to the point of overpopulation and so on44 and second the unavoidability given her position of falling into precisely what she criticizes in the utilitarians namely the problem of balancing competing rights to flourishing human and nonhuman just as the utilitarians must rank competing interests Indeed what we might characterize as the methodological mini malism of both Singers account of interests and Regans of the subject ofalife is calculated to avoid what Geoffrey Harpham calls the human essentialism that plagues Nussbaums later work where Aristotle is called on as the first thinker to try and pick out those features of human life most distinctive of humanity and therefore most worth cultivat ing But missing from the inventory of acceptable human passions Harpham flesh and finitude that are in a sense dispassionate and responsive to the patient work of philosophy are to be considered part of the human essence the rest are merely constructed by social evaluations45 Most problematic of all here of course is the notorious List of Central Human Functional Capabilities that shows up regularly in Nussbaums later work46 It includes capabilities such as being able to move freely from place to place having ones bodily boundaries treated as sovereign    having opportunities for sexual satisfaction    Being able to use the senses to imagine think and reasonand to do these things in a truly human way    Being able to search for the ultimate meaning of life in ones own way Being able to have pleasurable experiences and to avoid non necessary pain    Being able to experience longing gratitude and justified anger and so forth As Harpham Elizabeth Costello is hauntedwounded to use a figure that Cora Diamond highlightsby how we treat nonhuman animals in practices such as factory farming a systemized and mechanized killing that she compares to the consternation of some in its scale and its violence to the Holocaust of the Jews during World War II At a dinner after one of her invited public lectures she is asked by the president of the uni versity whether her vegetarianism comes out of moral conviction and she responds against the expectations of her hosts No I dont think so    It comes out of a desire to save my soul And when the university administrator politely replies Well I have a great respect for it she retorts impatiently Im wearing leather shoes Im carrying a leather purse I wouldnt have overmuch respect if I were you49 What haunts Costello here also torments another of Coetzees characters David Lurie in the novel Disgrace Lurie a literature profes sor in South Africa whose career ends abruptly after he has an affair with a female undergraduate and is charged with sexual harassment moves to the country where his daughter Lucy has a small farm and begins volunteering at the local animal shelter where he assists in euthanizing the scores of animals mainly dogs for whom no homes can be found Lurie has never thought of himself as a sentimentalist as he puts it and he takes to the work reluctantly But then gradually he becomes absorbed in it He had thought he would get used to it Coetzee writes But that is not what happens The more killings he assists in the more jittery he gets Then one Sunday night as he is driving back from the clinic it hits him He actually has to stop at the roadside to recover himself Tears flow down his face that he cannot stop his hands shake He does not understand what is happening to him For reasons he doesnt understand his whole being is gripped by what happens in the surgical theatre50 Both characters experience headon the unnerving weight and gravity of our moral responsibilities toward nonhuman animals But both moments insist on something else too something that also in a different way unsettles the very foundations of what we call the human Both moments acknowledge a second kind of unspeakabil ity not only the unspeakability of how we treat animals in practices like factory farming but also the unspeakability of the limits of our own thinking in confronting such a realitythe trauma as Diamond puts flesh and finitude it of experiences in which we take something in reality to be resistant to our thinking it or possibly to be painful in its inexplicability51 Writ large in the terms of the postEnlightenment philosophi cal tradition this is often referred to as the problem of philosophical skepticism and part of what Diamond is interested in pressuring is the extent to which these two questions are or are not the same On this point Diamond draws on the work of Stanley Cavell who has explored the problem of skepticism with remarkable nuance and range over the past forty and more years a body of thought I will revisit in some detail in chapter 7 Working through figures as diverse as Kant Descartes Emerson Wittgenstein Austin and Heidegger among others Cavell has plumbed the consequences of what it means to do philosophy in the wake of what he calls the Kantian settlement with skepticism As Cavell characterizes it in In Quest of the Ordinary To settle with skepticism    to assure us that we do know the existence of the world or rather that what we understand as knowledge is of the world the price Kant asks us to pay is to cede any claim to know the thing in itself to grant human knowledge is not of things as they are in themselves You dontdo youhave to be a romantic to feel some times about that settlement Thanks for nothing52 But if in Cavells reading of Kant reason proves its power to itself over itself 30 by logically deriving the difference between the world of mere appear ances phenomena that we can know and the world of the Ding an sich noumena that our knowledge never touches then we find ourselves in a position that is not just odd but in fact profoundly unsettling for philosophy in a fundamental sense then fails precisely insofar as it suc ceeds We gain knowledge but only to lose the world The question in the wake of skepticism thus becomes what it can mean to continue to do philosophy after philosophy has become in a certain sense impossible One thing it does not mean if we be lieve Diamond is to think that such resistance of the world the difficulty of reality to use the phrase Diamond borrows from John Updike could be dissolved or overcome by ever more ingenious or ac complished propositional arguments ever more refined philosophical concepts or for that matter by the making of lists Indeed to think that it can to mistake the difficulty of philosophy for the difficulty of reality as do the philosophical Reflections published at the end of The Lives of Animals Diamond suggests is to indulge in a deflec tion of a reality that impinges on usbefalls us as Wittgenstein once put itin ways not masterable by the crafting of analytical argu ments That is why for Diamond Elizabeth Costello doesnt offer one in defense of her vegetarianism and it is also why Costello is quick to point to the inconsistency of her own practices with regard to animal products It is that impingement that pressure of reality that over takes David Lurie on the drive back from the clinic He literally does not know what is happening to him he has no reasons for it and he cant explain it And yet it is the most real thing in the world These fundamental challenges for philosophy are sounded out by Cavell in his reading of the philosopher most important to him Ralph Waldo Emerson and I will revisit that relationship in some detail in chapter 9 Emerson writes in his most important essay Experience I take this evanescence and lubricity of all objects which lets them slip through our fingers then when we clutch hardest to be the most unhandsome part of our condition For Cavell this moment regis ters the confrontation with skepticism certainly but it also voices an understanding of how philosophy must change in the wake of that confrontation For the unhandsome here names not just the Kantian Ding an sich but also Cavell writes what happens when we seek to deny the standoffishness of objects by clutching at them which is to say when we conceive thinking say the application of concepts in judgments as grasping something53 When we engage in that sort of deflection we only deepen the abysswhen we clutch hardest between our thinking and the world that we want to understand The opposite of clutching on the other handwhat Cavell calls the most handsome part of our conditionis facing the fact that the demand for unity in our judgments that our deployment of concepts is not the expression of the conditionedness or limitations of our humanness but of the human effort to escape our humanness54 Philosophy can hence no longer be seen as mastery as a kind of clutching or grasping via analytical categories and concepts that seemed for Heidegger a kind of sublimized violencethe kind of violence that Nussbaums critics find on display most egregiously of course in the List55 Rather the duty of thinking is not to deflect but to suffer remember Costellos woundedness what Cavell calls our exposure to the world flesh and finitude to bring out with reference to a poem by Ted Hughes Six Young Men whose last stanza she quotes to open The Difficulty of Reality The poem concerns the uncanny sense of confronting a photograph of young carefree men taken not long before they are all killed in World War I That mans not more alive whom you confront And shake by the hand see hale hear speak loud Than any of these six celluloid smiles are Nor prehistoric or fabulous beast more dead No thought so vivid as their smoking blood To regard this photograph might well dement Such contradictory permanent horrors here Smile from the single exposure and shoulder out Ones own body from its instant and heat What the poem helps to underscore is not just the experience of the minds not being able to encompass something which it encounters56 but also the unnerving proximity of life and deathand thus the im portant connection she will develop between the exposure of our con cepts to the confrontation with skepticism and the physical exposure to vulnerability and mortality that we suffer because we like animals are embodied beings As Diamond puts it in a key moment in her essay unpacking her sense of Costellos startling assertion that I know what it is like to be a corpse The awareness we each have of being a living body being alive to the world carries with it exposure to the bodily sense of vulnerability to death sheer animal vulnerability the vulnerability we share with them This vulnerability is capable of panicking us To be able to ac knowledge it at all let alone as shared is wounding but acknowledg ing it as shared with other animals in the presence of what we do to them is capable not only of panicking one but also of isolating one as Elizabeth Costello is isolated Is there any difficulty in seeing why we should not prefer to return to moral debate in which the livingness and death of animals enter as facts that we treat as relevant in this or that way not as presences that may unseat our reason 74 But there is yet a third type of exposure or finitude that is cru cial here as well as practiced readers of Heidegger or for that matter of Cavell or Derrida will already have guessed our exposurein a radical sense our subjectionto language and writing in ways that bear directly on what it means to do philosophy what philosophy can do in the face of these existential and ethical challenges One further conse quence of everything we have been saying thus far is that the relation ship between philosophical thinking concepts and philosophy as a writing practice now takes on unprecedented importance which is why Heidegger and Derrida and Cavell write the way they dowhich is to say unphilosophically even literarily Against the backdrop of what is often referred to as the linguistic turn in twentiethcentury philosophy we find a direct line of connection between the problem of philosophical skepticism and the work of Wittgenstein on language that will prove so important to Diamond and in a different way to Cavell But it is also on this point as I will try to bring out later that crucial differences emerge between this sort of work emerging as it does out of an especially adventurous wing of the analytical tradition and the work of Derrida who construes the consequences of the rela tion between philosophy and language of our finitude in relation to both in ways that bear directly on how we may and may not think of our relations to ourselves and to nonhuman animals Diamonds earlier work is worth revisiting here in some detail As she insists in an essay from 2001 called Injustice and Animals our grammatical redescription of a philosophical problem is crucial and in some sense determinative of our ability to do justice to the ethical challenges it entails57 For Diamond the fundamental ques tion of justice issues from an essentially different conceptual realm from the question of rights As she argues elaborating on some ideas of Simone Weil when genuine issues of justice and injustice are framed in terms of rights they are thereby distorted and trivial ized because the language of rights still bears the imprint of the con text in which it was shaped Roman law and its codification of property rightsnot least of course property rights over slaves 120 But the question of justice cannot be reduced to the question of the fairness or unfairness of a share The attempt to give voice to real injustice in the language of rights Diamond argues falters because of the underlying tie between rights and a system of entitlement that is con cerned not with evil done to a person but with how much he or she flesh and finitude gets compared to other participants in the system 121 In rights dis course she argues the character of our conflicts is made obscure by what Wittgenstein would call a poor grammatical description of the problem of justice 124 Instead what generates our moral response to animals and their treatment is our sense of the mortality and vulnerability that we share with them of which the brute subjection of the bodyin the treatment of animals as mere research tools say or in the torture of political pris oners in waris perhaps the most poignant testament For Diamond the horror at the conceptualizing of animals as putting nothing in the way of their use as mere stuff depends on a comparable horror at human relentlessness and pitilessness in the exercise of power toward other humans 136 What the rights tradition misses in her view is that the capacity to respond to injustice as injustice depends not on working out from a safe ontological distance as it were who should have a fair share of this or that abstract good but on a recognition of our own vulnerabilitya recognition not demanded and in some sense actively avoided by rightsoriented thinking 121 We can get a sense of the implications of this view for the grain of Diamonds thinking by following her discussion of a highly publicized case several years ago In a videotape smuggled out of the University of Pennsylvanias Head Injury Laboratory researchers and lab workers were shown making fun of a baboon who had been subjected to mas sive head injury in their experiments and was now serving as a mere prop for their jokes as one of the lab workers posed with one animal who had large cranial sutures and the rest of the staffincluding the director of the lablaughed at the animal and made fun of his punk look 148n41 Viewers almost without exception find this tape shock ing and deeply disturbingbut not Diamond argues in a way ac countable or defensible by either side of the animal rights debate For Diamond the nub of the issue here is that the animals body which is all it has as a poor mans body may be all he has is turned into the mere butt of your jokes the animal lacks the power to get away or to resist and what is morally repugnant is to make this disempower ment this absolute subjection the occasion for jokes But the moral repugnance of such a thing is not easily accounted for by the rights framework fixated as it is on the dependence of rights on interests good of the animal Not being a butt of humor is not taken to be part of its good Diamond writes It may seem to a defender of animal rights that although we should not ridicule animals it will be hard to make out that we owe it to the animals not to ridicule them In the background here is the idea that we cannot owe it to animals    unless they would suffer from such treatment and the idea would be that an animal cannot suffer from being ridiculed if it is not even aware that it is being ridiculed 13738 What such an insight points toward is that there is something wrong with the contrast taken to be exhaustive between demand ing ones rights and begging for kindnessbegging for what is merely kindness The idea that those are the only possibilities is    one of the main props of the idea that doing injustice is failing to respect rights 129 Contemporary moral theory thus pushes apart justice on the one hand and compassion love pity tenderness on the other 131 but Diamonds understanding of the question has at its center the idea that a kind of loving attention to another being a possible victim of injustice is essential to any understanding of the evil of injustice 13132 In this light one might well agree with Weils suggestion as Diamond does that in fact rights can work for justice or for in justice and as such the concept of rights possesses a kind of moral noncommitment to the good 128 In an important sense in other words rights are beside the point of justice per se and the language of rights is one might say meant to be useful in contexts in which we cannot count on the kind of understanding of evil that depends on lov ing attention to the victim 139 There are in other words two different and in fact incommen surable kinds of value here 121a point missed by both sides of what Diamond calls that great arena of dissociated thought contemporary debate about animals rights58 The problem with both sides of the debaterepresented by say Peter Singer on one side and on the other the philosopher Michael Leahy and his avatar Thomas OHearne in The Lives of Animalsis that they are locked into a model of justice in which a being does or does not have rights on the basis of its possession or lack of morally significant characteristics that can be empirically derived Both sides argue that what is involved in moral thought is flesh and finitude knowledge of empirical similarities and differences and the test ing and application of general principles of evaluation59 And so as Diamond puts it in The Difficulty of Reality the opposite sides in the debate may have more in common than they realize In the voices we hear in the debate about animal rights those of people like Singer on the one hand and those of Leahy and the fictional OHearne on the other there is shared a desire for a because because animals are this kind of being or because they are that kind of being thusandsuch is their standing for our moral thought 71 But what Diamond hears in both sets of voices is an evasion of our exposure to an arena of moral complexity in which to quote Cavell the other can present me with no mark or feature on the basis of which I can settle my attitude 71 Part of the reason for that of course is that such attitudes are far from the thin ifPthenQ abstractions that a certain kind of phi losophy takes them to be They are thick with psychological vexation and rife with contradictory impulses and attachments So Diamond is concerned to show not just that such a picture of ethics confuses the question of justice with the mediocre level of mere rights but also that it bears no resemblance to what she suggests is our moral life60 For her proponents of animal rights in the analytical tradition are wrong when they insist that the distinction between human and animal is not ethically fundamental At the same time however those who oppose animal rights within that same analytical tradition are wrong about how the difference between humans and animals is relevant The no tion human being is of the greatest significance in moral thought she argues but not because it is a biological notion 264 Rather the concept of human being is a main source of that moral sensibility which we may then be able to extend to nonhuman animals We can come to think of killing an animal as in some circumstances at least similar to homicide she continues but the significance of doing so depends on our already having an idea of what it is to kill a man and for us as opposed to abstract Moral Agents the idea of what it is to kill a man does depend on the sense of human life as special as something set apart from what else happens on the planet61 For Diamond then it is crucial to take account of what human beings have made of the difference between human beings and ani mals62 As she puts it elsewhere If we appeal to people to prevent suffering and we in our appeal try to obliterate the distinction between human beings and animals and just get people to speak or think of different species of animals there is no footing left from which to tell us what we ought to do    The moral expectations of other human beings demand something of me as other than an animal and we do something like imaginatively read into animals something like such expectations when we think of vege tarianism as enabling us to meet a cows eyes There is nothing wrong with that there is something wrong with trying to keep that response and destroy its foundation63 So for Diamond it is not by denying the special status of human being but by intensifying it that we can come to think of nonhuman animals not as bearers of interests or as rights holders but rather as something much more compelling fellow creatures That phrase does not mean biologically an animal something with biological life but rather refers to our response to animals as our fellows in mortality in life on this earth64 Hence the difference between human and nonhuman animals may indeed start out as a biological difference but it becomes some thing for human thought through being taken up and made something ofby generations of human beings in their practices their art their literature their religion65 practices that enable us to imaginatively read into animals expectations that originate in the human the other than an animal Given her critique of the rights framework and her emphasis on compassion not standing as fundamental to justice it may come as a surprise that Diamond finds in the contemporary animal rights move ment a commitment to justice not available in the concept of mere animal welfare The welfarist view she writes is essentially that we should ease the burdens we impose on animals without getting off their backs without ceasing to impose burdens on them burdens that we impose because we can because they are in general helpless to resist us But the force of the animal rights movement comes from the sense of the profound injustice of thisa sense however that its dominant language of rights is not equipped to articulate But if we reject the opposition all too dominant in contemporary moral the ory of justice and compassion rights and pity what is revealed is a kind of pitilessness at the heart of welfarism a willingness to go ahead flesh and finitude with what we do to the vulnerable a willingness to go on subject ing them to our power because we can that is different not in struc ture but only in degree from what goes on in the animal research labs Willingness is indeed too weak a word she writes we will not give up a form of life resting on the oppression of others and the will to continue exercising power in such ways    is inseparable from the compassion we express in welfarismone that has nothing to do with the grounds of justice in embodiment vulnerability and finitude as Diamond conceives it66 Double Finitude or Taking Bioethics off Autopilot The originality and subtlety of Diamonds position lie in no small part then in her separation of the question of justice from the discourse of rightsand beyond that in her insistence that vulnerability and com passion are very much to the point of justice and in a profound sense lie at its very heart Diamonds nuanced thinking of these questions helps us to bring out more precisely the oddly disjunctive and muddled character of Nussbaums work that is created by how her chosen philo sophical approach forecloses and frustrates her altogether admirable attempt to move beyond the reduction of the problem of justice for nonhuman animals to interests that we find in utilitarianism and replace it with a broader view of capabilities and flourishing that takes an interest not just in pleasure and pain but in complex forms of life and functioning67 Both agree as Nussbaum puts it that the best reason to be against slavery torture and lifelong subordination is a reason of justice not an empirical calculation of total or average well being 343 Similarly Nussbaum like Diamond insists that the power of sympathetic imagining of the lives of nonhuman animals of the sort made available by literature but not only there is important and relevant to questions of moral judgment As she puts it imagining the lives of animals makes them real to us in a primary way as potential subjects of justice 355 It is entirely symptomatic in this regard how ever that while the force of literature for Diamond is its difference from philosophy its ability to confront propositional analytic thought with its own limitations even unnervingly so as in Hughess Six Young Men for Nussbaum literature serves as a kind of kinder gentler sup plement to analytic philosophys project of sentimental education stirring in us identifications empathetic responses and projections that may then be readily formalized in analytical propositions 411 As Harpham succinctly puts it In Nussbaum the specificity of litera ture as a discourse an object of professional study is almost altogether erased and replaced by a conception that treats it bluntly as moral phi losophy The aesthetic is made to serve the aims of culture and moral ity in a dedifferentiated unity rarely seen in the modern world And philosophical reading is thus calculated to extract maxims that could guide contemporary policy makers economists or jurists68 Similarly the change in philosophical approach that would seem to be required by Nussbaums attempt to honor the importance of sym pathetic imagining in questions of justicethe very impulses that drive her away from the thin accounts of utilitarianism and contrac tarianismis immediately foreclosed by her insistence that justice is the sphere of basic entitlements and that what is lacking in the con tract theory of a Rawls is the sense of the animal itself as an agent    a creature to whom something is due69 As Diamonds work suggests however such a philosophical approach only reinstates the reduction of questions of justice to questions of entitlement that the capabilities approach was meant to resist in the first place thus pushing apart the questions of justice and compassion in precisely the way that Nussbaum had resisted in both utilitarian and contractarian approachesa sepa ration made all the more acute by Nussbaums characteristically fuzzy insistence that on the one hand compassion overlaps with the sense of justice and a full allegiance to justice requires compassion for beings who suffer wrongfully but on the other compassion itself is too in determinate to capture our sense of what is wrong with the treatment of animals 337a wrong that must presumably be directed at their entitlements as rightsholding agents As Diamond would be the first to point out however what is indeterminate is not our compassion for the suffering of nonhuman animals but the idea that rights and en titlement bear anything other than a completely contingent relation ship derived from the historically and ideologically specific character of our juridical and political institutions and the picture of the subject of rights that they provide to the question of justice for nonhuman animals Or to put it slightly otherwise the idea that animals deserve flesh and finitude justice because they are moral agents and not just moral patients while perhaps problematic in its own right70 undercuts Nussbaums earlier assertion that the key link between humans and nonhuman animals as subjects of justice is not their agency but exactly the opposite their shared finitude as embodied vulnerable beings I would like to turn now to Jacques Derridas later work to pro vide an example of how the admirable impulses behind Nussbaums attempt to think the questions of justice and moral standing for non humans might motivate a very different view of what philosophy is eventuating in theoretical and methodological commitments that avoid not just the sort of problems we have just been discussing in Nussbaum but also limitations in Diamonds remarkable set of essays on these questions At first glance Derridas work seems quite consonant with Diamonds beginning with three main features First Derrida empha sizes like Diamond and like Nussbaum that the fundamental ethical bond we have with nonhuman animals resides in our shared finitude our vulnerability and mortality as fellow creatures a phrase he too invokes at key moments in his argument Second Derrida shares with Diamond against Nussbaum a certain understanding of what ethics is not propositionally deriving a set of rules for conduct that apply generically in all cases but confronting our exposure to a permanent condition in which to use Cavells phrase there is no way to settle our attitude Third Derrida also insists that crucial to both of these is to show as Diamond puts it in an earlier essay how philosophi cal misconceptions about language are connected with blindness to what our conceptual life is like71a blindness that is everywhere on display as I have been suggesting in Nussbaums attempt to think the animal question It is here I think that Diamonds approach as illuminating and searching as it is runs aground She is certainly right to suggest that our ability to think questions of bioethics depends fundamentally on the understandingindeed the theoryof language that we bring to it But what we find in her work I believe is an understanding of how language operates in a philosophical contextan understanding di rectly linked to her notion of human beingthat undermines her at tempt to open the question of justice beyond the human sphere alone I choose to focus on Derrida in this connection not just because of his wellknown theory of language as écriture dissemination trace and so on but also because we find in his recent work a gathering of terms around questions of justice and the living that is strikingly simi lar to what we have seen in Diamond It will come as a surprise to any reader I think that in his recent work on ethics and the question of nonhuman others Derrida returns to what serves in Singers work as the benchmark for the ethical consideration of animals namely the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Benthams contention that the relevant question here is not can they talk or can they reason but can they suffer For Derrida putting the question in this way changes everything because from Aristotle to Descartes from Descartes especially to Heidegger Levinas and Lacan posing the question of the animal in terms of either the capacity for thought or language de termines so many others concerning power or capability pouvoirs and attributes avoirs being able having the power to give to die to bury ones dead to dress to work to invent a technique72 What makes Benthams reframing of the problem so powerful is that now the ques tion is disturbed by a certain passivity It bears witness manifesting already as question the response that testifies to sufferance a pas sion a notbeingable What of the vulnerability felt on the basis of this inability he continues what is this nonpower at the heart of power    What right should be accorded it To what extent does it concern us It concerns us directly in fact for mortality resides there as the most radical means of thinking the finitude that we share with animals the mortality that belongs to the very finitude of life to the experience of compassion73 In Derrida as in Diamond the vulnerability and ultimately mor tality that we share with nonhuman animals and the compassion that they elicitwhat Diamond characterizes as the capacity to be harmed but also to be brought up short of inflicting harm on another by rec ognition of that capacity74lie at the core of the question of ethics not just mere kindness but justice For Derrida too what is still presented in such a problematic way as animal rights has a force quite indepen dent of the philosophical framework that usually accompanies it a force that involves a new experience of this compassion one that has opened anew the immense question of pathos of suffering pity and compassion and the place that has to be accorded to the interpretation flesh and finitude of this compassion to the sharing of this suffering among the living to the law ethics and politics that must be brought to bear upon this experience of compassion For Derrida then the point of the animal rights movement however flawed its articulation is to awaken us to our responsibilities and our obligations with respect to the living in general and precisely to this fundamental compassion that were we to take it seriously would have to change even the very basis    of the philosophical problematic of the animal75 For Derrida too the force of the animal rights movement out strips its own ability to articulate the questions it addresses questions that require an alternative conception of ethics to the rights tradition of analytical philosophy as it manifests itself in Singer and others For Singer as we have seen ethics means the application of what Derrida will elsewhere characterize as a calculable processin this case quite literallyof the utilitarian calculus that would tally up the interests of the particular beings in question in a given situation regardless of their species and would determine what counts as a just act by calculating which action maximizes the greatest good for the greatest number76 In doing so however Singer would reduce ethics to the very antithesis of ethics in Derridas sense because it would overleap what Derrida calls the ordeal of the undecidable which must be gone through by any decision worthy of the name A decision that didnt go through the ordeal of the undecidable would not be a free decision it would only be the programmable application or unfolding of a calculable process It might be legal it would not be just    And once the ordeal of the undecidable is past if that is possi ble the decision has again followed a rule or given itself a rule invented it or reinvented reaffirmed it it is no longer presently just fully just77 Ordeal is indeed the word we want here which is one reason Diamond rivets our attention more than once on Elizabeth Costellos rawness of nerves her sufferance of a responsibility that is both undeniable and unappeasable But what the rights view of ethics gives us insteadin either the Singer or Nussbaum versionis a deflection of this fully ethical ordeal one in which as Diamond puts it We would be given the presence or absence of moral community or thusandsuch degree or kind of moral community with animals78 Aside from thus being the antithesis of the ethical in Derridas sense such a calculation in its derivation of the shared interests of human and nonhuman animals would confuse what Diamond calls biological concepts with the con cepts proper to ethical thought This is what Derrida has in mind and more as we are about to see in his criticism of a biological continuism whose sinister connotations we are well aware of one that ignores the abyssal rupture between human and nonhuman forms of life but also within and between different forms of nonhuman animal life79 I have thus never believed he writes in some homogeneous continuity be tween what calls itself man and what he calls the animal80 At this juncture howeverand it is marked quite precisely by Derridas emphasis on what calls itself man and what he calls the animalsome fundamental differences between Derrida and Diamond begin to come into view not least in the articulation of this peculiar thing called the human We can get a sense of this differ ence by returning to the crucial role that vulnerability passivity and ultimately mortality play here for both Diamond and Derrida Let us recall Diamonds contention that we can come to think of killing an animal as in some circumstances at least similar to homicide but the significance of doing so depends on our already having an idea of what it is to kill a man81 Such an idea depends however on a relation to our own mortality that is rejected in Derridas work for Derrida con tra Diamond we never have an idea of what death is for usindeed death is precisely that which can never be for usand if we did then the ethical relation to the other would be immediately foreclosed This is clearest perhaps in Derridas reading of Heidegger and his concept of beingtowarddeath a concept that appearsbut only appearsto do justice to the passivity and finitude in which the ethical resides As Richard Beardsworth characterizes it for Derrida Heidegger appropriates the limit of death rather than returning it to the other of time The existential of beingtowardsdeath is consequently a being able pouvoiretre not the impossibility of all power whose passivity and vulnerability tie the self to the other in an ethical relation For Derrida on the other hand the impossibility of death for the ego confirms that the experience of finitude is one of radical passivity That the I cannot experience its own death means firstly that death is an immanence without horizon and secondly that time is that which exceeds my death that time is the flesh and finitude generation which precedes and follows me    Death is not a limit or horizon which recognized allows the ego to assume the there as in Heideggers beingtowarddeath it is something that never arrives in the egos time a notyet which confirms the priority of time over the ego marking accordingly the precedence of the other over the ego82 For Derrida then no relation to death can appear as such and if there is no as to death then the relation to death is always mediated through an other The as of death always appears through an others death for another 118 Beardsworth quotes Derrida The death of the other thus becomes    first always first Hence Beardsworth ar gues The recognition of the limit of death is always through another and is therefore at the same time the recognition of the other 118 And since the same is true of the other in relation to its own death what this means is that death impossibilizes existence and does so both for me and for the othersince death is no more for the other than it is for me 132 But it is paradoxically in just this impossibility that the possibility of justice resides the permanent call of the other in the face of which the subject always arrives too late Or to put this in somewhat different terms when Diamond affirms Costellos asser tion that I know what it is like to be a corpse Derridas response would be No you dont Only the other does and for that you are held hostage to use Levinass term in unappeasable ethical debt to the otherhence the otherwise odd idea of the gift of death to borrow from Derridas book by the same title To put it another way there is the suggestion in Diamond I think that imaginative and literary projection can somehow achieve in this instance what propositional syllogistic philosophy cannot achieve the nonconceptual nonlogical force of I know what its like to be a corpse but Derrida would see this too as a deflection of exposure exposure not just to mortal ity but also to a certain estranging operation of language to a second kind of finitude whose implications are enormous a point Ill return to in just a moment Such is the full resonance I think of Derridas recent contention with regard to Bentham that the word can pouvoir changes sense and sign here once one asks can they suffer The word wavers henceforth As soon as such a question is posed what counts is not only the idea of a transitivity or activity being able to speak to reason and so on the important thing is rather what impels it towards selfcontradiction something we will later relate back to autobiography83 What Derrida has in mind by the auto of autobiography is exemplified in Diamonds picture of the human in relation to ethics a picture in which as in Heidegger vulnerability passivity and finitude are recuperated as a beingable and a transitivity thus ontologizing and hypostatizing the split be tween the human and the otherall its othersacross which the human then reaches in an act of benevolence toward an other we imag ine is enough like us to warrant ethical treatment This only reinforces our suspicion that this human being is an essentially homogeneous and undifferentiated creature that is capable of a more or less transparent relationship to its own nature a relationship that it then expresses in and through language and may then extend benevolentlyor notto the nonhuman other This seems clear enough for example in Diamonds conten tion that the basis for justice lies in the human beings unreasoned expectation of good one that can if we are willing to attend to it stop us from inflicting harm not that it generally or even frequently happens she admits that people are thus inhibited84 We should recall here too her contention that the moral expectations of other human beings demand something of me as other than an animal and we do something like imaginatively read into animals something like such expectations when we think of vegetarianism as enabling us to meet a cows eyes85 In both these examples what the language of un reasoned good moral expectations and imaginatively read into unsuccessfully attempts to paper over is just how undifferentiated in relation to itself the human is in this account and how hypostatized its relations to the nonhuman other have become And matters are not helped any by her contention that our hearing the moral appeal of an animal is our hearing it speakas it werethe language of our fellow human beings86 There are two distinct issues here that we need to treat in turn The first of course is who exactly these fellow human beings are particularly if we have ruled out recourse to a biological concept as Diamond insists we should The secondand I will return to this in a momentis that even if we know who those fellows are what does it mean to say that there is a language proper to them and that the flesh and finitude animal must speak it if it is to be heard morally As for the first issue perhaps the most succinct way to make my point is simply to note the question of ethnocentrism that it begs a problem made all the more acute by Diamonds rejection of reference to biological or scientific co ordinates which might be viewed as independent of cultural determi nations For example she writes in Experimenting on Animals that if we want to know whether it is a good thing to treat dogs differently from other animals or cows differently from other animals it is absurd to think these are questions you should try to answer in some sort of totally general terms quite independently of seeing what particular human sense people have actually made out of the differ ences or similarities you are concerned with And this is not predict able If the Nuer for example had not actually made something hu manly remarkable out of giving cows a treatment quite different from that accorded other animals one could not know that singling cows out for special treatment could come to that    The modes of life and thought of our ancestors including their moral thinking have made the differences and similarities which are now available for us to use in our thinking and our emotions and decisions 351 Diamond may be right of course that we are never confronted with the existence of beings with discoverable empirical similarities and differences toward which we must act with the aid of general principles in such and such a way 351 But the problem is that there is nothing in Diamonds position to prevent us from carrying out ex actly the same sort of thought experiment here that we saw Cavalieri carry out earlier with Nozicks relational view of ethics To wit If the Germans for example had not actually made something humanly re markable out of giving Aryans a treatment quite different and so on Rather the only thing that does stop us is the extraordinarily hedged and finally empty contention that we may readily distinguish between attitudes toward racial difference species difference sexual difference and so on that are humanly valuable and those that arent 351 Of course one communitys humanly valuable is anothers humanly deplorable which is exactly the question with which the whole dis cussion began We seem then to be faced with a double bind How can we agree with Diamonds rejection of basing ethical questions on empirical data and biological concepts and at the same time distance her view from the pernicious ethnocentrism harbored by a relational or completely culturally referenced view of ethics Derrida captures the problem when he asks the same question about historicism which is structured by precisely the same dilemma can one criticize it in the name of something other than truth and science the value of universality omni temporality the infinity of value etc and what happens to science when the metaphysical value of truth has been put into question    How are the effects of science and truth to be reinscribed87 The prob lem here in other words is that the ethnocentric we might have been forcibly opened to take account of what lies beyond its comfort zone by appeal to the universality and omnitemporality of truth and science that exceeds any ethnocentric determination which is essentially how the appeal to empirical interests functions in animal rights philosophy but that seems no longer possible in any straight forward sense even if as Derrida remarks in the same note the point of raising this difficulty is not in order to return naively to a relativist or sceptical empiricism At this juncture then we suspect that a different way of thinking these problems may be necessary a way suggested but only suggested I think by Diamonds remarkable essay The Difficulty of Reality In her earlier work as I have been arguing we find something like the problem we see in Richard Rortys concept of belief that there is nothing in the relation of the ethnos to itself what we have made of the humananimal difference that installs alterity not outside the self enclosed subject of the ethnos who may then benevolently recognize or notsuch difference from a safe and secure ontological distance as it were but rather at its very core as the truth of the subject itself88 In this light part of the strength and attraction of Diamonds The Difficulty of Reality is precisely its weakness Where the emphasis in earlier essays was on our ability Derridas pouvoirs to extend imagi natively an apparently secure sense of the human to animals hearing them speak our language seeing in them expectations of us as other than animal here when we try to put into words the experience of the difficulty of reality that we find bodied forth in Ted Hughess Six Young Men or Coetzees The Lives of Animals the words fail us the words dont do what we are trying to get them to do The words make flesh and finitude separate me from something I very much want to see But the fact that the words are apparently too weak to do what I am demanding from them does not mean that the experience here of powerlessness has been shown to involve a kind of grammatical error 8 The force of this turn in Diamonds thought and its consequences for ethics can be extended and elaborated by means of Derridas work which would help us to articulate more fully the implications of the fact that there are two kinds of finitude here two kinds of passivity and vulnerability The first type physical vulnerability embodiment and eventually mortality is paradoxically made unavailable inappropri able to us by the very thing that makes it availablenamely a second type of passivity or not being able which is the finitude we experi ence in our subjection to a radically ahuman technicity or mechanicity of language a technicity that has profound consequences of course for what we too hastily think of as our concepts which are therefore in an important sense not ours at all And here then we arrive at the third point of contactbut also finally of differencebetween Diamond and Derrida that I noted ear lier how philosophical misconceptions about language are connected with blindness to what our conceptual life is like to use Diamonds phrase Derridas point would be not only that we dont have a concept of the human but also that its a good thing too because it is only on the strength of that weakness that we are able to avoid both horns of the dilemma brought to light in Diamonds work on the one hand the constant threat of ethnocentrism that a certain understanding of Wittgenstein flirts with we do what we do because of what we have made of the difference between humans and animals which keeps us from lapsing into biological continuism and on the other hand the mining for ethical universals that for philosophers such as Singer Regan and Nussbaum would attempt to counter this very threat by un covering first principles of ethics via the antiethnocentric autonomy of reason Derrida I am suggesting makes available a third way whose response would be that yes it is true that what we think of as the prin ciples of personhood morality and so on are inseparable from who we are from our discourse as a mode of life to put it in Wittgensteins terms But at the same time we are not we we are not that auto of autobiography as in Derridas The Autobiographical Animal that humanism gives to itself Rather we are always radically other already in or ahuman in our very beingnot just in the evolutionary biological and zoological fact of our physical vulnerability and mortal ity our mammalian existence but also in our subjection to and consti tution in the materiality and technicity of a language that is always on the scene before we are as a precondition of our subjectivity And this means that what he calls man what we call we always covers over a more radical not being able that makes our very conceptual life possible Even more important perhapsat least for the topic at handis that this passivity and subjection are shared by humans and nonhumans the moment they begin to interact and communicate by means of any semiotic system As Derrida puts it in a wellknown passage from the interview Eating Well If one reinscribes language in a network of possibilities that do not merely encompass it but mark it irreducibly from the inside everything changes I am thinking in particular of the mark in general of the trace of iterability of différance These possibilities or necessities without which there would be no language are themselves not only human    And what I am proposing here should allow us to take into account sci entific knowledge about the complexity of animal languages genetic coding all forms of marking within which socalled human language as original as it might be does not allow us to cut once and for all where we would in general like to cut89 At this juncture we can feel the full force of the difference between Derridas posthumanist position and how Diamonds humanism for mulates the relation between language ethics and the humananimal divide In Injustice and Animals she suggests that applying the con cept of justice to nonhuman animals is a response to communicative pressure which she defines thus In our various activities including our attempts to think about our lives and to make sense of what we ex perience and what we do we can use words well or badly The ways of speaking we find in response to activities and experiences may accom modate a merely superficial kind of meaning it or we may be able to find words that more fully render experiences or activities words that can be meant more fully90 But I think it is clear by now that the flesh and finitude distinction between superficially meaning it and really meaning it is bound to fare no better than Lacans distinction between really pre tending and just pretending to pretend that I discussed in the previous chapter In both cases what is at stake is the recovery and maintenance of the humanist subject as auto as a free consciousness present to the totality of the operation and of absolutely meaningful speech vouloirdire master of itself the teleological jurisdiction of an entire field whose organizing center remains intentionan intention that ex presses itself in the difference between pretending and pretending to pretend meaning something superficially and really meaning it91 It is over and against this recovery of humanism by what one might think of as the analyticwithapologies tradition that Derrida counterpoises what he characterizes as the corrupting and contami nating work of iterability the trace and so on92 As we saw in the opening chapter iterability does not signify simply    repeatability of the same but rather alterability of this same idealized in the singu larity of the event    It entails the necessity of thinking at once both the rule and the event concept and singularity as such it marks the essential and ideal limit of all pure idealization but not as the concept of nonideality as idealitys pure other 119 Like the undecidability that it generates iterability remains heterogeneous to rather than op posed to the order of the ideal the calculable and the pure Hence the form of ethical responsibility it entails is of another order altogether tending to each specific concatenation and iteration of rule and event to this particular undecidable 116 that is always a determinate oscil lation between possibilities one that takes place in strictly defined situations for example discursivesyntactical or rhetoricalbut also political ethical etc And as Derrida emphasizes such instances are pragmatically determined 148 Equally important for Derridaand this is crucial to situating the question of the animal in the broader context of posthumanism that we have been developingis that this second form of finitude this second kind of not being able renders uncertain and unstable unsettled in Cavells termsthe relationship of the human to itself because it renders unstable not just the boundary between human and animal but also between the organic and the mechanical or techno logical And here perhaps more clearly than anywhere else we can locate the most radical sense of Derridas posthumanism which finds the generative force of the nonliving at the origins of any living being human or animal who communicates and this in the broadest sense with another For these reasonsbecause of the estrangement of the the human from the auto that we give to ourselvesthe rela tion between the human and nonhuman animals is constantly opened anew and as it were permanently It is a wound if you will that can never be healed and is only further excavated and deepened by the very iterative technologies thinking writing speech that we use to try and suture it As Derrida summarizes it in a recent interview Beginning with Of Grammatology the elaboration of a new concept of the trace had to be extended to the entire field of the living or rather to the lifedeath relation beyond the anthropological limits of spoken language    At the time I stressed that the concepts of writing trace gramma or grapheme exceeded the opposition humannonhuman All the deconstructive gestures I have attempted to perform on philo sophical texts    consist in questioning the selfinterested misrecogni tion of what is called the Animal in general and the way in which these interpret the border between Man and Animal93 I stress this intercalation of the boundary between the biological organic and the mechanicaltechnical in relation to the infra and transhuman in no small part because Diamond herself is extremely interested in itmost conspicuously of course in her reading of the exposure of the photograph in Ted Hughess Six Young Men a technological archival artifact that confronts us with a shuddering awareness of death and life together94 Here however Diamond and Derrida pull us in different and perhaps even opposite directions for Diamond then glosses that exposure in terms of Costellos contention that I know what it is like to be a corpsea contention whose signifi cance she unpacks along the following lines in the final paragraph of her essay as a kind of rejoinder to pragmatism A language a form of thought cannot we may be told get things right or wrong fit or fail to fit reality it can only be more or less useful What I want to end with is not exactly a response to that it is to note how much that coming apart of thought and reality belongs to flesh and blood 12 Derridas point however is that this coming apart is not just of flesh and blood flesh and finitude constituted by a technicity with which it is prosthetically entwined a diacritical semiotic machine of language in the broadest sense that exceeds any and all presence including our own95 That it is in the broadest sense can be brought out by looking briefly at Derridas own confrontation with an exposure of the sort Diamond is interested in in this case an exposure of a piece of filma confrontation that will have considerable resonance for my discussion of the relationship between technology ethics and archive in the final chapter In a set of conversations with Bernard Stiegler published in English as Echographies of Television Derrida is concerned to differ with Roland Barthess suggestion in Camera Lucida that the photo is liter ally an emanation of the referent From a real body which was there proceed radiations that come to touch me I who am here    A kind of umbilical cord ties the body of the photographic thing to my gaze96 Instead Derrida insists that the modern possibility of the photograph joins in a single system death and the referent97 What he means by this rather enigmatic formulation is that a kind of spectrality inheres in the technology of the image because of its fundamental iterability Because we know that once it has been taken captured this image will be reproducible in our absence because we know this already we are already haunted by this future which brings our death Our dis appearance is already here    And this is what makes our experience so strange We are spectralized by the shot captured or possessed by spectrality in advance What has dare I say constantly haunted me in this logic of the spec ter is that it regularly exceeds all the oppositions between visible and invisible sensible and insensible A specter is both visible and invisible both phenomenal and nonphenomenal a trace that marks the present with its absence in advance 117 Derrida then tells a story that is haunting in its own right about his participation in Ken McMullens film Ghostdance where he impro vised a scene with the French actress Pascale Ogier in which he asks her And what about you do you believe in ghosts and she replies Yes now I do yes But imagine the experience I had Derrida says when two or three years later after Pascale Ogier had died I watched the film again in the United States at the request of students who wanted to discuss it with me Suddenly I saw Pascals face which I knew was a dead womans face come onto the screen She answered my questions Do you believe in ghosts Practically looking me in the eye she said to me again on the big screen Yes now I do yes Which now    I had the unnerving sense of the return of her specter the specter of her specter coming back to say to meto me here now Now    now    now that is to say in this dark room on another continent in another world here now yes believe me I believe in ghosts But at the same time I know that the first time Pascale said this already when she repeated this in my office already this spectrality was at work It was already there she was already saying this and she knew just as we know that even if she hadnt died in the interval one day it would be a dead woman who said I am dead or I am dead I know what Im talking about from where I am and Im watching you and this gaze remained dissymmetrical exchanged beyond all possible exchange    the other gaze met in an infinite night 120 So here is Elizabeth Costello again in a different light What I know is what a corpse cannot know that it is extinct that it knows nothing and will never know anything anymore For an instant before my whole structure of knowledge collapses in panic I am alive inside that contra diction dead and alive at the same time98 And here is Hughes again by the light of day that is also if we believe Derrida the light of night That mans not more alive whom you confront And shake by the hand see hale hear speak loud Than any of these six celluloid smiles are Nor prehistoric or fabulous beast more dead No thought so vivid as their smoking blood To regard this photograph might well dement Such contradictory permanent horrors here Smile from the single exposure and shoulder out Ones own body from its instant and heat In the end howeverand this is the final difference I want to mark between the CavellDiamond line and DerridaDerrida derives from this dementing force which bleeds together organism and machine living and dead prehistoric beast and ones own human instant and heat a kind of law or general economy the fundaments of which reach all the way back to his earliest work As he puts it in Echographies of Television and this descends directly from my earlier discussion of the flesh and finitude other this relationship constitutes an inheritance a genealogy of the law99 before the specter of the dead we are before the law with out any possible symmetry without reciprocity 120 The wholly otherand the dead person is the wholly otherwatches me concerns me and concerns or watches me while addressing to me without however answering me a prayer or an injunction an infinite demand which becomes the law for me it concerns me it regards me it addresses itself only to me at the same time that it exceeds me infi nitely and universally without my being able to exchange a glance with him or with her 12021 This is most obvious perhaps in the bestknown example of the spectral phenomenon that Derrida discussesShakespeares Hamlet where the relationship between inheritance law responsibility and spectrality is particularly even Oedipally pronounced But it would also seem to be the case with Hughess six young men in the photograph to whom we as the living feel a strange kind of responsibility and debt that is unsettling because unanswerable a point powerfully put in motion early in Diamonds essay In Derridas words the other comes before me 122 But we know from Derridas vantage that this responsibility cannot be metit is an infinite demandbecause of the law of iter ability itself He writes If the law of iterability    exceeds the inten tional structure that it renders possible and whose teleoarchaeology it limits if it is the law not merely of intentionality nor for that mat ter merely of the language or the writing of man then the question of the specificity of intentionality in this field without limits remains open100 In the face of the pragmatic and determinate forms of treat ment visited by humans upon nonhuman others in the face of the in justices noted by all the thinkers I have been discussing the question is how can I intend otherwise in actions that even if groundless and without purity or ideality of origin in a speaking or thinking subject nonetheless find their mark we might say in material effects on other living beings The issue here in other words is that if we do take seriously the pragmatic specificity of the relationship of iterability and intention then the first thing we are bound to notice is this human and at least some nonhuman animals may be in a phenomenological or ontologi cal sense more or less equally subjected to the exteriority and mate riality of the trace in a way that only the living can be that is what it means to be mortal to be fellow creatures to be subjected But what is not at all shared equally even if this is the case is the material disposition of that fact in practices and institutions whose effects bear very differently on human and nonhuman animalseffects Derrida himself is of course well aware of101 To put it another way humans and animals may share a fundamental nonpower at the heart of power may share a vulnerability and passivity without limit as fellow living beings but what they do not share equally is the power to ma terialize their misrecognition of their situation and to reproduce that materialization in institutions of exploitation and oppression whose effects are far from symmetrical in species terms From this vantage the issue is not only what should we dothe question of justice that Derrida would have us confront anew in each iteration without re course to calculation and ethical formulaebut also what will we do in the face of such challenges As David Wood puts it in his searching discussion of Derridas interview Eating Well there is a place for argument proof and dem onstration in philosophy but what this critical function opens onto are more or less motivated possibilities of responseand with regard to deconstruction specifically the ability to respond to what has not been adequately schematized formulated etc102 In Woods view those pos sibilities are evacuatedeviscerated we might sayby Derrida in two ways in Eating Well where he explicitly rejects vegetarianism as a more ethically responsible answer to the question How should one eat First Derrida frames the question in such a way as to incorpo rate and interiorize the actual eating of animals inside the symbolic eating of anything by anyone 30 so that the specific practice of eating animals becomes simply one more version of the larger symbolic struc ture by which Man in the Western philosophical tradition secures its transcendence through mastery of nature repression of the body everything that Derrida associates with the term carnophallogocen trism 30 In so doing Derrida evacuates the differencethe material alteritybetween different sacrificial structures and practices And the flesh and finitude result of this assimilation as Wood puts it is to the extent that in this culture sacrifice in the broad symbolic sense seems unavoidable there would seem to be little motivation for practical transformations of our engagement in sacrificial behavior 31 Second what he calls Derridas ambivalence toward vegetarian ism seems to be consonant with deconstructions idea of ethics as a practice of eternal vigilance one that cannot become some sort of alternative ethical seal of approval for vegetarianism or anything else But the problem here is that the avoidance of that widening path of resistance to violence that is vegetarianism could end up preserving against the temptations of progressive practical engagementthe kind of good conscience that too closely resembles a beautiful soul 32 In other words the eternal vigilance of deconstructive ethics which depends on always attending without the aid of predetermined judg ments and formulae to the specific iteration of event and rule here threatens to flipflop into the opposite of vigilance one whose good conscience resides in the security of its knowledge that there is no such thing as a good conscience To put it slightly otherwise Wood would force on Derrida the same distinction drawn earlier by Diamond Is Derrida merely an ani mal welfarist In the end do we find in Derridas work on ethics and the animal a reproductionto quote Diamond once againof a kind of pitilessness at the heart of welfarism a willingness to go ahead with what we do to the vulnerable a willingness to go on subjecting them to our power because we can because it suits us to do so a willingness that is inseparable from the compassion we express in welfarism103 What such a vantage point discloses is an essential tension in Derridas work on ethics between his insistence that we pay vigilant attention to the particular instance of decision of justice in all its thickness and heterogeneity without letting formulae and maxims do the work for us and a general law or economy of iterability that would render such decisions nonuniversalizable decisions whose foundations are local only while what is not local is the unavailability of such foundations from which to universalize This is not to say that Derridas position is without ethical force quite the contrary Regarding items six and seven in Contemporary Issues in Bioethics with which I began this chapter biomedical research and eugenics Derrida forcefully rivets our attentionas no one else in poststructuralist philosophy has doneon the infernal and mon strous conditions created for animals in product testing and factory farming by more and more audacious manipulations of the genome and other genetic forms of knowledge and the techniques of interven tion related to them that have reduced the animal to a mere vehicle for products and commodities104 Moreover as I noted in the opening pages he would call our attention to the process of codification in bioethics whereby the overdetermining material political and eco nomic relations between those in bioethics who formulate the rules and norms and those who legislate and enforce them are laid bare105 But Derridas position bears on the pragmatics of contemporary bioethics with which I began this chapter only at the extremes the pragmatic instance of judging particular cases on the one hand and the ordeal of the undecidable that attends such judgment and in principle makes universalization impossible while current bio ethics as a brand of policy studies and the edifice of law it takes for granted operate precisely in the middle zone abandoned by Derrida the maintenance or modification of generic universalizable norms in and through particular cases and the legal model of personhood with all its philosophical underpinnings that underwrites the process Derrida would have us pay attention to the specific instance of decision in a way foreclosed by the generality and logic of the law itself since the force of such specific instances for Derrida is in principle their ability to revolutionize or exceed the law itself their call for us to real ize that what is legal may not be just and vice versa Here one might readily think not just of issues regarding our treatment of animals such as xenotransplantation but also of issues such as assisted suicide the case of Terri Schiavo and the likeall of which would seem to depend on pragmatic particulars that obtain as it were beneath the level of the law and often create a jarring contradiction between what is legal and our sense of what is just At the other extreme Derridas general economy of iterability would prevent the generalization of such decisions taken in aggregate into a larger edifice or structurea new legal doctrine if you like and would highlight the differences and even the abyss between the intentionality that would attempt unilaterally to deploy such structures flesh and finitude and the material and archival force of such structures themselves What this means for bioethics in the pragmatic sense is that Derrida is of little use in enabling us to formulate new guidelines about particular surgical or experimental procedures that we could then generalize on behalf of more progressive policies But he is of immense use in forcing us to live with the fact that no matter how such policies are drawn the distinc tion between human and animal should be of no use in drawing them Animal Studies Disciplinarity and the PostHumanities What began in the early to mid1990s as a smattering of work in various fields on humananimal relations and their representation in various endeavorsliterary artistic scientifichas as we reach the end of the new millenniums first decade galvanized into a vibrant emergent field of interdisciplinary inquiry called animal studies or sometimes humananimal studies In what follows I want to sug gest that both rubrics are problematic in light of the broader context in which they must be confrontedthe context of posthumanism More specifically I hope to make it clear that the questions that oc cupy human animal studies can be addressed adequately only if we confront them on not just one level but two not just the level of con tent thematics and the object of knowledge the animal studied by animal studies but also the level of theoretical and methodological approach how animal studies studies the animal Just because we direct our attention to the study of nonhuman animals and even if we do so with the aim of exposing how they have been misunderstood and exploited that does not mean that we are not continuing to be humanistand therefore by definition anthropocentric Indeed one of the hallmarks of humanismand even more specifically that kind of humanism called liberalismis its penchant for that kind of plural ism in which the sphere of attention and consideration intellectual or ethical is broadened and extended to previously marginalized groups but without in the least destabilizing or throwing into radical question the schema of the human who undertakes such pluralization In that event pluralism becomes incorporation and the projects of humanism intellectually and liberalism politically are extended and indeed ex tended in a rather classic sort of way To put it this wayin terms of the ideological stakes of discipli narityis to signal that there are multiple contexts within which the animal studies question of animal studies disciplinarity and the humanities might be discussed had we world enough and timecontexts toward which I can only rapidly gesture here One of these would be the changing sta tus of the humanities themselvesa change sometimes described in the language of crisisin relation to what used to be called the public sphere and the more general questions of the humanities social cul tural and political role in a world that appears to need and value hu manistic knowledge less and less1 One might alsomoving outward to larger contextssituate this question in the context of the changing role and function of the university as an institution especially as that role has been reshaped by forces associated with the corporatization of social institutions generally2 And one might moreover explore both those issuesdisciplinary change and institutional changealong the lines cultivated by Alan Lius discussion of the humanities in terms of the broader context of knowledge work in The Laws of Cool 2004 Still farther afield one might ask after the role and status of animal stud ies in the context of growing attention to the biopolitical and to ques tions of biopower that derive at least from the work of the Frankfurt school and beyond that Marxs famous discussion of species being in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 wend their way through Michel Foucaults later work and receive contemporary attention from thinkers ranging from Giorgio Agamben and Roberto Esposito to Jacques Derrida and Judith Butler among others For surely the question of biopower radically changes our view of the animality of the human in ways marked for example by Agambens distinc tion between bios which marks the form or way of life proper to an individual or group and zoé which expresses the simple fact of liv ing common to all living beings3 For biopolitical theory the ani mality of the human becomes a central problemperhaps the central problemto be produced controlled or regulated for politics in its distinctly modern form Literary and Cultural Studies in the United States Historicism Theory and Disciplinarity I want to begin however with a more modest focus on the discipline in which I am housed literary and cultural studies where the relations animal studies between animal studies the humanities and its mission or missions and the problem of disciplinarity are being conjugated in an especially energetic and wideranging way In that context it is all the more im portant to note that the discipline itself has in recent years reached what feels to many like a crisis of coherence a disciplinary threshold of some sort4 The sharpest symptom perhaps is the schism that has been brewing for some time now to put it schematically between scholars committed primarily to matters of history and scholars com mitted primarily to matters of theory and in a different register the relation of form and meaning in the study of literature and culture And while historicism broadly speaking has no doubt ruled the day for some time now on the strength of the early momentum garnered by innovative works in New Historicism in fields such as early modern and romantic studies there are signs that this is changing in part be cause the dominant modes of historicism being practiced now seem to many a regression to the kind of old historicism that New Historicism itself sought to move beyond Critiques of the situation from across the intellectual and politi cal spectrum are not hard to find The romanticist Thomas Pfau for example is among the more strident critics though he might best be characterized as an intellectual historian Pfau observes that this more recent mode of historicism though it disavows the strong penchant for grand narrative    in favor of so many specialized microanalyses cannot achieve its recurrent quest for local transcendence to bor row Alan Lius famous formulation without underlying and largely unexamined ideological commitments of its ownan implicit frame work that Pfau pares down the following tacit assumptions 1 The Axiom of the Archive that specialized research understood at the recovery of previously overlooked materials and animal studies significance of contemporary critique arises from the primitive accu mulation of so many disaggregated voices and archival projects with the further assumption that critical knowledge will spontaneously arise from the openmarket interaction of presumptively equivalent indifferent perspectives 4 The Axiom of Retroactive Liberation or secularization that an in stitutional professional and transactional mode of critique will even tually liberate historical meanings from their alleged past entrapment in religious or ideological norms and values and in doing so will re store for us their temporarily missed yet always intended authentic secular core 5 The Axiom of Critique as a Guarantor of Historical Progress that the transactionalism of modern institutional knowledge effects a teleologi cal progression towards a hypostatized Liberal community envisioned as a wholly transparent inclusive tolerant and exhaustively informed Crucially though this telos can only be articulated in a language of permanent deferral and in what constitutes a diametrical reversal of Aristotelian thought is being defined by the absence of any specific norms or contents rather than by the practical acknowledgment of their suprapersonal authority5 Pfaus quarrel with this mode of historicism as you will have already gathered is not just methodologicalnot just for example with the selfimposed restriction of recent models of inquiry to tightly localized and circumscribed chronotypes biographically con ceived time spans the punctum of this or that local event dates of publication etc 7 It is also ideological insofar as such an approach ultimately reproduces a decisivealbeit unexamined and doubtful axiom that underwrites    the political and economic projects of clas sical Liberalism and their subsidiary rhetoric of emancipation prog ress growth and political rights 7 Given the extensive discussion in the last chapter it hardly needs saying that this linkage between methodology and ideology has particular resonance in the context of animal studies where the same concept of rightsnamely in the form of animal rightshas been crucial to the emergence and consolida tion of the very field that now is eager to move beyond that paradigm What also drops out in many manifestations of contemporary literary historicism if we believe Ellen Rooney Susan Wolfson and others who contributed to the special MLQ issue of 2000 on The animal studies New Formalism is the questionone might even say the very disciplinarityof reading and not just in the narrow sense of reading literary forms such as the sonnet or the novel As Rooney puts it The effects of the attenuation of the category of form include the reduc tion of every text to its ideological or historical context or to an exem plar of a prior theory content    and the generalization of reading asparaphrase which robs cultural and literary studies of the power to make any essential contribution to critical work already moving confidently ahead in history sociology anthropology and communica tions These are all disciplines that have long since mastered the art of readingassummary reading sans form6 Admittedly we would do well here to keep in mind Marjorie Levinsons reminder that it is useful in such cases to distinguish between new his toricism and new historicism7between many of the founding first generation texts of New Historicism by Stephen Greenblatt Jerome McGann and others which were she argues quite demonstrably concerned not just with the articulation of form and historical content but also with questions of the aesthetic and of pleasure 56061 and the work of those hapless followers and mere practitioners 560 as one critic puts it which treats the textany text be it poem novel Supreme Court ruling political speech or advertisementas merely a site for mining content an alibi sufficient to get the machinery of archaeology and archivechurning up and running 561 Surely Rooney is right that the real issue here is not to transcend the New Historicism poststructuralism cultural materialism or any of the other critical interventions marking literary studies in the late twentieth century 18its not about picking your favorite brand name and taking sides in other wordsbut to engage the question of disciplinarity in literary and cultural studies what they can contribute specifically that could not be handled just as well or better by other fields such as history or sociology or philosophy As she puts it for a critical reader bereft of the category of form the subject matter of lit erary and cultural analysis loses all standing as a theoretical object an object situated and at work in a critical or disciplinary field 1819 To raise the question of cultural studies in this context though only brings the problem into sharper focus for as Rooney points out animal studies that field is perhaps even more intractably caught than literary criti cism in the dilemma of defining its own proper form it is a welter of competing and even incompatible methods and a quasi disciplin ary form increasingly difficult to defend intellectually or politically 21 Indeed if we believe Tilottama Rajan cultural studies isnt part of the solution its part of the problem and like the historicism criti cized by Pfau it is one with identifiable ideological contours In Rajans view in fact cultural studies in the United States and North America the United Kingdom and Australia would require somewhat different analyses as she rightly animal studies observations on historicisms textasparaphrase by observing that the teleology of the new cultural studies under the guise of pluralism is of absolute selftransparency based on total communicability9 Cultural studies thus involves a repurposing of reading and thinking it is a pragmatic use of the humanities within a modular structure that appears to promote dissidence by its pluralism of content and identities but instead interpellates minority identities and localisms into a disciplinary complex 77 Thus for example Bhabhas concepts of alterity and migrancy rather than exerting a critical force that is radically heterogeneous toradically other thanthe liberal socius and its ruling protocols instead become recontained as pluralism by cultural studies normalizing ideological function for civil society Though civil society contains diverse subgroups it mediates their an tagonisms holding together different classes and interests by provid ing their members with recognition 76 And hence Rajan argues disciplines of slow thought committed to the nontransparency of these relationships become relegated to the margins of cultural studies symptomatically reflected in the turn away from poetry in literary and cultural studies as she shrewdly animal studies put an even finer point on itthe disciplinary hegemony of histori cism becomes nothing more or less than an exercise in the very pre sentism that historicists routinely lay at the doorstep of theory Indeed as Rooney observes one result of this lack of theoretical reflection by the dominant modes of historicism is that ironically enough they be come an unwitting echo of the earliest epoch of literary studies in that thematic analysis has become virtually the sole mode of formal analysis effectively at work in literary and cultural studies 28 Does this mean that there is no such thing as good histori cism Of course not as Levinsons careful distinction between new historicism and new historicism ought to make clear But it does mean that any historicism needs to confront the difference between historicity and historicismthat is to say the difference between the material institutional forces it is interested in and the modes and protocols of knowledge by which those materials are disciplined by which they are given form protocols that are by definition always already reductive not just in the strict epistemological sense of being selective but also in the empirical terms favored by historicism it self Indeed as none other than Franco Moretti has pointed out with regard to the project of literary history the majority of books dis appear foreverand majority actually misses the point if we set todays canon of nineteenthcentury British novels at two hundred titles which is a very high figure they would still be only about 05 percent of all published novels11 As Moretti animal studies of historicism in US literary and cultural studies is Marxist aesthetics Marxism grappled as no other contemporary body of thought has with precisely the questions that occupy literary and cultural historicists today particularly those who think of themselves as politically pro gressive namely the ideological and political function of culture in relation to economic infrastructures civil society and the relations of national and international contexts both geopolitical and economic as they bear on those questions13 This is not to say of course that figures such as Lukács Brecht Adorno Macherey Althusser Bloch Mannheim and others agreed at all on these issues Rather it is to remind us that the dubious practices of paraphrase reading for theme privileging the biographical and the generational chronotope the local context and so onand most importantly the instrumentalization of cultural forms as a mere vehicle for sociological or historical content that plague contemporary literary and cultural studies received inten sive scrutiny for decades in Marxist theorys debates over socialist real ism the ideological and political character of modernism and its formal experimentation as in the socalled BrechtLukács debate and much else besides And yet this remarkable body of work does not inform the landscape of current historicist practice in literary and cultural studies in the United States in any fundamental way Rajan sees the role of theory in the current context in rather dif ferent terms but likewise finds its signal value in denaturalizing dis ciplinary formations its ability to exercise a destabilizing antisystemic force in relation to disciplinarity in generala kind of asystasy to use a term she borrows from Schelling14 that unworks the Idealism and imperialism of any practice including theory itself 80 She finds this project of an asystatic deployment of fields of knowledge to un settle one another inherited and sustained by Michel Foucault in his early work but in a historically specific articulation one that prevents the gesture toward theory from becoming a master discourse As she reminds us The Order of Things denaturalizes and decenters disciplines not only in response to the crisis of the university as a culture and insti tution in late 1960s France one whose disciplinary forms hamstrung its ability to respond to the social crisis at hand it also culminates in a criticism of the human sciences the modern academys bridging of the humanities and social sciences under the form of a corporate animal studies merger 81 Foucaults analysis of the emergence of the disciplines is in a word antiideological What Are Disciplines I want to supplement Rajans account of Foucaults work on discipli narity with John Rajchmans to make a slightly different point one whose stakes will only gradually come into focus in the remainder of the chapter A crucial emphasis of Foucaults early work is this If we take the question of disciplinarity seriously we have to first of all admit that disciplines do not derive their constitutive protocols from their objects of attention Quite the contrary disciplines constitute their objects through their practices theoretical commitments and methodological proceduresand they do so quite selectively This is a seemingly simple point but it is one as we shall see with farreaching consequences From the early 1960s to the late 1970s in The Order of Things The Archaeology of Knowledge and Discipline and Punish Foucault undertakes what Rajchman calls nominalist historiesnot histories of things but of the terms categories and techniques through which certain things become at certain times the focus of a whole configura tion of discussion and procedure15 He thus seeks to challenge the universal objective and progressive image of unified science inher ited from the Enlightenment and instead embarks on an attempt to discover an irreducible plurality of territories and objects of knowl edge characterized by anonymous tacit procedures an account that emphasizes the relative autonomy of discourses 53 Two further and very important consequences flow from this commitment First this means that there is no such thing as society as a whole 55 since the idea of a whole and universal society has now been dis persed into a range of different practices discourses and disciplines 59 Secondsince one of Foucaults great objects of analysis is the group of techniques terms and categories that concern the subject this means that Foucaults work continues and indeed intensifies twentiethcentury challenges such as Heideggers or Wittgensteins to the postCartesian philosophy of the subject 52 In scrutiniz ing the various kinds of systems through which people have come animal studies to identify themselves as subjects Foucault in short undertakes a trenchant posthumanism on the terrain of the subject to match his antiuniversalism in the domain of the object16 We can extend and sharpen Foucaults account of disciplinary for mations with Niklas Luhmanns more recent work on social systems In doing so I hope to make some headway on what James Chandler has recently characterized as the need to rearticulate the disciplinary system after three decades of add on fields and programs To do so Chandler suggests we must work toward a better understanding of how the scheme of the disciplines might be said to compose a system a project that he likewise finds powerfully initiated in Foucaults work17 Like Foucault Luhmann does not make individuals the fundamental constitutive elements of society like Foucault he is therefore suspi cious of the universalist vocation of the intellectual18not because as in Foucault such an understanding would mitigate against our capacity to find alternatives to the particular forms of discourse that define us by uncovering the particularity and contingency of our knowledge and our practices 60 but because for Luhmann such universalism desirable though it may be is actually impossible under modernity now understood as a process of functional differentia tion For Luhmann as for Foucault then society as a whole cannot be said to existnor can by extension the public sphere in anything like the classical sensebut what Luhmann is able to articulate more clearly and at the same time more radically is how these twin claims no social holism no universal intellectual do not amount to reject ing science as such or criticizing all rational discourse 59 Rather it means for Luhmann that the form of rationality itself under modernity is paradoxicaland paradoxical in ways that produce precisely what Rajan calls the asystasy in and through which disciplines destabilize and expose each other Now it may seem odd to invoke systems theory in this context given that both Pfau and Rajan despite their vast intellectual differ ences think of the idea of system and its companion idea informa tion as the apotheosis of everything their accounts of disciplinarity aim to critique19 This is so I think because both are operating with a concept of system and of adjacent terms such as information that is markedly out of date one that would apply to the firstorder systems animal studies theory of the 1950s Norbert Wiener for example but not to the work in secondorder systems theory of Maturana and Varela Heinz von Foerster Luhmann and others Indeed for these thinkers the concept of system might best be described to use a concept from Adorno to which both Pfau and Rajan would be amenable as an effort to think detotalized totality In fact as Dirk Baecker puts it in a passage I in voked in the opening chapter systems theory after the secondorder turn may best be understood as an attempt to do away with any usual notion of system the theory in a way being the deconstruction of its central term20 To put it this wayand I will amplify the point in chapters 8 through 10is simply to remember why Luhmanns work is particularly interested in the core problematic of romanticism for mulated by Kant and Hegel that occupies both Pfau and Rajan21a problematic it attempts to redescribe in a context well articulated by Derridas observation that the critique of historicism in all its forms seems to me indispensable    The issue would be can one criticize historicism in the name of some thing other than truth and science the value of universality omni temporality the infinity of value etc and what happens to science when the metaphysical value of truth has been put into question etc How are the effects of science and of truth to be reinscribed22 This is precisely the project I would argue that Luhmann undertakes in his later work which becomes more and more philosophical if you like in both of the senses invoked by Pfau and Rajan as a universalizing discourse Pfau that retotalizes differentiation seriality specialization and so on in terms of a kind of normativity and systematicity produced by modernity as fundamentally a form of functional differentiation and as a theory of the contingency and constructedness of knowledge that detotalizes philosophys idealism and imperialism in the terms de scribed by Rajan Hans Georg Moeller summarizes this quite well Luhmanns relation to philosophy can    be compared to Hegels rela tion to religion as expressed in the Phenomenology of Spirit For Hegel religion was with respect to its highest purpose a thing of the past    Neither its semantics nor its general structure could be fully accepted any longer    Its essence had to be expressed in a more selfreflective way in a language and in a form that represented a higher understanding23 animal studies Similarly for Luhmann philosophy had become with respect to its highest purpose a thing of the past and so what Luhmann unabash edly calls a supertheory of society a theory of universal relevance can no longer be housed in philosophy given philosophys disciplinary norms and protocols24 Hegels Aufhebung from religion to philosophy now becomes Luhmanns from philosophy to theoryand this move ment is driven as Luhmann repeatedly insists by historical forces Like Hegels scheme Moeller writes Luhmanns claims to be thor oughly conceptualized and to return to its beginningin other words a coherent whole instead of a linear argument25 Unlike Hegels how ever Luhmanns theory acknowledges its own contingencythat is it acknowledges its modernity that it is itself a product of functional differentiation Or as Moeller observes What a supertheory says has to make general sense to it But this sense itself is not general it is con tingent on the theory that is constructing this horizon of sense in the first place26 With this background in mind we can now move to investi gate in more detail Luhmanns radicalization of the analysis of disci plinarity carried out in Foucaults early workone made possible by Luhmanns crucial turn in his middle and late work to the theory of autopoiesis as key to understanding social systems As we saw in the opening chapter Luhmann appropriates the concept from the work in biology of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to make sense of the seemingly paradoxical fact that systems are both open and closed to exist and reproduce themselves they must maintain their boundar ies and integrity through a process of selfreferential closure and it is only on the basis of this closure that they can then engage in struc tural coupling with their environment27 Like neurophysiological au topoietic systems their fundamental logic is recursive they use their own outputs as inputs in an ongoing process of selfmaking or self production and they constantly reproduce the elements that in turn produce them In Luhmanns scheme disciplinary formations would strictly speaking be viewed as elements of the social system called education but I believe they may be profitably thought of as subsystems that fol low the same systemic logic which both produce and depend on their own elements for their autopoiesis journals conferences research animal studies groups protocols of advancement and recognition etc From this vantage disciplines would deploy the distinction that is fundamental to all systemsthe distinction systemenvironmentbut would articulate it in their own specific form thus and this is a basic postu late of systems theory using it to reduce and process the overwhelm ing complexity of an environment that is by definition always already exponentially more complex than any particular system itself As we saw earlier this selectivity does not however indicate solipsism Quite the contrary for as Luhmann puts it in Social Systems selfreferential closure does not contradict the systems openness to the environment Instead in the selfreferential mode of operation closure is a form of broadening possible environmental contacts closure increases by constituting elements more capable of being determined the complex ity of the environment that is possible for the system 37 As we saw in chapter 1 the adaptive pressure to develop a highly selective codea pressure generated by the systems inferiority in complexity in comparison with the environmentleads in turn to an increasing internal differentiation within the system itself The sys temenvironment distinction is then repeated internally in the system so that for example the entire legal system now becomes the environ ment for the various legal subsystems which must themselves respond to or achieve resonance with the broader changes in the legal sys tem itself In building up their own internal complexity through in creased internal differentiation systems are able to enhance their abil ity to respond to a rapidly changing environment by in a sense slowing it down Increased selectivity buys time But in doing soin increasing their environmental resonance by building up their own internal com plexity by simply doing what they dosocial systems create more complexity in the environment of other systems even as they try to reduce it for themselves 177 hence the nearly paradigmatic situation associated with postmodernity hypercomplexity28 For Luhmann then as we know from our earlier discussions all observations whether by the legal system the economic system or any other are contingent and selective constructions and reductions of an environment that cannot be grasped holistically or in any total izing fashion This means that there is no given environment out there that can be cognitively approached or represented in its total animal studies ity What this means is not only that all systems and all observations are selfreferential it also means that paradoxically the difference be tween selfreference and external reference or heteroreference is itself a product of selfreference in the same way that the outside of the environment is always the outside of a specific inside This fact how ever cannot be observed by the system that at the same time wants to use that distinction to carry out its operations That observation can only be made by a secondorder observer using a different code in this case education which likewise must remain blind to the paradoxi cal nature of its constitutive distinction which can only be disclosed by another observer and so on and so forth As Luhmann points out The designations that usually register this state of affairs are relativ ism conventionalism constructivism One can summarize the mean ing of these concepts in the thesis of a loss of reference But if this is to be taken as a again paradigmatic critique of postmodernity such a critique assumes a position of totalization that is by definition no longer available in the context of modernity understood as functional differ entiation This thesis marks their negative content Luhmann contin ues Its negativity however only arises in a historical comparison with the premises of ontological metaphysics with its religious safeguards its cosmos of essences and its normative concept of nature29 Several important consequences may now be drawn from Luhmanns analysis First as was already clear in Foucaults work dis ciplines take their specificity not from the objects of their attention but from the specific protocols of their discourses Foucault their commu nications and observations Luhmann Or as Luhmann puts it in some what different terms a first step toward the comprehension of moder nity therefore consists in the distinction between problems of reference and problems of truth30 The disarticulation of reference and truth thus helps us understand in turn a crucial second point how the object of disciplinary knowledge is not therefore lost under modernitys loss of reference but is rather in a very real sense greatly enhanced As Luhmann puts it in the introductory chapter to Social Systems One can now distinguish the systemenvironment difference as seen from the perspective of an observer eg that of a scientist from the systemenvironment difference as it is used within the system itself animal studies the observer in turn being conceivable himself only as a selfreferential system Reflexive relationships of this type dont just revolutionize the classical subjectobject epistemology    they also produce a very much more complex understanding of their objects via a very much more complex theory design 9 In a process that Luhmann calls semantic overburdening the system being observed is covered over with a procedure of reproduc ing and increasing its complexity that is impossible for it In its analysis science uses conceptual abstractions that do not do justice to the ob served systems concrete knowledge of its milieu or to its ongoing self experience On the basis of such reductionsand this is what justifies themmore complexity becomes visible than is accessible to the ob served system itself    In this sense it overburdens its objects self referential order    This overburdening is immanent in every observa tion 56 To put it another way it is not just unavoidable but crucial and immensely productive to keep open the difference between first and secondorder observation to insist on a nonreductive relation of prob lems of reference and problems of truth to remember with Maturana that the internal mechanisms of an observed phenomenon and a second order observation of them intrinsically take place in independent and non intersecting phenomenal domains31 All observations then may be carried out only on the basis of selfreferential closure but that closure because it produces both environmental complexity and semantic overburden ing produces more possibilities for connection more openness This analysis helps us understand in turn a third crucial point that disciplinary differentiation or specialization is not something to be lamented avoided or overcome rather universalization can be achieved only through specification32 This is the tenor in which I would like to hear Immanuel Wallerstein and his coauthors in the recent report Open the Social Sciences when they write The claim to universality however qualified    is inherent in the jus tification of all academic disciplines That is part of the requirement for their institutionalization The justification may be made on moral prac tical aesthetic or political grounds or some combination thereof but all institutionalized knowledge proceeds on the presumption that the lessons of the case at hand have significant bearing on the next case and that the list of potential cases is for all practical purposes endless33 animal studies When Wallerstein and his coauthors say universalizing the read ing I want to suggest is not totalizing which is likely Wallersteins own but the sense voiced in Rajchmans reading of Foucault when he suggests that history doesnt exist for Foucaultnot because its not real but because there is no one thing all our histories are about even though there may seem nothing about which we cannot write a history34 Fourth and finally given everything we have just said it is clear that just as disciplinary formations are not constituted by objects but by communications Foucaults discourses neither are they consti tuted by persons For Luhmannand this seems less counterintuitive after revisiting Foucaultthe fundamental elements of social systems are not people but communications In fact as Dietrich Schwanitz suggests The individual human being belongs to each of these func tionally differentiated subsystems for only short periods of time with only limited aspects of his person depending on his respective role as a voter pupil reader patient or litigant It is his fundamental exclu sion from society that allows the occasional reentry of the individual under particular circumstances    Modern society develops a seman tics of individuality that regards the individual as alien unfamiliar unpredictable and free35 This means we can say that people can participate in interdisciplinarity even if disciplines cant only if we are willing to give up the traditional notion of person Only that is if we become posthumanist Locating the Animal of Animal Studies or Posthumanism So how does all of this affect our view of animal studies in relation to the question of disciplinarity especially the disciplinarity of literary and cultural studies In my view it means that we should not try to imagine some superinterdiscipline called animal studies an understandable desire of course for all who work on cultural studies of nonhuman animals but rather recognize that it is only in and through our disci plinary specificity that we have something specific and irreplaceable to contribute to this question of the animal that has recently captured the attention of so many different disciplines not something accurate to contribute but something specific and there is a world of difference animal studies between those two claims What we need then is not interdisciplin arity but multidisciplinarity or perhaps transdisciplinaritybut a trans disciplinarity understood not to take one recent formulation as a critical evaluation of terms concepts and methods that transgresses disciplinary boundaries as a means to a higher level of reflexivity one that accepts the task of making itself transparent by thematiz ing the conditions of its own speech Rather we need to understand transdisciplinarity as a kind of distributed reflexivity necessitated as we have just seen by the fact that by definition no discourse no dis cipline can make transparent the conditions of its own observations36 In this sense transdisciplinarity means a distributed network of first and secondorder observers disciplines that precisely by doing what they do call into questionand are called into question by other disciplinary formations Such is the case as we saw in the last chapter in Cora Diamonds suggestion that literature confronts phi losophy with the degree to which philosophys characteristic modes of thinking about our moral responsibilities to animals are in fact evasions or deflections of a traumatic question that in some profound sense defies thoughta trauma that philosophy attempts to mitigate by turning it into a problem of propositional argumentation Or to take another example as I argued in chapter 2 literary studies has an important role to play in showing how the theory of language typically relied on in cognitive scienceand how that theory is typically related to questions of consciousness and cognitionsmuggles back into the category of subjectivity the very Cartesianism that cognitive science says it wants to overcome by means of its resolutely functional mode of analysis37 To say that an object of study will actually be enriched by the ongoing differentiation of disciplines is not however to invoke a tepid pluralismfar from it As Luhmann points outand here he defines in a nutshell the incoherent epistemological and ideological core of much work in contemporary cultural studiesthe laziest of all com promises is to agree on pluralism This both begins and avoids the deconstruction of the distinction between subject and object We con cede to each subject its own way of seeing its own worldview its own interpretation as with the reader of Wolfgang Iser but only in a frame work that at the same time allows for the objective world text and animal studies so forth38 Instead a better way to imagine some ever more complete or thorough representation of nonhuman animals via interdisciplinary practice is to recognize as I have been suggesting that the enrich ment of the object of study via semantic overburdening can only happen by means of disciplinarity and its differences This may be what is falsely called relativism but it is also what under the conditions of modernity is called knowledge Crucial to a posthumanist understanding of disciplinarity then and to posthumanism in general I would argueis the fundamental principle of openness from closure that Luhmanns work helps us theorize that taking seriously the phenomena of selfreference and au topoietic closure in disciplinary systems leads not to solipsism but quite the contrary to the ability for the system to increase environmental contacts and in the process produce more environmental complexity for other systems which in turn challenges other disciplines to change and evolve if they want to remain resonant with their changing envi ronment This marks an entirely differentbecause posthumanist valence from a fundamental assumption endemic to many contempo rary discussions of interdisciplinarity that even if disciplines cant transcend disciplinary closure people can As one critic writes on behalf of interdisciplinarity and a fairly standard set of desires associated with it disciplinary practice becomes a productive rather than a reproduc tive environment when in the spirit of critical reflection meanings and values of traditional pedagogy can be scrutinized    The inter subjectivity of meaning can be exposed he continues and educational institutions the classroom the discipline and the university can be seen to construct and condition knowledge In this way literary study as the study of textuality    reveals the epistemological structures that organize how we know how our knowledge gets transmitted and ac cepted and why and how students receive it39 But as Foucault would surely be the first to point outand here he would follow in the footsteps of his teacher Louis Althussers cri tique of Antonio Gramscis humanismsuch a picture appealing as it may be relies on the fantasy of a subject who escapes the constitutive blindness that is the contingency and selectivity that in fact makes knowledge possible Critical reflection in other words names the ability to pick up and put down disciplinary discourses at will without animal studies being bound by them to master without being mastered by the fini tude of knowledgeall ironically enough in the services of ostensi bly identifying various forms of finitude that overdetermine disciplin ary practice In reinscribing the familiar figure of the human as the subjectofreflection such a view reproduces an entire set of assump tions and protocols that are not just intellectually but also ideologically specific as both Pfau and Rajan among many others have pointed out In so doing it constitutes the reverse of what I have been trying to derive from the FoucaultLuhmann account of disciplinarity not the openness from closure that results from taking the selfreference and autopoiesis of disciplinarity seriously but rather closure from openness or rather apparent openness in the reproduction of a liberal human ist subject who then on the basis of reflection undertakes various forms of pluralism More important for the topic at hand such a picture of critical consciousness and its ability to rise above disciplinary and discursive finitude actually closes off the human from the nonhuman and thus reinstates the humananimal divide in a far less visible but far more fundamental way while ostensibly gesturing but only gesturing be yond humanism itself40 And it is the status structure and tacitly gov erning set of assumptions of that form of subjectivityand not just the range of its content and its interests however putatively progressive multicultural or antianthropocentricthat must be fully examined To use Derridas terms it is a question as we saw in the last chapter of the precise nature of the auto of the autobiographical animal the concept of the human that the human falsely gives to itself to then enable its recognitionfrom a safe ontological distance as it were of the nonhuman other in a gesture of selfflattering benevolence wholly characteristic of liberal humanism As I argued in detail there equally important for understand ing the relationship of disciplinarity to subjectivity that I have been discussingand this is the point usually overlooked in Derridas later work on the question of the animalis that there are two kinds of fini tude here under which the man of the humanities labors and more over that the first type physical vulnerability embodiment and even tually mortality is paradoxically made unavailable inappropriable to us by the very thing that makes it available namely a second type of not animal studies being able a second type of finitude that we experience in our subjec tion to the radically ahuman technicity of language understood in the broadest sense of any semiotic system This last fact as we have seen has profound consequences for what we too hastily think of as our concepts our readings our histories which are therefore in an impor tant sense not ours at all If literary and cultural studies are interested in sign systems of all kinds in their formal material and semantic aspects as one would presume them to be then they must I am arguing con front the enormous implications of this fact for their disciplinarity What Derrida enables us to formulatebut so does Luhmann in a different registeris that yes it is true that what we think of as personhood knowledge and so on is inseparable from who we are from our culture discourses and disciplines but at the same time we are not we we are not that auto of autobiography that human ism gives to itself As we saw in the previous chapter equally im portant for the topic of animal studies is Derridas insistence that this second type of finitudethe estranging prostheticity and exteriority of communicationis shared by humans and nonhumans the moment they begin to respond to each other by means of any semiotic system in the most rudimentary sensean assertion also clearly shared by Luhmanns unequivocal postulate that problems of autopoietic self reference do not apply to humans or to consciousness or even to bio logical or organic systems alone41 In different registers and with different objectives then Derrida Luhmann and Foucault help us clarify the pointand the ethical stakes of the point if we believe Derridathat many of the confusions sur rounding the question of interdisciplinarity stem from the fact that we continue to think the question in terms of persons and a subject centered semantics that is precisely in terms of humanism The vir tue of paying attention to the thinkers I have been discussing is not only do they make it clear that disciplines arent persons they also make it clear that persons arent persons in the sense of the definition of person that humanism gives to itself And it is here at this precise juncture that animal studies becomes a subset of the larger problem atic of posthumanism All the foregoing helps to clarify I hope two crucial and often misunderstood aspects of posthumanism as I use the term first that it animal studies is not antihistorical but only antihistoricist in the sense I have outlined and second that it is not posthuman or antihuman but rather simply posthumanist As for the first as I have already suggested on the heels of Marjorie Levinsons useful distinction between new historicism and new historicism the distinction humanismposthumanism is com pletely asymmetrical in fact to the distinction historicismformalism To insist that the difference between historicity and historicism be rec ognized as we saw Franco Moretti suggesting earlier is simply to in sist that if the past is far more heterogeneous and complexfar more ahuman and strange as the Annales school heldthan the accounts of it we have inherited it is also true that the present from which those accounts issue as products of specific practices and protocols is hetero geneous to itself in ways actively repressed by the recasting of a vast historical cultural and anthropological field within the protocols of humanism and the subject of knowledge it reproduces in and through those protocols As for the second pointthat posthumanism is anti or post humanmy sense of posthumanism does not partake of the fantasy of the posthuman described by N Katherine Hayles which imagines a tri umphant transcendence of embodiment and privileges informational pattern over material instantiation so that embodiment in a biological substrate is seen as an accident of history rather than an inevitability of life42 On the contrary as Derridas point earlier suggests it requires us to attend to that thing called the human with greater specificity greater attention to its embodiment embeddedness and materiality and how these in turn shape and are shaped by consciousness mind and so on It allows us to pay proper attention with Maturana and Varela to the material embodied and evolutionary nature of intelligence and cognition in which language for example is no longer seen as it is in philosophical humanism as a wellnighmagical property that on tologically separates Homo sapiens from every other living creature Rather it may now be viewed as an essentially non or ahuman emer gence from an evolutionary processwhat Maturana and Varela call the emergence of linguistic domains from larger processes of social interaction and communication among animals including but not lim ited to Homo sapiens That radically ahuman evolutionary emergence in turn makes possible language proper and the characteristic modes animal studies of consciousness and mentation associated with it but remains tied as in body language kinesics and more general forms of symbolic semi ology to an evolutionary substrate that continues to express itself in human interaction43 And yet everything I have just said would not be possiblewould be literally unthinkablewithout readily identifiable models concepts terms and so on disciplinary developments in information theory cog nitive ethology semiology to name just a few that are distinctly mod ern disciplinary products with their own particular histories and devel opments of the sort described by Foucault in The Order of Things Thus we find ourselves in a strange but inescapable loop in which our abil ity to understandmore fully and more thickly than humanismthe human depends on posthumanist theoretical and methodological innovations that end up revealing to paraphrase Lyotard that the post human comes both after chronologically and before as its robust mate rial embodied and evolutionary condition of possibility the human of humanism44 What we find after humanism as it were is what we might call turning Adornos famous phrase upside down not the pre ponderance of the object but the preponderance of the subject What I want to locate here then is a second crucial and indeed determina tive dimension in which the question of posthumanism is central It is not just as Neil Badmington and others have rightly observed that the post of posthumanism does not and moreover cannot mark or make an absolute break from the legacy of humanism45 It also means that while we may share Hayless view that various visions and versions of the triumphantly disembodied posthuman such as Hans Moravecs continue to rely on indeed imperialize a liberal humanist view of the self46 we must also recognize that there are liberal humanist ways of engaging in this very critique Does this mean then that posthumanism as I am using the term is simply a thinly veiled synonym for systems theory or de construction Not at all as the signal impact of that discipline called science in the context of animal studies ought to make clear But it does mean as the quotation from Derridas Eating Well on scien tific knowledge earlier suggests that science though it appears to eschew a subjectcentered semantics can avoid its own form of ideal ism only if it confronts the fact as Luhmann puts it that science can animal studies no longer comprehend itself as a representation of the world as it is and must therefore retract its claim of instructing others about the world It achieves an exploration of possible constructions that can be inscribed in the world and in so doing function as forms47 This does not mean of course that the knowledge thereby produced is worthless or cannot have operational value on the contraryas Bruno Latour for instance would be the first to suggestit can have operational value and effectivity only because it is such a reduction of complexity This means in turn that the break between transcendental idealism and radical constructivism 67 recognizes the fact of polycontextur ality to use Gotthard Gunthers term that is that the distinctions trueuntrue and selfreferenceexternal reference are not only to be distinguished but also as Luhmann puts it are located at right an gles to each other They have no mutually unbalancing effects 6548 From this vantage then posthumanism can be defined quite specifically as the necessity for any discourse or critical procedure to take account of the constitutive and constitutively paradoxical nature of its own distinctions forms and proceduresand take account of them in ways that may be distinguished from the reflection and intro spection associated with the critical subject of humanism The post of posthumanism thus marks the space in which the one using those distinctions and forms is not the one who can reflect on their latencies and blind spots while at the same time deploying them That can only be done as we have already seen by another observer using a different set of distinctionsand that observer within the general economy of autopoiesis and iterability need not be human indeed from this van tage never was human It is only on this basis which is not strictly speaking a basis at all but a nonplace a form of difference that a firstorder observer the subject in humanist parlance is opened and unavoidably so to the alterity of the other not by taking thought or by benevolent reflection but by the very conditions of cognition and communication conditions that in their constitutive blindness gen erate the necessity of the other This is why even though animal studies may be viewed as in one sense just another field it is in the sense I have just described not just another field On the one hand it could certainly be seen as what James Chandler calls the latest incarnation of a subdisciplinary field animal studies one of a whole array of academic fields and practices that since the 1970s have come to be called studies gender studies race studies and cultural studies of course but also film studies media studies jazz studies the list is virtually endless49 But for the reasons I have been outlining I think we must also see animal studies as not just another in the long list of fillintheblank studies itemized by Chandler Its not just that I want to resist the homogenizing force of such a designation which suggests that what are radically different problems constituen cies and formations are somehow equivalent nor is it only because of all the reservations some of which I noted earlier that the designa tion studies invites Rather the point I want to emphasizeand it is one obscured by the generic moniker of studies which occludes the crucial link between the two forms of finitude we examined a moment ago that reside at the heart of animal studies in a uniquely determining wayis that one can engage in a humanist or a posthumanist practice of a discipline and that fact is crucial to what a discipline can contribute to the field of animal studies For example just because a historian devotes attention to the topic of nonhuman animalslets say the awful plight of horses used in com bat operations during World War Idoesnt mean that humanism and anthropocentrism arent being maintained and reproduced in his or her disciplinary practice insofar as the disciplinary subject doing the history remains isolated from the viral effects of the second form of finitude and all its implications that I discussed earlier And insofar as that is the case that disciplinary practice undermines on a second level what looks like an antianthropocentric endeavor because its form of disciplinary subjectivity is founded on a constitutive repression of a less visiblebut for that very reason all the more fundamentalbond between human and nonhuman animals as beings who not only live and die as embodied beings but also communicate with each other in and through a second form of finitude that encompasses the humananimal difference form ing a bond that is all the more powerful because it is unthinking and in a fundamental sense unthinkable So even thoughto return to our historian exampleyour concept of the disciplines external relations to its larger environment is posthumanist in taking seriously the exis tence of nonhuman subjects and the consequent compulsion to make the discipline respond to the question of nonhuman animals foisted on animal studies it by changes in the disciplines environment your internal disciplinar ity may remain humanist through and through We may now thento move toward a conclusionsuggest a more overarching schema in which such a procedure might be called humanist posthumanism locating itself at one corner of a plane in which the Y axis denotes external relations  humanismanthropo centrism and the X axis denotes internal disciplinarity  humanism anthropocentrism Such a schema is not meant to be exhaustive of course merely indicative nor does it preclude recognizing that the desirability of a given position in such a schema must be contextual ized I suggest for example that if you are interviewing with the local newspaper about animal overpopulation in your community and you want to win over readers to your point of view you would do well to gravitate toward the internal disciplinary discourse that character izes the humanist end of the spectrum In this view the designation humanist posthumanism would apply as well as I have argued else where to the Kantian animal rights philosophy of Tom Regan the utilitarian animal liberation position of Peter Singer or the capabilities approach of Martha Nussbaum in Frontiers of Justice50 Meanwhile at the diagonally opposed corner of this schema posthumanist human ism would consist of being posthumanist in internal disciplinarity but humanist in the continued external insistence on the ethical and broadly speaking ontological efficacy of the humananimal divide Hereto stay for the moment only with figures about whom I have writtenone might think of the work of a Richard Rorty or a Slavoj Žižek For example Rortys strident antifoundationalism his critique of both philosophical realism and idealism as shared forms of repre sentationalism his rejection of the view of philosophy as the mir ror of nature surely kicks the props out from under the humanist subject of knowledge in its disciplinary practice Yet Rortys liberalism finds in such a deconstruction of philosophical representationalism no charge to rethink the hierarchy of humananimal as animals remain excluded as anything but presumably derivative or indirect sub jects of justice from the liberal conversation about political ends to which philosophy for Rorty is clearly subordinated51 As for Žižek his wellknown attacks on liberal multiculturalism in general and on neopragmatism in particular which are surely right animal studies as far as they go would seem to separate him decisively from a figure such as Rorty52 Žižeks disciplinary antihumanism would be located not in his antifoundationalism but rather precisely in his attack on anti foundationalisms evasion of the more fundamental fact identified by Lacan of Truth as contingentnot as constructed or relative in the sense associated with neopragmatism but as the radical senseless ness of the Lacanian Real which as Lacan famously put it resists sym bolization absolutely53 And yet to realize as I have argued elsewhere that in Žižek the animal is always already simply a metonymy either for the Lacanian Real or in the case of pets for the Symbolic is to real ize that although Žižek maintains a resolutely antihumanist account of the relationship between thought psychic formations and language or the Symbolic he is nevertheless humanist and anthropocentric in his inability to rethink what I have called the distribution of subjectiv ity across species lines54 As for Foucault his account of disciplinarity and his own disciplinary practice would appear to be posthumanist for reasons I have already discussed at some length Yet Foucaults external relations to humanism are difficult to assess at this pointnot only be cause of some striking differences between his earlier work my focus Fourfold disciplinarity humanist versus posthumanist internal versus external INTERNAL DISCIPLINARITY RELATIONS EXTERNAL Posthumanist Humanism Humanist Humanism Posthumanist Posthumanism Humanist Posthumanism  HUMANISM  HUMANISM  HUMANISM Foucault Rorty Zizek Heidegger Rawls Habermas Derrida Luhmann Latour MaturanaVarela Haraway Ferry Nussbaum Regan Singer  HUMANISM ˇ ˇ animal studies here and his later investigations of the care of the self in which a certain humanism returns to the fore if we believe Žižek55 but also because we are just beginning to be able to understand the full implica tions of Foucaults concepts of biopower and biopolitics for transspecies relations As for the category of humanist humanism that perhaps needs little elaboration because nearly all our social and political institutions and most of our public intellectuals take such a formation for granted I might cite hereagain among those I have written aboutHabermas Rawls and Luc Ferry And that leaves posthumanist posthumanism which has to do with understandingand understanding the conse quences ofthe very redefinition of what humanistic knowledge is after the disciplinary subjectivity at its core the notion of the human that it gives to itself has been rewritten along the lines I have been exploring here in the work of Derrida and Luhmann and elsewhere in the work of Deleuze and Guattari Bruno Latour Donna Haraway and Maturana and Varela In short the external or ahuman forces that his toricists and formalists alike in literary and cultural studies presume to constitute the always already post of their posthumanism politi cal institutions economic infrastructures geopolitical and strategic configurations and events but also social institutions and conventions such as art forms and their genres and media modes of domesticity and intersubjectivity and the like must always be conjugated within a second kind of externality and ahumanitya second kind of finitude that as Derrida helps us see fatefully binds us to nonhuman being in general and within that to nonhuman animals as the very condition of possibility for what we know and for sharing it with another It is in other words a question of locating the animality of animal studies in this case I would wager where one might least expect it Animal Studies Disability Studies and Who Comes after the Subject Of the various contemporary fields of interdisciplinary cultural studies that emerged over the past decade two of the most philo sophically ambitious and ethically challenging are animal studies and disability studies Both are often taken to be the latest chapters in the academic assimilation of the socalled new social movements civil rights feminism environmentalism gay and lesbian activism and so on that have fundamentally reshaped the study of society and culture over the past thirty years or more As we saw in some detail in chapter 3 part of what makes animal studies significant and disability studies is no different in this respect is that it poses fun damental challenges as these earlier movements have to a model of subjectivity and experience drawn from the liberal justice tradition and its central concept of rights in which ethical standing and civic inclusion are predicated on rationality autonomy and agency That agency in turn is taken to be expressive of the intentionality of one who is a member of what Kant called the community of reasonable beingsan intentionality that is taken to be more or less transpar ent to the subject itself Part of my aim in this chapter is to extend the argument of chap ter 3 to the question of disability with an eye toward gleaning what ani mal studies and disability studies have to teach each other about who or what comes after the subject as it is modeled in liberal humanism1 Both animal studies and disability studies show us something about the limitations of this model and in doing so call on us to rethink ques tions of ethical and political responsibility within what I have been characterizing as a fundamentally posthumanist set of coordinates2 In the wake of this after new lines of empathy affinity and respect between different forms of life both human and nonhuman may be lear ning from temple gr andin realized in ways not accountable either philosophically or ethically by the basic coordinates of liberal humanism Both animal studies and disability studies have intersected in what has recently emerged as a small subfield of its own authors who claim that their condition has enabled for them a unique understand ing of nonhuman animals and how they experience the world The most famous of these is probably Monty Roberts the famed horse whisperer who was born with a severe form of color blindness called achromatopia that allows him to see only blacks whites and a remark ably subtle scale of grays3 For that very reason however he developed early in life a keen perception of movement that has allowed him to read the body language of horses with amazing subtlety and precision4 Then there is the case of Dawn PrinceHughes who claims that her ex perience with Aspergers syndrome enabled her to have an unusually keen understanding of the nuances of the social interactions and com munications of a group of zoo gorillas As with Monty Roberts this was crucial for the evolution of her own selfunderstanding enabling her to move from being a wild thing out of context living on the margins of society to completing a PhD in anthropology and eventu ally to becoming an author and editor Gorillas she says taught me how to be civilized5 And then there is the case I will be discussing here Temple Grandin who reflects on her life with autism in three books published over the past nineteen years Grandinan animal science PhD who has designed onethird of all the livestockhandling facilities in the United Statesinsists that her experience with autism and its specific characteristics the intensely visual rather than verbal quality of her mental life the acute sensitivity to tactile stimulation and so on has given her a special understanding of how nonhuman animals experi ence the world one that has enabled her to design animal holding and processing facilities that are far more humane for the animals involved I am less concerned with evaluating Grandins assessment of her own case and its broader implicationsan assessment that is often prob lematic in my viewthan with mobilizing her observations about her experience toward my own critical ends Grandins story was first brought to national attention by Oliver Sacks in an article published in the New Yorker in 19946 The opening lines of Sackss foreword to Grandins second book Thinking in Pictures gesture toward what makes her case so instructive for my purposes Sacks calls Grandins first book Emergence Labeled Autistic unprece dented and in a way unthinkable because there had never before been an inside narrative of autism unthinkable because it had been medical dogma for forty years or more that there was no inside no inner life in the autistic or that if there was it would be forever denied access or expression7 As we saw in chapter 2 that dogma is founded in no small part on the toorapid assimilation of the questions of subjectivity conscious ness and cognition to the question of language abilitya dogma that is perhaps even more entrenched in the humanities and social sciences than in areas such as medicine Indeed as many scholars have argued the shibboleth where there is reason there is a subject morphs in the twentieth century into where there is language there is a subject8 In this light the title of Grandins second bookThinking in Pictures would constitute an oxymoron even for some fairly sophisticated con temporary philosophers of consciousness and cognition such as our example in chapter 2 Daniel Dennett as she herself lear ning from temple gr andin objects that move suddenly Grandin observes Ive seen cattle that were handled in two identical facilities easily walk through one and balk in the other The only difference between the two facilities was their orientation to the sun 22 And not surprisingly cattle respond sharply to small visual stimuli that humans dont even registera length of chain dangling from a feedlot fence a reflection in a puddle of water on the runway to a dip vat a crumpled white plastic bottle rocking in the wind 143 Grandin insists in her most recent book Animals in Translation that being a visual thinker was the start of my career with animals    because animals are visual creatures too Animals are controlled by what they see When I say Im a visual thinker she continues I dont mean just that Im good at making architectural drawings and de signs    I actually think in pictures During my thinking process I have no words in my head at all 17 In fact she often characterizes her mental processes in terms of a videotape library or CDROM that she scans for specific images which then get languaged and narra tivized in a secondorder process My mind is like a web browser she writes in one article When I lecture the language is mostly down loaded out of memory from files that are like tape recordings I use slides or for many animals not the dominant one and on the other hand the opposed register of the technical and mechanical Temple Grandin as recording storage and playback device as she describes it I will ex plore in greater detail in chapter 7 this essentially prosthetic nature of the visual and its implications but for now I want simply to note that in Grandins story in other words visuality may be animal it may be technical but it is anything but humanall the more so paradoxi cally enough for being so accurate and acute A corollary of thisand I will return to this question in some detail in the next two chapters as wellis that what we think of as normal human visuality does not seeand it does not see that it does not see Here we should remember especially from chapter 1 how the theory of observation and its necessary blind spot as developed by Niklas Luhmann and others serves as a posthumanist rejoinder to hu manisms trope of visualityasmastery that I referenced a moment ago But we could also be more down to earth and simply note that this not seeing is crucial to the human beings and to any beings organization of an overwhelming flood of visual input into a field of meaning We might recall in this connection Grandins discussion of a well known set of experiments exploring what is called inattentional blind ness in humans Daniel Simons the head of the Visual Cognition Lab at the University of Illinois showed test subjects a videotape of a group of students in a hallway moving about and passing two basketballs to and fro and asked the test subjects to count the number of passes made After the tape has been rolling for a while a person a woman in a gorilla suit walks onto the screen faces the camera beats her chest with her fists and then leaves What is remarkable is that 50 percent of those watching the tape do not even register the person in the go rilla suit even when prompted later specifically about it Its not that they dont remember seeing it exactly its that they apparently never registered seeing it in the first place But the point I want to stress is that this blindness takes place because of an entire framework of so cially conditioned expectations about meaning and the visual field10 As Grandin summarizes it Its not that normal people dont see the lady dressed in a gorilla suit at all its that their brains screen her out before she reaches consciousness 65 Moreover research suggests as Grandin puts it that inattentional blindness works at a high level of lear ning from temple gr andin mental processing meaning that your brain does a lot of processing be fore it allows something into consciousness 66 What we have here then are two different kinds of notseeing The first is the transformation by normal subjects of an unstruc tured flood of sensory input into a semiotically organized visual field of meaning which itself depends not only on biological constraints particular the organism but also on an entire set of socialsymbolic conventions forms and expectations The second by contrast is Grandins abnormal hyperacute almost photographic visuality that does not organize and harmonize objects in the visual field in terms of reason literally their ratio but instead gets mired visually hiccup ping if you will in a heterogeneous flotsam of particularspuddles shocked with glare bright lengths of dangling chainnone of which becomes furniture for the eye as agent of ratio or logos We will examine in some detail in chapter 7 the nature of such a visual field in relation to questions of prostheticity and the filmic me dium but here I want to index it to what Jacques Derrida in Memoirs of the Blind calls the ruin of vision11 In Derridas terms it is the blind the disabled who see the truth of vision It is the blind who most readily understand that the core fantasy of humanisms trope of vision is to think that perceptual space is organized around and for the look ing subject that the pure point of the eye as agent of ratio and logos exhausts the field of the visible that the invisible is onlyindeed merelythat which has not yet been seen by a subject who is in prin ciple capable of seeing all Over and against thisas one might already guess by my discus sion of the spectral in relation to photography and film in chapter 3 Derrida argues that the invisible is not simply the opposite of vision not simply its negative image the visible in waiting already there but simply as yet unseen Ratherand this should retain considerable resonance for my critique in chapter 7 of a certain representationalist notion of vision in contemporary artspace is not essentially mas tered by livré a the look as Derrida puts it12 He elaborates the point in a difficult passage from Memoirs of the Blind the opening gestures of which have particular resonance for Grandins hypervisuality a visual registration of objects that is so detailed and acute that the viewed ob ject itself becomes strangely opaque In order to be absolutely foreign to the visible and even to    the pos sibility of the visible this invisibility would still inhabit the visible or rather it would come to haunt it to the point of being confused with it    The visible as such would be invisible not as visibility the phe nomenality or essence of the visible but as the singular body of the vis ible itself right on the visibleso that by emanation and as if it were secreting its own medium the visible would produce blindness    To be the other of the visible absolute invisibility must neither take place elsewhere nor constitute another visible that is something that does not yet appear or has already disappeared    This nonvisible does not describe a phenomenon that is present elsewhere that is latent imagi nary unconscious hidden or past it is a phenomenon whose in appearance is of another kind13 The invisible then remains heterogeneous to the visible a spatial ization of the visual as Derrida calls it that is quite obviously at work for example not only in the autistics blinding visuality but also in the radical asymmetries and heterogeneities among all the different lifeforms who seeand for that very reason do not seein specific ways because of their neurophysiological constraints After all does it make sense to say that a ringtailed lemur does not see the object of the bats echolocation That a starfish does not see the image in an in sects compound eye Moreover as Derrida observes in the context of philosophy and ethics from its first words on Metaphysics associates sight with knowledge but he insists that we must also know how to hear and to listen I might suggest somewhat playfully that we have to know how to shut our eyes in order to be better listeners14 This decentering of sight is all the more important because as he reminds usin a passage that has considerable resonance with his critique of the humanist subject as a creature of abilities and capabilities that we examined in the previous two chaptersthe modern dominance of the principle of reason had to go hand in hand with the interpretation of the essence of beings as objects an object present as representation Vorstellung an object placed and positioned before a subject This lat ter a man who says I an ego certain of itself thus ensures his own technical mastery over the totality of what is15 To reframe the question of the visual in this wayto cut it loose from its indexical relation to the human to reason and to the lear ning from temple gr andin representational mastery of space itself and set it adrift within the gen eralized animal sensorium as merely the equal of the dogs sense of smell or the horses sense of touch and in some contexts inferior to thoseis to appreciate more fully Derridas observation that a de hierarchization of the senses displaces what we call the real that which resists all appropriation16 And it provides a useful context for hear ing the philosophical as well as zoological resonance of Grandins at tention to the specificity and intensity of other forms of sensory experi ence For example she the sides of the chute against her At first she writes there were a few moments of sheer panic as I stiffened up and tried to pull away from the pressure    Five seconds later I felt a wave of relaxation and about thirty minutes later I asked Aunt Ann to release me For about an hour afterward I felt very calm and serene 63 The magnitude of the experience for Grandin is hard to exaggerate This was the first time she writes I ever felt really comfortable in my own skin 63 This extraordinary sensitivity to touch and pressure is a quite common phenomenon with autistics Grandin reports and even though the sense of touch is often compromised by excessive sensi tivity it can sometimes provide the most reliable information about the environment 65 In extreme cases autistics actually have severe problems locating the boundaries of their own bodies One patient in a book about her own famous case reports that she could only per ceive one part of her body at a time and had no sense of it as forming a whole unit and she tapped rhythmically and sometimes slapped herself to determine where her body boundaries were 66 In fact Grandin suggests that the wellknown behavior of some nonverbal au tistics of constantly tapping and touching things may be an effort to figure out where the boundaries are in their environment like a blind person tapping with a cane 66 The autistics body boundary problem is at the core of another remarkable moment in Thinking in Pictures which dramatizes in an es pecially powerful way many of the themes I have been discussing thus far Grandin was hired to redesign an extremely cruel system used for the kosher slaughter of cattle replacing it with a chute that would gen tly hold the animal in a standing position while the rabbi performed the final deed It worked best when I operated the hydraulic levers unconsciously like using my legs for walking she writes I had to force myself to relax and just allow the restrainer to become part of my body    Through the machine I reached out and held the animal When I held his head in the yoke I imagined placing my hands on his forehead and under his chin and gently easing him into position Body boundaries seemed to disappear    The parts of the apparatus that held the animal felt as if they were an extension of my own body similar to the phantom limb effect    During this intense period of lear ning from temple gr andin concentration I no longer heard noise from the plant machinery    Everything seemed quiet and serene It was almost a religious experi ence    I was able to look at each animal to hold him gently and make him as comfortable as possible during the last moments of his life    A new door had been opened It felt like walking on water 4142 Now many things could be said about this passage18 but for the mo ment I would simply like to draw our attention to how here disability becomes the positive indeed enabling condition for a powerful experi ence by Grandin that crosses the lines not only of species difference but also of the organic and inorganic the biological and mechanical In a kind of dramatization of the category meltdowns identified ca nonically in Donna Haraways Cyborg Manifesto disability here positively makes a mess of the conceptual and ontological coordinates that Grandins rendering of the passage surely reinstates rhetorically on another level This realizationthat what we traditionally think of as disability can be a powerful and unique form of ablednessis a fundamental as sumption for recent work in disability studies19 Here however I want to interpret the significance of this moment in Grandins work and her case in general in a way that diverges from some of the dominant paradigms of recent disability studies At first blush the most obvious way for animal studies and disability studies to make common cause might seem to be within a shared liberal democratic framework which as philosopher Luc Ferry puts it counts on the progress of the equality of conditions to gradually increase the sphere of legal rights and ethical recognition In this viewand this is essentially the procedure of Martha Nussbaums Frontiers of Justice discussed in chap ter 3nonhuman animals and the disabled would be seen as simply the latest traditionally marginalized groups to have ethical and legal enfranchisement wholly or partially extended to them in an expand ing democratic context that entails what Nancy Fraser has called the politics of recognition20 But a fundamental problem with the liberal humanist model is not so much what it wants as the price it pays for what it wants that in its attempt to recognize the uniqueness of the other it reinstates the normative model of subjectivity that it insists is the problem in the first place I am not suggesting that working to liberalize the interpreta time or that lobbying to upgrade animal cruelty prosecutions from misdemeanor to felony status is a bad thing What I am suggesting is that these pragmatic pursuits are forced to work within the purview of a liberal humanism in philosophy politics and law that is bound by a historically and ideologically specific set of coordinates that because of that very boundedness allow one to achieve certain pragmatic gains in the short run but at the price of a radical foreshortening of a more ambitious and more profound ethical project a new and more inclusive form of ethical pluralism that it is our charge now to frame That proj ect would think the ethical force of disability and nonhuman subjectiv ity as something other than merely an expansion of the liberal human ist ethnos to ever newer populations as merely the next room added onto the increasingly opulent and globalizing house of what Richard Rorty has called the rich North Atlantic bourgeois democracies21 Derrida is especially forceful on this point in a recent interview on what he has called the question of the socalled animal which we explored in chapter 3 For the moment he suggests we ought to limit ourselves to working out the rules of law droit such as they exist But it will eventually be necessary to reconsider the history of this law and to understand that although animals cannot be placed under con cepts like citizen consciousness linked with speech    etc they are not for all that without a right Its the very concept of right that will have to be rethought Derridas point here is not just the obvious one that we cannot expect animals to be able to enter into an expressly juridical contract in which they would have duties in an exchange of recognized rights but ratherand more pointedlythat it is within this philosophicojuridical space that the modern violence against ani mals is practiced a violence that is at once contemporary with and indissociable from the discourse of human rights And from this van tage it makes perfect sense to conclude as Derrida does that how ever much sympathy I may have for a declaration of animals rights that would protect them from human violence it is nevertheless prefer able not to introduce this problematic concerning the relations between humans and animals into the existing juridical framework22 In disability studies the accent falls within a somewhat different vector of the liberal humanist framework To borrow the distinction lear ning from temple gr andin used by Paola Cavalieri which she borrows in turn from G J Warnock if animal rights discourse typically focuses on the status of the moral patient disability discourse tends to focus equally on the question of the moral agent As Cavalieri puts it If the moral agent is a being whose behavior may be subject to moral evaluation the moral patient is a being whose treatment may be subject to moral evaluation23 In disability discourse in other words the emphasis falls on the right of the disabled to subjectivity of a particular and circumscribed type sub jectivity as agency Against this background we can more fully appreciate Cora Kaplans observation in a recent collection on feminism and disability that human anomaly    continues to trouble the rhetoric of liberal individualism testing both its ethics of tolerance and its fetishization of autonomy and agency as conditions of human status and civic par ticipation Viewed from a long term perspective she continues the continuing debate about the rights of citizens and the price of increased agency for them is itself a legacy of liberalisms historically mixed messages about autonomy and social justice an ongoing paradox that remains as radically unresolved in the liberalisms that character ize latetwentiethcentury social democracies as it did in the classic liberalism of the nineteenth century24 What Kaplan calls the fetishization of agency endemic to the liberal concept of subjectivity is everywhere on display in a recently published collection of papers in PMLA from a highprofile conference at Emory University in March 2004 Disability Studies and the University In the introduction to the collection for example the authors trumpet the fact that we have the right to leave the hospital and travel the earth that people with disabilities are on the move after years of being probed and studied disabled people have begun themselves to probe and study and now emerge not as objects of study but as knowledge producers25 Here obviously enough the valences of the normal liberal subject active not passive subject not object of knowledge producer not prod uct and so on are called on to validate and legitimize the subjectivity of the disabled and the rallying cries are taken from the playbook of liberal citizenship access rights privileges participation This fetishization of agency in disability studies is understand able of course for all sorts of historical institutional and strategic reasons As participants in the Emory conference regularly note the trajectory of disability studies in the academy has been closely linked to the legal struggles of the disabled for basic needs such as access to public spaces human services and the like At the same time how ever it is interesting to see that some of the participants call for dis ability studies to move beyond the familiar theoretical models and or thodoxies of its past The activist and author Simi Linton for example argues that we need to grapple with the absence of an overarching term that subsumes everyonethe vector on which disability falls She suggestsafter the divisive strategies of the past which sought to stake out and hold on to the specificity of disability as a category which would resist seeing obesity for example as a disabilitythat we now need to find a new way of talking about the place of disabled people in the universe and to find the place of disability in some uni versal26 Similarly Lennard Davisone of the founding figures of disability studies in the academic humanities in the United States argues from a somewhat different vantage that the template of identity politics that characterized much early work in disability studies must be abandoned If disability studies is to remain viable he argues it will have to incorporate into its collective vision the kind of complexi ties with which postidentity theory is grappling27 What I have been suggesting of course is that Grandins ex ample of the relationship between disability and transspecies affinity directs us toward the possibility of taking up just this sort of project in a more profound and I think ultimately broadbased way a way that we can begin to understand in light of Derridas insistence that there is not one opposition between man and nonman there are between different organizational structures of the living being many fractures heterogeneities28 But underneath them all as we have seen in earlier chapters is a shared finitude a shared passivity to use Derridas term that runs directly counter to the liberal model of the subject as above all a creature of volition autonomy and agency of power or capability pouvoir and attributes avoirs being able having the power to give to die to bury ones dead to dress to work to invent a technique29 But the blockage in disability studies on this pointto return now to the papers from the Emory conferenceis remarkable to say lear ning from temple gr andin the least and that blockage short circuits the sort of project that both Linton and Davis in their different ways call for In fact in all the essays collected in the special PMLA issuethey make up 143 double column pagesnot once does the relationship between disability and transspecies affinity in this broader ethical project come up though Grandin herself is mentioned at least once The most pointed irony of all perhaps occurs in Rosemarie GarlandThomsons essay where she observes that although we value biodiversity in our environment we devalue physical and mental variety30 Here GarlandThomson would seem to echo Derridas contention that the problem with the phrase the Animal is that within the strict enclosure of this definite article    are all the living things that man does not recognize as his fellows his neighbors or his brothers And that is so in spite of the in finite space that separates the lizard from the dog the protozoon from the dolphin the shark from the lamb the parrot from the chimpan zee31 Similarlyor at least apparently soGarlandThomson argues for applying the vibrant logic of biodiversity to humans But even as she echoes Derridas reading of the significance of Benthams question can they suffer in her recognition that our bodies need care we all need assistance to live that our society emphatically denies vulner ability contingency and mortality32 she is unable to recognize that these ethical imperatives extend across species lines and bind us in our shared vulnerability to other living beings who think and feel live and die have needs and desires and require care just as we do Most ironic of all in this light is one example she offers of recent positive changes in images of disability in mass culture a magazine cover of a stereotypical tall slender female model dressed in evening gown for a night on the town but accompanied by a German Shepherd service dog She writes The juxtaposition of the elite body of a visually normative fashion model with the mark of disability forces the viewer to reconfigure assumptions about what constitutes the attractive the de sirable and the livable life 526 Yes but only at the expense of doing to nonhuman differents what normates have traditionally done to the disabled Now I want to stress that my point here is not to play the old est and most predictable trump card in the identity politics deckmy constituents are more marginalized and unrecognized than yours but rather to suggest that instead of seeing the nonhuman animal as liberal society and its values wouldnt we do better to imagine this example as an irreducibly different and unique form of subjectivity neither Homo sapiens nor Canis familiaris neither disabled nor nor mal but something else altogether a shared transspecies beinginthe world constituted by complex relations of trust respect dependence and communication as anyone who has ever trainedor relied ona service dog would be the first to tell you33 What I have in mind then is a different sort of project one that is consonant with the suggestion made by the editors of a recent col lection on disability and postmodernism that work associated with poststructuralism can contribute an enormous amount to the develop ment of inclusive societies which is surely as important as the challenge to the hegemony of normativism that is more typical of mainstream work in disability studies34 As they rightly argue existing theories of disabilityboth radical and mainstreamare no longer adequate    considering the range of impairments under the disability umbrella considering the different ways in which they impact on individuals and groups over their lifetime andparticularly to the point for my pur poses hereconsidering the intersection of disability with other axes of inequality 15 Such a project points us toward the necessity of an ethics based not on ability activity agency and empowerment but on a compassion that is rooted in our vulnerability and passivitythis nonpower at the heart of power as Derrida puts it In this light the ethical force of our relation to the disabled and to nonhuman others is precisely that it foregrounds the necessity of thinking ethics outside a model of reci procity between moral agents indeed as thinkers from Levinas and Lyotard to more recently Zygmunt Bauman have argued the ethical act might instead be construed as one that is freely extended without hope of reciprocation by the other As Bauman puts it the problem with an ethics based on reciprocity is that it implies calculability of action What more than anything else sets the contractually defined behavior apart from a moral one he continues is the fact that the duty to fulfill the duty is for each side dependent on the other sides record    It is so to speak in the power of my partner to set me by design or by default free to unbind me from my duties But those duties he lear ning from temple gr andin argues are heteronomic my relation to the Other is programmatically nonsymmetrical that is not dependent on the Others past present an ticipated or hopedfor reciprocation Hence all ethical models based on reciprocity and contractualism ignore the fact that we becomes a plu ral of I only at the cost of glossing over the Is multidimensionalitya multidimensionality that cannot be calculated that is a radically em bodied form of finitude not only of the disabled and of nonhuman sub jects but also of the normate subject itself now returned to itself as other with a new sense of its own nonnormative contingency35 I will end then on a very different note from what one typically finds in calls for animal rights and disability access one that returns us to the transvaluation of the trope of vision as an index of humanism with which the chapter began It looks forward as we will see to the next two chapters and will recall I hope my discussions in chapter 3 of J M Coetzees riveting fiction as read by Cora Diamond At the end of Memoirs of the Blind Derrida writes We all know about the episode in Turin    where Nietzsches com passion for a horse led him to take its head into his hands sobbing    Now if tears come to the eyes if they well up in them and if they can also veil sight perhaps they reveal in the very course of this experience    an essence of the eye    The eye would be destined not to see but to weep For at the very moment they veil sight tears would unveil what is proper to the eye And what they cause to surge up out of forgetful ness    would be nothing less than    the truth of the eyes whose ulti mate destination they would thereby reveal to have imploration rather than vision in sight to address prayer love joy or sadness rather than a look or a gaze    The blindness that opens the eye is not the one that darkens vision The revelatory or apocalyptic blindness the blindness that reveals the very truth of the eyes would be the gaze veiled by tears 12627 II Media Culture Practices This page intentionally left blank From Dead Meat to GlowintheDark Bunnies The Animal Question in Contemporary Art This chapter begins at the intersection of two questions one apparently quite complicated the other apparently quite simple The first questionexplored in some detail in the first half of the book concerns the ethical standing of at least some nonhuman animals It is a question with which we are confronted every day in the mass media indeed entire cable television networks are now built around the presumption of its possibility and it has increasingly captivated not just scientific fields like cognitive ethology ecology and cognitive science but also areas in the humanities such as philosophy psycho analysis theory and cultural studies generally For the purposes of this chapter I will assume that the ethical standing of at least some nonhuman animals is not just a live issue but one increasingly taken for granted even if how to formulate that ethical standing remains a complex question I allow myself this luxury in no small part because the two artists whose work I will be addressing take that standing for granted as they have affirmed in a variety of contexts The second question seems by comparison much more straight forward and perhaps almost trivial in comparison to the weight of the first but that is part of the reason I want to take it up here When con temporary artists take nonhuman animals as their subjectour treat ment of them how we relate to them and so onwhat difference does it make that those artists choose a particular representational strategy anda question I cant fully explore herea particular medium or art form such as painting sculpture installation or performance to name just a few To put this more directly there clearly has been in contemporary art an explosion of interest in what Derrida calls the question of the animal as theme and subject matter1 When address ing this topic however it is all too easy to fall into what Slavoj Žižek from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies with characteristic astringency has in another context called an un dialectical obsession with content2 What I am interested in on the other hand is how particular artistic strategies themselves depend on or resist a certain humanism that is quite independent of the manifest content of the artwork the fact that it may be about nonhuman ani mals in some obvious way In the contexts of the visual and visuality that I developed in the previous chapter and will continue to excavate in the chapter that fol lows we can bring the question I have in mind into even sharper focus along the following lines If as many of the most important contem porary thinkers have suggested certain representational strategies say the Renaissance theory of perspective or Benthams panoptical rendering of architectural space or the production of the gaze and spectatorship in film as critiqued by feminist film theory in the 1980s and so on can be indexed to certain normative modes of humanist subjectivity that they reproduce by the very nature of their strategies then we are well within our rights to askto put it succinctly for the momentwhat the relationship is between philosophical and artistic representationalism These are precisely the sorts of questions that practicing artists routinely engage in connection with the specific demands of particular representational media They bear very directly on not just the artis tic challenge but also the larger philosophical and ethical challenge of speaking for nonhuman animals speaking to our relations with them and how taking those relations seriously unavoidably raises the ques tion of who we are of the notion of the human that as we saw in chapter 3 the autobiographical animal to use Derridas phrase gives to itselfa question that may be answered quite indirectly not in the manifest content of the artwork or its message but in its formal strategies The Ethics of Disfiguration Sue Coes Dead Meat We find many faces in the paintings and drawings collected in Sue Coes book Dead Meat a collection of sketches paintings and drawings that Coe compiled over a sixyear period while traveling to slaughter houses and feedlots around North America3 Hundreds of faces even from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies thousands perhaps And we dont have to find them They find us As in Cow 13 or Pigs in a Circle they stare out at us on nearly every page by turns fearful afflicted or innocent What is remark able here though is that the faces belong mainly to the animals livestock so called In fact it is hard to find a human being with a face at all and when we do find them as in Electrocution or There Is No Escape they are usually misshapen or contorted How are we to understand this One way that suggests itself immediately is by means of the theo rization of the ethics of the face in contemporary philosophy and theorya debate that has conspicuously involved Emmanuel Levinas Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari among others Levinas theorizes the ethical call of the face as the site of an unanswer able obligation to which I am held hostage to use his term in an infinite responsibility to the other As Derrida has observed however though the subject is held hostage to the other by the first imperative of the intersubjective relationthou shalt not killin Levinas as in the JudeoChristian tradition generally this is not understood as a thou shalt not put to death the living in general For Levinas the subject is man whose ethical standing is secured by his access to both logos and the Word and so as Derrida puts it in Levinas the subject resides in a world where sacrifice is possible and where it is not forbidden to make an attempt on life in general but only on the life of man4 As we have seen earlier however for Derrida the animal has its point of view re garding me The point of view of the absolute other and nothing will have ever done more to make me think through this absolute alterity of the neighbor than these moments when I see myself naked under the gaze of a cat5 And from the vantage of Deleuze and Guattari Derridas critique of Levinas here might be viewed as leaving intact a certain humanist schema of the scopic and the visual which their critique of faciality in A Thousand Plateaus is calculated to dismantle in its insistence that the face is not a location still less a body part but rather a kind of grid or diagram that configures the space of inter subjective relations and desire itself making them available only at the expense of fixity and identity6 To put it schematically Deleuze and Guattari might well ask of Derrida how the moment of being looked at by his catnot just naked but seeing myself naked under the gaze from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies of a catcan be divorced from the face How can the lookingback of the animaland the ethical call harbored by that lookbe disengaged from the humanism for which the face and faciality generally is per haps the fundamental figure The art historian and critic Michael Fried gives a rather differ ent account of the face from the Levinasian one in his book Realism Writing Disfiguration On Thomas Eakins and Stephen Crane where he offers an analysis of figuration and representation that will help to shed light on the particularity of Sue Coes strategies and how we might assess their ethical force7 The key point of contact with the motifs we have sounded out thus far however briefly is readily voiced in the title of the essay on Crane that makes up the second half of Frieds book Stephen Cranes Upturned Faces where the intense visuality of Cranes prose is also indexed to the faceand to the blank page as its double or standinand its ethical call on us Pertinent here too is the fact that in Crane in Eakins and in Coe we will be dealing withimmersed in reallyscenes of violence and responsibility pri marily war as in Cranes The Red Badge of Courage the surgical theater of Eakins great painting The Gross Clinic and of course the killing floors of Coes Dead Meat What Fried finds in Crane is a mode of literary representation that involves a major emphasis on acts of seeing both literal and meta phorical8 But what is usually called Cranes impressionistic style should instead be understood Fried argues as a remarkable plumb ing of the relationship of a primitive ontological difference between the allegedly upright or erect space of reality and the horizontal space of writing which manifests itself in Crane as an implicit con trast between the respective spaces of reality and literary represen tation 99 This difference is related to the extraordinary and ex traordinarily haunting and even uncanny network of faces in Cranes fictionprimarily faces of the dead that stare back at us with unseeing eyesby virtue of the requirement that a human character ordinarily upright and so to speak forwardlooking be rendered horizontal and upwardfacing so as to match the horizontality and upwardfacingness of the blank page 99 On the one hand and here the connection to Coes animal faces is quite clear the faces of the deadlike the blank pagestare back at us and ask for our conferral of meaning through from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies representation on their abjection or suffering this is rendered in an especially powerful way in Cranes war fiction But at the same time as figures for the unnatural process of writing itselfwhen the upwardfacingness of the corpse hence of the page is considered not so much as a brute given but as a kind of artifactthey are products of that very process of representation itself 100 In trying to bring the readerviewer face to face with the world through writing however the writer only succeeds in defacing the world or to use Frieds term disfiguring it The dilemma in Crane is that the more he succeeds in this enterprise the more he in another sense fails This is so Fried argues because insofar as those deseman ticizing aspects of Cranes writing visuality sonority dialect and manipulation of perceptual scale just to name a few do their job they interpose themselves in their own materiality between the reader and the world that that realist project was supposedly intended to repre sent so that the world though he doesnt put it this way almost be comes a host if you will for an essentially vampiristic relationship to the writerly or representational project As Fried asks Wouldnt such a development threaten to abort the realization of the impres sionist project as classically conceived In fact would it not call into question the very basis of writing as communicationthe tendency of the written word partly to efface itself in favor of its meaning in the acts of writing and reading 11920 For Fried this uncanny or vampiristic quality of Cranes style is symptomatic of Cranes need to performatively confront the scene of writing through a mechanism of displacement and to do so in a manner that positively obscured the meaning of those representations from both writer and reader And this suggests he continues that the passages that describe the faces and recount responses to them are where Cranes unconscious fixation on the scene of writing not only comes closest to surfacing in a sustained and deliberate manner but also precisely owing to the manifestly dreadful nature of the faces and of the vicissitudes that befall them is most emphatically repressed In other words the thematization of writing as violent disfigurement and its association with effects of horror and repugnance but also of in tense fascination allowed the writer and a fortiori the reader to remain unconscious of the very possibility of such a thematization 12021 from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies Coes handling of what we could call after Fried the scene of represen tation or figuration whose index in both cases is a certain rendering and in Cranes case rendingof the face We remember Frieds obser vation that a human character ordinarily upright and so to speak forwardlooking be rendered horizontal and upwardfacing so as to match the horizontality and upwardfacingness of the blank page 99 In Coe however we find a double reversal of this dynamic First the violence that in Crane renders the human corpse horizontal and facing upward is in Dead Meat associated with a force that takes the naturally occurring horizontality of the animals portrayed living as they do on all fours and renders it strongly verticalnamely in the endless rows and rows of hoisted hanging animal corpses in the slaughterhouse and the packing plant that we find in images such as Horse Slaughterhouse or Poultry Plant Fire It is as if the animals cannot be allowed to assume the vertical upright posture reserved as even Freud tells us in Civilization and Its Discontents for the human without at the same stroke being defacedin many cases quite literally ie beheaded At the same timea strict corollary by this logicthe slaughter house workers remain mired in a strongly horizontal plane and not surprisingly their faces are often beastly or animalistic in the tra ditional speciesist sense of the word as in Electrocution or Scalding Vat and Scraping Machine The logic that systematically works its way through most of these pieces then is that the concrete individual ani mal body an individuality emphasized in pieces such as Cow 13 and Goat outside Slaughterhouse is through a process of corporately organized Taylorization mechanistically born bred killed and dis membered in a process through which it comes to have meaning for the carnophallogocentric socius to use Derridas wellknown term only by being reconstituted as meat or porka semantic transfor mation and mystification that is itself paralleled by the material mani festation of identical shrinkwrapped packages of brightly colored meat in the grocery store counter now thoroughly dissociated from the reality of its material production9 And this systematic violence against the animals is itself doubled by a less brutal though no less systematic violence that attends the workers who are forced by the na from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies ture of capitalism itself to do such worka point graphically captured in Coes rendering of the meatpacking workers in painting after paint ing and explicitly thematized in works such as CapitalLabor Second howeverand this is the point I would like to empha sizewhat we find here is not the excruciated relationship to rep resentation that Fried emphasizes in Crane and Eakins but rather its apparent displacement onto forces external to the work of representa tion itselfforces whose effects the artwork registers and then inten sifies The violence we find here is not artifactual associated with the inescapable violence and disfiguration of representation itself  but is instead associated with the external that is to say extrarepresenta tional forces of capitalism and factory farming We could say in other words that in contrast to Frieds Crane Coes painting aspires to the condition of writing but writing understood not as representation di vided against itselfnot as différance or iterability to borrow Derridas terms which are invoked by Fried10but as the direct communication Sue Coe Goat outside Slaughterhouse PA 1990 Copyright 1990 Sue Coe Courtesy of Galerie St Etienne New York from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies of a semantic and as it were external content of which the artwork is a faithful or perhaps dramatic enough representation to didactically incite ethical action and change on the part of the viewer Yet precisely here an interesting problem manifests itself While Coe is certainly within her rights to see the ethical function of her art at least in one sense as drawing our attention as powerfully as possible to the untold horrors of the slaughterhouse on another leveland it is this level that will be handled with considerable sophistication I think in Eduardo Kacs workthat ethical function and the representational ism it depends on rely on a certain disavowal of the violence what Fried calls the disfiguration of representation itself which immediately leads to an obvious question we might ask of Coe If the ethical function of art is what Coe thinks it is why not just show people photographs of stockyards slaughterhouses and the killing floor to achieve this end To put it another way what does art add And what does it mean that her art has to be more than real to be real Isnt the melodrama of visi bility to use Frieds phrase that we find in Dead Meat which is calcu lated to give the animal a face also in another sense an effacement of the very reality it aims to represent one that quite conspicuously manifests itself in the hyperbole disfiguration and melodrama of Coes work The paradoxical result for Coes work then is that it appeals to us to read it as directly indeed melodramatically legible of the con tent it represents but the only way it achieves that end is through its figural excess which is precisely not of the slaughterhouse but of the interposing materiality of representation itself We can unpack the implications of this point by remembering Frieds discussion of what might be called a drama some would even say a melodrama of visibility in Eakinss The Gross Clinic which may be brought into sharp contrast with the very different melodrama we find in Coes Dead Meat project11 My point here in calling Coes work melodramatic is not that it exaggerates what really goes on in a slaughterhouse but that in Coes work nothing is hidden from us On the contrary the paintings seem to form a kind of theater calculated to produce a surefire effect to use Frieds characterization of theatri cality by playing to the audience as the figures in the paintings human and animalrepeatedly look out at us imploringly fearfully or sadistically as if the entire affair inside the space of the painting is from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies staged only for us12 Unlike the experience of the viewer in what Fried calls the absorptive tradition in painting that culminates in modern ist abstraction the viewer in Coes work isnt denied as Fried puts it but rather addressed and held responsible even culpable for what is being shown inside the frame Hereto return to The Gross Clinictwo conspicuous features of Eakinss painting noted by Fried are very much to the point the rendering of the surgical patients body and the cringing figure of an older woman usually taken to be the patients mother As for the first Fried from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies of the attitude toward the viewer that that rendering impliesan es pecially intense version of the attitude typical of what Fried elsewhere famously calls the absorptive tradition in painting 59 Similarly the cringing figure dramatizes the pain of seeing in both the emphatic emptiness of her clawlike left hand the violent contortion of which is apprehended by the viewer as a threatat a minimum an offense to vision as such and the sightlessness that    she so feelingly em bodies 62 In these aggressions as Fried calls them these gestures of disfiguration Fried finds in the painting an implied affront to seeing a stunning or worse a wounding of seeingthat leads me to imagine that the definitive realist painting would be one that the viewer literally could not bear to look at 6465 Here we get a precise sense of the differences between the force of disfiguration at work in Eakinss representationalism and in Coes In Coe although there is disfiguration aplenty it is never a disfigura tion that resists vision or interpretationquite the contrary it invites a single univocal reading The violence of Eakinss affront to seeing that manifests itself in The Gross Clinic as incision deformation and even in a sense dismemberment a violence displaced and contained by being thematized as Fried from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies and the surgeonpainter carefully and dramatically deliberates its vio lent application 88 In this light we might well say of Coes Dead Meat that the knives and hooks of the slaughterhouse are never associ ated with the brush of the painter and the violence of representation asdisfiguration Thus if Eakinss putative realism in fact harbors a deeper more unsettling antirealism or perhaps better irrealism Coes melodramatic renderings themselves harbor a more fundamental and a more fundamentally comforting representationalism a signifying re gime whose best name might well be facialityeven if that faciality extends across species lines to include even to privilege as if somehow to redeem their suffering the nonhuman animals around which the paintings are built The opposite of this regimeor more precisely as Derrida would put it that which remains heterogeneous to it not its simple other might well be figured in the network of asignifying forms and their se rial iteration that wends its way throughout the works collected in Dead Meat14 Chief among these are the chains hooks tubes belts hoses ducts and the like that form in pieces such as Horse Slaughterhouse McWorld and Pecking Order a kind of ongoing cipher in the paint ings often extending beyond the borders of the pictorial space suggest ing their intrication in some larger insidious networka logic that is also extended to cover the representation of the masses of animal bod ies themselves in pieces such as Lo Cholesterol Buffalo or Feedlot From Coes representationalist point of view this network is di rectly associated with the force of capitalism Taylorization and the disassembly line they put in place In the sense I am emphasizing here however we might see it as figuring instead a kind of displacement or domestication of the Derridean sense of iterability that I discussed in the first half of the bookor as Fried would have it a kind of visible repression that traces and scores the otherwise representational logic of the paintings This logic even extends I would suggest to the ubiquitous numbered ear tags that mark the animals as fodder in the larger ma chine of agribusiness and factory farming with the sheer abstractness and pure seriality of the numerical system signifying nothing except this force Here the painting Goat outside Slaughterhouse is all the more striking in the contrast between the almost sculptural modeling of the animals head and the abstract numbers of the contrasting ear tag which from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies network of figures I have just noted in pieces like Ham Scrubber Given the conceptual coordinates of Coes Dead Meat project we can surmise that this force of abstraction coding and seriality would eventually find its most extreme logical extension in genetic engineer ing and beyond that in cloningan eventuality graphically depicted in Coes painting Future Genetics Inc Here again however we can interpret this in a second sense rather at odds with the artists own While Coes painting depicts the perverse extension of Taylorized fac tory farming to the production of misshapen and deformed animal Sue Coe Ham Scrubber 1988 Copyright 1988 Sue Coe Courtesy of Galerie St Etienne New York from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies mutants in a subterranean laboratory there is another sense in which we may view this logic as endemic to representation itself The clone may be the image of the perfect servant the obedient instrument of the master creators will as W J T Mitchell puts it but it also acti vates the deepest phobias about mimesis copying and the horror of the uncanny double15 Or to put this in Derridas terms the dream of pure Taylorized seriality is repetition without difference but the very meaning of iterability is that repetitionand representationcan take place only in and through the potentially mutating work of difference the specific material embodied pragmatic instance that threatens any dream of purity always shadowing pure seriality with the uncanny referenced by Mitchell And this opens up a second ethical register around the question of representation and its logicone quite differ ent from what Coe has in mindthat harbors real stakes for how we understand the humananimal relation As we saw in chapter 2 Derrida has argued that the constitu tive fantasy of humanism is that the human separates itself from the rest of the domain of the living by alone escaping subjection to the deconstructive force of iterability and the trace that in fact extends to all forms of representation and signification not just its paradigmatic case language And in this second ethical register the critique of spe ciesism emerges in fact from the critique of representationalism along the lines traced by Derrida in Eating Well where he suggests If one reinscribes language in a network of possibilities that do not merely encompass it but mark it irreducibly from the inside everything changes I am thinking in particular of the mark in general of the trace of iterability of différance These possibilities or necessities without which there would be no language are themselves not only human    And what I am proposing here should allow us to take into account sci entific knowledge about the complexity of animal languages genetic coding all forms of marking within which socalled human language as original as it might be does not allow us to cut once and for all where we would in general like to cut 11617 This may seem to be a very different kind of cut from the ones we witness in Dead Meat but in fact Derrida suggests the sacrificial sym bolic economy of carnophallogocentrism that subordinates woman to man and nonhuman animals to both is directly related toeven from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies motivateswhat we witness in Coes work The subject does not want just to master and possess nature actively Derrida writes In our cultures he accepts sacrifice and eats flesh    In our countries who would stand any chance of becoming a chef dEtat a head of State of thereby acceding to the head by publicly and therefore exemplar ily declaring him or herself to be a vegetarian 114 The More You Look the Less You See Eduardo Kac In October 2001 Eduardo Kac presented his project The Eighth Day in a gallery at Arizona State University on the heels of what is probably his most famous undertaking GFP Bunny 2000 Here again Kac uses transgenic lifeforms in this case mice zebra fish tobacco plants and a colony of amoebae instead of a rabbit modified by introducing into them an enhanced GFP gene green fluorescent protein derived from the jellyfish Aequorea Victoria that makes them glow green under certain lighting conditions As in that earlier work however GFP lifeforms are only part of the story16 In The Eighth Day viewers enter a dark space with a glowing bluelit Plexiglas semisphere at its center surrounded by the sounds of waves washing ashore Inside the terrarium are the lifeforms just mentioned as well as a specially designed biobot which contains as its cerebellum the GFP amoebae When the amoebae move toward one of the six legs of the biobot their movement is tracked by a com puter which makes that particular leg contract The biobot also serves as an avatar as Kac puts it of Web participants who can remotely control its eye with a panandtilt actuator so that the overall perceiv able behavior of the biobot is a combination of activity that takes place in the microscopic network of the amoebae and in the macroscopic human network Meanwhile viewers in the gallery can see the terrarium from both inside and outside the dome by means of access to a Web inter face installed in the gallery space which includes in addition to a biobot view a feed from a birdseyeview camera installed above the dome17 When we leave behind the technical and logistical aspects of the piece which are considerable to address the works intellectual ethical and social implications we enter another order of complexity Arlindo Machados comments in the collection of essays that accompa nied The Eighth Day are fairly representative of these discussions from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies Transgenic forms of life are often stigmatized for being produced in the laboratory in part because of the economic and possibly warlike interests that motivate their creation It is almost inevitable that non technical discussions involving biotechnologies take on a conservative bias recalling scenarios of apocalyptic science fiction or even dogmatic interdictions of religious order    The more experimental and much Eduardo Kac The Eighth Day 2001 detail Transgenic artwork with biological robot biobot GFP plants GFP amoebae GFP fish GFP mice audio video Internet httpsprockettelabarticeduekac from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies less conformist sphere of artwith its emphasis on creation by means of genetic engineering of works which are simply beautiful not utili tarian or potentially profit making along with the relocation of geneti cally modified products in cultural spaces such as museums and art galleries or in public spaces or even in homes    all this could help to elevate public discussion of genetics and transgenics to a more sophis ticated level18 This is essentially the thrust as well of Kacs own manifesto on trans genic art but the artist takes the additional step there of insisting that artists can contribute to increase global diversity by inventing new life forms and he imagines a day in the not too distant future when the artist literally becomes a genetic programmer who can create life forms by writing or altering a given genetic sequence19 This insistence complicates an already complicated situation considerably because it invites the sorts of trepidations rightly raised by critics such as Steve Baker who writes that Kac engages with the animal through techniques that strike many people as meddlesome invasive and profoundly unethical20 Its not that any of the animals used in his work are harmed they arent and Kac has repeatedly made it clear how seriously he takes his responsibility for the care and well being of the animals involved but rather that Kac seems to overlook the larger picture as Baker puts it namely that his work depends on and in a fundamental sense reproduces an entire set of institutions and practices of scientific research that subject millions of animals a year to distressing often painful and usually fatal experimentation a subjec tion of nonhuman beings of unprecedented proportions as Derrida puts it in which traditional forms of treatment of the animal have been turned upside down and replaced by an artificial infernal vir tually interminable survival in conditions that previous generations would have judged monstrous21 Such concerns are very important of course but I dont want to pursue them further herein part because they have received ample air time in the discussions of Kacs work but primarily because cer tain habitual oversimplifications endemic to addressing those concerns have tended to mask crucial aspects of Kacs work features that have a less obvious and thematic relation to how his projects ethically in tervene in our received views of the humananimal relationship and from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies beyond that in the question of posthumanism generally Something of the different direction I want to pursue is evoked by Kac early on in the transgenic art manifesto where he writes More than making visible the invisible art needs to raise our awareness of what firmly remains beyond our visual reach but nonetheless affects us directly Two of the most prominent technologies operating beyond vision are digital implants and genetic engineering22 In a recent essay on art and human genomics the critic Marek Wieczorek extends the point when he asks How do we picture a new age of genetic manipula tion    a literal synergy between computing and biology This is not just a question of representation in any straightforward sense because the digital code of the genome emblematic of a new mode of con sciousness is not a spatial blueprint of life not a twodimensional plan of what a heart or liver looks like but a long string of nucleotides written in endless permutations23 What this means in turn is that the problem of picturing this immense revolution may not simply be a matter of new forms of visuality but rather demand reconciling form with principle24 Hereand this is rather a different understanding from what we find in FriedWieczorek finds a precursor to this new work of Kacs that thinks the parallels between art and scientific theory in mini malism with its potentially endless sequence of repeated shapes Just as digitally encoded information has no intrinsic relationship to the form in which it is decodedit is not tied to a singular inher ently meaningful formso in minimalism repetition replaces sin gularity Moreover in minimalism art acknowledges the viewer whose physical interaction with the work produces evershifting view points over time through a kind of feedback loop which parallels a similar emphasis in systems theory as we have seen in chapter 1 on the autopoiesis Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela or the selfreference Niklas Luhmann of the observing systema fact we will find Kacs work insisting on again and again most obviously in his inclusion in the work itself of remote Internetbased observer participants Here however the point is not as Wieczorek puts it that reflexivity is regressive much like the obsessively pointless varia tions of LeWitts incomplete open cubes or Judds boxes25 Rather it is that reflexivity is recursive in the sense discussed in chapter 1 it uses its from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies own outputs as inputs as Luhmann defines it26 It is only on the basis of that recursivitya dynamic process that takes timethat reflexivity becomes productive and not an endlessly repeating proverbial hall of mirrors associated with the most clichéd aspects of postmodernity I will explore in greater detail in chapters 8 and 9 the dynamics of recursivity and how they are related to the questions of meaning and form for other kinds of art poetry architecture but for now I want to note that for our current purposes there are two points here one logi cal and one biological As for the first Wieczorek captures something of how Kacs work thematizes the central facta logical and cognitive factabout recursive selfreference as Luhmann has theorized it namely that observation precisely because it is contingent and selfreferential will always maintain the world as severed by distinctions frames and forms and this partiality precludes any possibility of representation of mimesis and any holistic theory Thus Luhmann writes the world is observable because it is unobservable27a point whose larger resonance and thematics I will explore in chapters 8 and 10 Of more immediate relevance for Kacs work however is the sec ond point the biological one that recursive selfreference is crucial to how different kinds of autopoietic beings establish their difference from everything else in the world which is to say their specific ways of being in the worlda being that is now thoroughly subordinated to an autopoietic becoming For Kacand here is where Wieczorek is right that it is not simply a matter of new forms of visualitythis calls for the kind of recalibration redistribution and displacement of the relation ship between meaning and the entire sensorium of living beings that I discussed in the previous chapter in which visuality itselfas the human sensory apparatus par excellenceis now thoroughly decen tered and subjected to a rather different kind of logic a point I return to in some detail in chapter 7 To put it another way Kac subverts the centrality of the human and of anthropocentric modes of knowing and experiencing the world by displacing the centrality of its metonymic standin human and humanist visuality He does this in several different ways some of which are comparatively straightforward such as Darker than Night 1999 and Rara Avis 1996 In the former the viewer is linked in a com municational loop to roughly three hundred fruit bats via a batbot from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies implanted in their cave which enables the viewer to hear the con verted echolocation sonar signals of the living bats while the viewer wears a VR headset that converts the batbots sonar emissions into an abstract visual display28 In Rara Avis viewers don a headset linked to a camera in the head of a large robotic bird in an enclosure surrounded by living birds which enables the viewer to look out from the robotic birds point of view In both works sounds Rara Avis and sonar sig nals Darker than Night originating from human participants are re introduced into the animals environment allowing them to experi ence the presence of an absent human other 16266 More interesting still is how Kacs work also exploits what we might call our lust for the visual and its humanist centrality by trad ing on it repeatedly the glowinthedark creatures the outré coloring of the bird in Rara Avis or even the playful visual pun on the human eyeball in Teleporting an Unknown State 1996 to name a few This is not just as one critic puts it a matter of the scopic reversal that is a re curring theme in Kacs work particularly the works on telepresence nor is it just about a dialogical interchange that serves to multiply Eduardo Kac Teleporting an Unknown State telepresence work 199496 httpsprockettelabarticeduekac from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies the points of view available as in The Eighth Day Nor is it exactly that to the extent that something livingparticularly a mammalglows green we have an index of alterity an interpretation resisted by Kac by the way29 In fact I would argue that the use of GFP in Kacs work particu larly with the rabbit Alba in GFP Bunny operates as a kind of feint or lure that trades on the very humanist centrality of vision that Kacs work ends up subverting and in this it has more than a little in com mon with Diller  Scofidios cagey relationship to spectacle in their Blur project as well see in chapter 8 On display here in other words are the humanist ways in which we produce and mark the other in cluding the animal other our carnophallogocentric visual appetite displayed here in the form of spectacle which is fed in this instance by GFP From this vantage the point is perhaps not so much as W J T Mitchell puts it in his widely read essay The Work of Art in the Age of Biocybernetic Reproduction that Kacs work dramatizes the dif ficulty biocybernetic art has in making its object or model visible be cause the object of mimesis here is really the invisibility of the genetic revolution its inaccessibility to representation30 Rather it is that Kacs workwith its glowinthedark creatures and its black lights drawn as much from the storehouse of cheesy mass culture as anywhere makes all of this all too visible by eliciting and manipulating familiar forms and conventions of contemporary visual appetite In doing so it may be understood against the backdrop of Mitchells larger point about the work of art in an age of biocybernetic reproduction that the curious twist of our moment is that the digital is declared to be triumphant at the very same moment that a frenzy of the image and spectacle is announced 315 It is a question then of what we might call the place of the visualbut eventually for that very reason of everything else too as we will see in the next chapter And this involves in Kacs work a cir cular and indeed recursive procedure where the artist uses or other wise appeals to specifically human visual habits and conventions for the purposes of making the point that the visual as we traditionally think of it can precisely no longer be indexed to those conventions and habits at all In this light one way to underscore the difference be tween productive recursivity in Kacs work and a mere hallofmirrors from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies reflexivity is to say that the whole point of the glowinthedark rabbit of GFP Bunny and how it seizes on certain spectacularizing modes of human visuality is that the harder you look the less you see Albas meaning if we want to put it that way is not to be found in the brute fact of the glow of her coat in fact one might well say the meaning of the work is everywhere but there31 From this vantage we might well think of the strategy Kac de ploys in the work Time Capsule 1997 as framed by this same logic In that piece Kac was televised and simultaneously webcast injecting into his leg a microchip with a unique identification number that reveals it self when scanneda device commonly used for registering and recov ering companion animals As part of the work Kac registered himself in an Identichip database as both animal and owner In addition the work included seven sepiatoned photographs of members of Kacs family from previous generations and a telerobotic Web scanning and xray display of the implant in Kacs leg Here again Kacs deployment of spectacle and the visual generally makes the point I think that the significance of the work is everywhere except in its elementsvehicles reallyof visuality and spectacle It begins to dawn on us just how true this is when we understand as Edward LucieSmith points out that Kac is of Jewish origin that a number of his family members some of them pictured in the photographs were Polish Jews who died in the Nazi Holocaust and how the microchip incorporating a number al ludes to the numbers tattooed on the arms of those who were herded into concentration campsbut here of course the identifying num bers cannot be read 22 Herded is indeed a word to be insisted on here as this piece also focuses our attention not on livestock animals but the domestic animalsmainly cats and dogsfor whom the chip is designed animals that a vast majority of owners describe as family members Are they less animals than those other living beings we call meat Than the Jews in the eyes of the Nazis who forced them into cattle cars at gunpoint Moreover this welter of complicated as sociations and category crossings can be amplified one last time when we remind ourselves of the questions addressed in chapter 3 around Derridas characterization of contemporary forms of animal exploita tion in biomedical research and factory farming as a holocaust a characterization shared by Coetzees Elizabeth Costello from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies All of this completely changes the understanding of theatrical ity as criticized by Fried The point is not just as Fried would have it that Kacs work is theater which in his terms it would surely be but that theater is not doing the work Fried thinks it does In Kac the artwork does indeed play up to the viewer but only as Derrida would put it to lead the viewer to the realization that the only place the meaning of the work may be found is no place not where the viewer irresistibly looks eg at the spectacle of the glowinthedark crea tures but rather as we saw in chapter 5 precisely where the viewer does not seenot refuses to look or even is prevented from see ing but rather cannot see If we keep in mind that theatricality de pends first and foremost on spatial distribution we can appreciate the resonance of Derridas comment invoked in my earlier discussions for Kacs attemptand the ethics of that attemptto situate the visual in ways that fundamentally trouble how we have typically indexed the human animal sensorium to the humananimal ontological divide that space isnt only the visible and moreover the invisiblean in visible that is itself not simply the opposite of vision32 In this light we can see more clearlyor perhaps I should say more obliquely how Kacs theatricalization of visuality doesnt evade the viewers fini tude and humanness as Fried would have it but rather underscores it in the specifically posthumanist sense that the field of meaning and experience is no longer thought to be exhausted by the selfreference of a particularly even acutely human visuality33 In the end then the contrast between Sue Coe and Eduardo Kac helps us to see in the realm of art the difference between two differ ent kinds of posthumanism that correspond to the distinction drawn at the end of chapter 4 a humanist posthumanism and a posthumanist one Coe may be viewed as a posthumanist in the obvious and thematic sense that she takes seriously the ethical and even political challenges of the existence of nonhuman animals this latter in her crossmapping of the exploitation of animals and of workers in factory farming within a Marxist frame But as I demonstrated in some detail in chapters 3 and 4 and Ill return to the question late in the next chapter you can well be committed to this posthumanist question in a humanist way that is to say in a way that reinstalls a familiar figure of the human at the center of the universe of experience in animal rights philosophy from dead meat to glowinthedar k bunnies or representation in Coes work And it is such a subject who then on the basis of that sovereignty extends ethical or artistic consideration outward toward the nonhuman other In this light Coes work is hu manist in a crucial sense indeed in the only sense that turns out to be fundamental to her work as art it relies on a subject from whom nothing in principle is hidden A subject who if blind is blind not consti tutively as I think Kacs work dramatizes in multiple ways but only because heand I would insist on the male pronoun in this instance for reasons that Derridas analysis of carnophallogocentrism makes clearhas not yet seen what Coes art is calculated to reveal so pow erfully indeed melodramatically This complicates considerablyone might even say fatefullyCoes conception of art as a form of wit nessing34 For what must be witnessed is not just what we can see but also what we cannot seeindeed that we cannot see That too must be witnessed But by whom if not by the other This page intentionally left blank When You Cant Believe Your Eyes or Voice Dancer in the Dark Given the critique of the humanist schema of visuality I have been developing over the past two chapters we are now in a better position to appreciate a cognate assertion with which I want to begin here sound is not voice The desire for it to be so seems to lie at the heart of much compelling art music and film How we feel about this desirethat to be human at all is to thoroughly take that desire for granted or conversely that to live in postEnlightenment much less posthumanist culture is to see that desire as romantic in the worst possible senseis a question visited on audiences with uncanny and disconcerting force in Lars von Triers film Dancer in the Dark When the film was first released in May 2000 it provoked violently divergent responses from its audiences even as it won the Palme dOr at the Cannes Film Festival the audience as one reviewer reported erupted with an indecipherable storm of cheers and catcalls1 Some viewers walked out of the theater visibly shaken and in tears while others just walked outhalfway through the film This nearly unprecedented po larization carried through to the reviews which ranged from the awe struck to the dismissive and merely nasty Some praised the film lav ishly Youve never seen anything like Dancer in the Dark one wrote another called it a work of thrilling originality2 At the other end of the spectrum a reviewer for the Nation complained that the film was about seeing how much of the preposterous he von Trier can get you to swallow without gagging more pointedly still another labeled it a genuinely infantile work an ugly selfindulgent folly3 Even reviewers who supported the film felt the need to disavow it while admitting that the power of Dancer in the Dark is undeniable David Ansen in Newsweek called it a magnificent sham riddled with emo tional sadism4 What is going here when you cant believ e your eyes or voice To begin to answer that question we need to get a fix on how to approach this weird and iconoclastic film what sorts of generic expectations we may bring to it That however is only the point of entry into the much more complicated question I will take up later the question of what we might call the films ethical project and how it might well be the source of its audiences and reviewers hysterical reactions a term whose appropriateness will become clear I hope in due course To take up the question of genre first we have to under stand that for Dancer in the Dark any hint of reality character in the usual sense verisimilitude and the like are for the purposes at hand the merestand I do mean the merestvehicles for the films deeper concerns Here it will suffice to simply register the shameless melodrama of the plot the incredibly innocent Selma played by the pop phenom Björk in what nearly everyone agrees is a stunning per formance who is slowly going blind sacrifices her own life so that her tenyearold son Gene Vladica Kostic may receive an operation that will save his sight from the ravages of the same congenital disease Dancer in the Dark in other words is no more satisfactory fulfilling or compelling in terms of plausibility and Aristotelian necessity than say The Marriage of Figaroand that is precisely the point In fact the films power is in a profound sense inseparable from what many view ers will see as its absurdity if one wants to put it that way precisely in the way that the absurdity of opera its melodrama its hyperbole its staginessall those qualities that make people either love or hate opera too is in fact absolutely central to operas philosophical and ethical project To put it as bluntly as possible Dancer in the Dark like opera isnt about reality it is about what reality turns away from and the aversion to borrow an Emersonian term I will excavate later on of opera to that turning away In that it is again like opera more real than realitybut more about that in a moment On the question of genre it needs to be said that although Dancer in the Dark invites us to make it legible within the genre of the Hollywood musical this is ultimately a blind alley The film is not a musical at least not in that sense While the musical insists on as a constitutive feature the seamless continuity of the world inside and outside the musical numbers themselvescharacters engaged in real istic dialogue among passersby who realistically pay no attention to when you cant believ e your eyes or voice them suddenly break into song and the passersby suddenly join in Dancer takes great pains to insist on the radical split between the world of Selmas fantasy in which the musical sequences take place and the world that the film itself in broader terms constructs and inhabits Still the film certainly does situate itself in relation to the Hollywood musical its conventions and what they signify And in this light Dancer might be viewed as an intensification of the stakes of the Hollywood musi cal taking it more seriously than the musical itself ever did which may be in part what so irritates those who despise this film and at the same time as a deconstruction of the musicals way of imagining those stakesa posture that the film achieves by insisting on the clear distinction between the world of the main character Selma and its own In these terms Dancer in the Dark would force the question as it were Would Gene Kelly be willing to die to dance with his umbrella in Singin in the Rain Fred Astaire put a gun to his head for the sake of dancing with his mop It is as if the problem were not that the musical as a genre is so preposterous that no one can sit still for it anymore but that it isnt preposterous enoughwhich is to say that it no longer pur sues with enough seriousness and extremity enough abandonment its own claims and project To do soto be that preposterous and that serious at the same timeis to move by way of thumbnail definition from the realm of the musical to the realm of opera and to realize that on the most basic level those claims have to do as Stanley Cavell has suggested with life and death and with sound and vision as modalities for experiencing the world and the loss of the worldall of which are related to the question of film as a medium and how this film relates to the limits of that medium From this vantage we would do better to think of Dancer in the Dark as a kind of postmodern opera rather than a musical Here Cavells work on these questionsspanning by now several books from the early study The World Viewed Reflections on the Ontology of Film through two books on Hollywood genre films to the collections Themes Out of School and the more recent A Pitch of Philosophycan be of some help For Cavell the philosophical and ethical significances of film and of voice in opera are structured by the larger problematic that occupies the whole of his work namely the problem of philosophi cal skepticism I have already touched on the point in chapter 3 and when you cant believ e your eyes or voice I will revisit it in much more detail on the terrain of Cavells reading of Emerson in chapter 9 After Descartes and Kant skepticism names not just an epistemological problem but a more profound and deeply ethical loss of the world that is coterminous with Enlightenment modernity itself in which the modern condition is to be homeless in the world permanently doomed to haunt it rather than inhabit it as Cavell sometimes puts it For Cavell the significance of film and of operatic voice is located at what he calls the crossing of the lines of skepticism and romanticismthat is to say the juncture at which our desire for contact with the world of things and of others our need to believe that what we know experience and love is of the world is crossed by our knowledge that we are profoundly and permanently isolated locked as Emerson puts it in a prison of glass The most famous version of the settlement with skepticism Cavell argues is probably Kants in The Critique of Pure Reason which argues 1 Experience is constituted by appearances 2 Appearances are of something else which accordingly cannot itself appear 3 All and only functions of experience can be known these are our categories of the understanding 4 It follows that the something elsethat of which appearances are appearances whose existence we must grantcannot be known the famous Ding an sich or thing in itself In discovering this limitation of reason reason proves its power to itself over itself 5 Moreover since it is unavoidable for our reason to be drawn to think about this unknowable ground of appearance reason reveals itself to itself in this necessity also5 The dissatisfaction with Kants settlement with skepticism is readily imaginable of course but what is less clearand even more important to Cavellis the companion satisfaction that is expressed in Kants portrait of the human being as living in two worlds in one of them determined in the other free    One romantic use for this idea of two worlds lies in its accounting for the human beings dissatisfaction with as it were itself    as if the one stance produced the wish for the other as if the best proof of human existence were its power to yearn as if for its better or other existence Another romantic use for this idea of our two worlds is its    insight that the human being now lives in neither world that we are as is said between worldsa condition Cavell characterizes as the endemic worldlessness or homelessness when you cant believ e your eyes or voice that is of a piece with the modern condition6 Philosophical skepticism after the Kantian turn in other words names for Cavell a radical form of posthumanism one that Kants transcendental turn cf items 4 and 5 in the list just cited attempts to recontain and romanticismas well see in different permutations in the next three chaptersnames the persistence of the humanist desire for holism unity and coher ence in the face of that knowledge All of which makes postskeptical posthumanist philosophyin a phrase that has obvious resonance not only for the character of Selma in Dancer in the Dark but also for the adjacent autism of Temple Grandina philosophy of immigrancy of the human as a stranger7 In this light Selmas encroaching blindness in the film might be read as a figure for the inevitability of the general human condition of being in the dark wandering in a world of shad ows and specters never at home but merely sometimes at rest Along the same lines the philosophical import of voice in opera then is that it communicates that we may leap as it were from a judgment of the world as unreal or alien to an encompassing sense of another realm flush with this one into which there is no good reason we do not or cannot step unless opera works out the reasons Such a view Cavell continues will take singing I guess above all the aria to express the sense of being pressed or stretched between worldsone in which to be seen the roughly familiar world of the philosophers and one from which to be heard a world to which one releases or abandons ones spirit a world that recedes when the breath of the song ends 144 The resonance of this formulation for the character of Selma is clear enough and it is only sharpened by Cavells sugges tion that Kants vision of the human being as living in two worlds corresponds roughly to two general matching interpretations of the expressive capacity of song ecstasy over the absolute success of its expressiveness in recalling the world as if bringing it back to life melancholia over its inability to sustain the world which may be put as an expression of the absolute inexpressiveness of the voice of its failure to make itself heard to become intelligible 141 This last abandoning ones spirit to and giving voice to a world that no one will hearis evidently a mad state Cavell adds and it is one that seems to be reserved for the women of opera 140 and in the case at hand of course reserved for Selma Cavell is here responding to Catherine when you cant believ e your eyes or voice Cléments assertion in Opera or The Undoing of Women that opera is about the death of womenthat is to say it is about the countless forms in which men want and want not to hear the womans voice    to know and not know what she knows about mens desires8a claim that Cavell will modulate into the rather different and shall we say more strictly philosophical assertion that a womans singing exposes her as thinking so exposes her to the power of those who do not want her to think 146 in which case she becomes for Cavell a figure for that philosophical selftorment whose shape is skepticism in which the philosopher wants and wants not to exempt himself from the closet of privacy wants and want not to become intelligible expressive ex posed 132 The stakes of this revisionist relationship to Cléments thesis are perhaps apparent enough for a film that ends with Selmas death by hanging Does she die because she is a woman Because she thinks Because she sings from a world that imagines the two might coincide But the stakes of that revision are complicated by Cavells surprising suggestion that the mad state reserved for women in opera usually takes place only after their words can treat some difficulty internal to their marrying as if skepticism is narratively figured as an assault on marriage 14041 What we find in the womans operatic voice is exposure to a world of the separation of the self from itself in which the splitting of the self into speech is expressed as the separation from someone who represents to that self the continuance of the world    in whom ones expectation of intelligibility has been placed and col lapses 151 Moreover this thematization is redoubled in Hollywood film in the theme of remarriage Cavell has written a whole book about it Pursuits of Happiness The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage which suggests that the validity of the bond of marriage is assured    by something I call the willingness for remarriage as a way of continu ing to affirm the happiness of ones initial leap As if the chance of happinessthe chance of continuing to sing and dance to hope in the face of skepticismexists only when it seconds itself9 What is pertinent about this aspect of Cavells thesis is that in Dancer in the Dark what cannot be missed is the matter of Selmas conspicuously absent husband and her equally conspicuous rebuffing of her suitor Jeff played by Peter Stormare And while she permits when you cant believ e your eyes or voice a certain amount of conversational intimacy with her neighbor and landlord Bill David Morse they talk late into the night about going to musicals when they were kids and so on we are to understand that this is possible only because Bill is marriedas if in Cavells terms Selmas ability to continue to believe in the world that is rapidly reced ing from sight resides not in the possibility of her remarriage hence her repeated rejections of Jeffs overtures in the films most important musical number Ive Seen It All but in her handing down the gift of continued sight to her son The only way of ensuring the contin ued existence of the world is not marriage and what it signifies but the rejection of marriage in an act of sacrifice that might be characterized as radically feminine in its rejection of a nuclear heteronormativity that at the least lurks in the background of Cavells speculations on remarriage The relationship of the two worlds of vision associated with epistemology and sense certainty on the one hand and of voice asso ciated with the loss of the world under skepticism and the hope of its recovery on the other is complicated even more by Cavells contention that the ethical and philosophical project of opera was at a certain point taken over by filma contention he bases on analogizing the cameras powers of transfiguration to those of music each providing settings of words and persons that unpredictably take them into a new medium with laws of its own10 Just what those settings are may be clarified by Cavells adaptation of Heideggers famous thesis on the broken tool Film for Cavell is a phenomenon in which a particular mode of sight or awareness is brought into play by a disruption of what Heidegger calls the workworld a disruption of the matters of course running among our tools and the occupations they extend It is upon the dis ruption of such matters of course of a tool say by its breaking that we find to use Heideggers phrase the worldhood of the world an nouncing itself in all its conspicuousness and obstinacy its thereness11 We have here to do he continues with something about the human capacity for sightand here the link with the problem of skepticism becomes clearor for sensuous awareness generally something we might express as our condemnation to project to inhabit a world that goes essentially beyond the delivery of our senses In this light one may read Buster Keaton in The General for instance to exemplify an when you cant believ e your eyes or voice acceptance of the enormity of this realization of human limitation de nying neither the abyss that at any time may open before our plans nor the possibility despite that open possibility of living honorably 175 Or more to the point for our purposes the same might be said of Fred Astaires dancing which far from being escapist as is usu ally charged with the Hollywood musical is meant as a removal not from life but from death as facing the music as a response to the life of inexorable consequences 23a reading that would seem to apply quite poignantly to Selmas musical fantasies in the face of blindness and eventually of death itself Keatons comedy Astaires dancing and Selmas musicals then all face the music of skepticism in the same way that the aria does in opera but the difference is that film democratizes the knowledge hence at once blesses and curses us with it by telling us that it is as available to all as the ability is to hold a camera on a subject so that a failure so to perceive to persist in missing the subject is ascribable only to ourselves Thus the philosophical and ethical problem of inhabiting a world that goes essentially beyond the delivery of our senses is only intensified in film by virtue of its very medium Our sense of films specific relation to this problem can be sharpened if we attend to Cavells distinction between painting and photography and film for him as a mode of photography After the advent of photog raphy what painting wanted he suggests was a sense of presentness not exactly a conviction of the worlds presence to us but of our pres ence to it At some point the unhinging of our consciousness from the world as in the fall into skepticism after Kant interposed our subjectivity between us and our presentness to the world Then our subjectivity became what is present to us individuality became isola tion The route to conviction in reality was through the acknowledg ment of that endless presence of self12 In a passage worth comparing with my discussion in chapter 3 of the spectrality of visual media as Derrida describes it Cavell asserts that photography on the other hand and with it film overcame subjectivity in a way undreamed of by painting a way that could not satisfy painting one which does not so much deflect the act of painting as escape it altogether by automatism by removing the human agent from the task of reproduction    To maintain conviction in our connection with reality to maintain our when you cant believ e your eyes or voice presentness painting accepts the recession of the world Photography maintains the presentness of the world by accepting our absence from it The reality in a photograph is present to me while I am not present to it13 We are to use Derridas words spectralized by the shot So it is that film for Cavell has a kind of magical ability to meet the threat of skepticism not by literally presenting us with the world but by permitting us to view it unseen as though the worlds projec tion explains our forms of unknownness and of our inability to know 40 There is an important reversal here in fact two reversals If music and voice as we find them in opera met the loss of the world under skepticism by an assertion that we nevertheless miraculously existin this sense music and song come to the rescue of language after skep ticism as Cavell sometimes puts itthey did so only at the price of acknowledging that the world of things was always already lost Gone In photography and film on the other hand the existence of the world is miraculously affirmed via automatism but the price we pay for the worlds recovery is that it no longer exists for us It is radically ahuman other We cant know or touch the world precisely because it manifests itself unbidden without our help Film is thus what the world looks like when were not there What is most interesting hereespecially for the purpose of dis cussing a film such as Dancer in the Dark in which the relationship be tween the visual the auditory and the vocal is so pressingis Cavells insistence that while we dont know how to think of the connection between a photograph and what it is a photograph of The image is not a likeness he rightly insists one might wonder that similar questions do not arise about recordings of sound14 Is the difference between auditory and visual transcription he asks a function of the fact that we are fully accustomed to hearing things that are invisible not present to us not present with us We would be in trouble if we werent so accustomed because it is the nature of hearing that what is heard comes from someplace whereas what you can see you can look at    We are not accustomed to seeing things that are invisible or not present to us not present with us    Yet this seems ontologically to be what is happening when we look at a photograph 18 The idea here is that with the visual the lines of determination run from the intentional subject to the object to what we look at and hence the when you cant believ e your eyes or voice world manifest is suddenly removed from the equation With sound on the other hand the lines run from the object where sound comes from to the subjectit is as Derrida might put it a spatialization of the subjectobject relationso that a corollary magic would involve our insertion into the equation as if we had to actively listen just as we actively direct sight to hear anything at all What I want to suggest is that something like this reversal is ex actly what happens in Dancer in the Dark with profound implications for how the film stages the relationship between the auditory and the visual and within that the relationship of both of these to the project of film as a medium There are two dynamics at work here and it is cru cial to disarticulate them on the one hand Selmas drama and its philo sophical and ethical significance and on the other what the film from a quite different vantage does with that drama It is here on the strength of this disarticulation that we can begin to sense some of the limits of Cavells workthe extent to which it is we might say Selmacentric Let us return briefly to Cavells account of visual versus auditory tran scription in The World Viewed specifically his contention when I am in the presence of an English horn playing I still dont literally hear the horn I hear the sound of the horn So I dont worry about hearing a horn when the horn is not present because what I hear is exactly the same    whether the thing is present or not What this rigmarole calls attention to is that sounds can be perfectly copied and that we have various interests in copying them 368 It is as if recorded sound has taken the place of Roland Barthess photograph and its umbilical cord to the real critiqued by Derrida in chapter 3 In this light Cavells dis cussion of visual versus auditory transcription would appear to take its place as part of that film theory that has assured us as Kaja Silverman puts it that there is no difference between recorded and prerecorded soundsthat the apparatus is miraculously capable of capturing and retransmitting the profilmic event in all its auditory plenitude so that with each new testimonial to the authenticity of recorded sound cin ema seems once again capable of restoring all phenomenal losses15 As Silverman points out however it is relatively easy to demonstrate that every acoustic event is inseparable from the space in which it occurs and that in sound recording as in image recording the technological when you cant believ e your eyes or voice apparatus in question is always highly selective isolating and intensify ing some features and ignoring others Indeed as Douglas Kahn has exhaustively shown in his study Noise Water Meat A History of Sound in the Arts the kinds of qualifications and nuances voiced by Silverman are precisely those that have captivated the huge body of work in sound art in the twentieth century much of which foregrounds the techno logical mediation and environmental embeddedness of sound as a me dium think for instance of John Cage or Alvin Lucier to name only two wellknown examples16 From this vantage Cavells remarks on auditory versus visual transcription seem to reintroduce the very kind of phenomenological plenitude that film automatically delivers in Cavells account but without the attendant and crucial clarification that such plenitude is the product of fantasy only To linger over this moment in Cavells work is to realize that there is a crucial and altogether symptomatic aporiain fact a double aporiaat the heart of his understanding of voice in relation to sound As for the first remember that for Cavell sound and voice are in the deepest sense not continuous but opposed voice aligned with the sub ject it takes over the function of the Word after language has been subjected to the withering force of skepticism and sound with the object as that which comes from the world to the subject as it were unbidden But it is difficult to see how the difference between sound and voice can be maintained as a constitutive ontological difference how the interiority of voice as expression can be quarantined from the exteriority that is its material medium and condition of possibility in sound To put it as concisely as possible voice and sound exist along a continuum not a divide which is simply to say in another register that one persons voice is another persons noisea point hardly laid to rest by appeals to the generic norms of opera or any other art form More important than this however is the second aporia interior to voice itself As Cavell explains it film reverses the ascension in the ater of character over actor in theater the emphasis is that this char acter could will accept other actors which thus figures the fated ness in human existence the selfs finality or typicality In film the actor not the role is predominant and this is a vehicle for films demo cratic emphasis on the potentiality in human existence the selfs journeying In opera however the relation of actorsinger and role when you cant believ e your eyes or voice is unimportant beside the fact of the new conception it introduces of the relation of voice and body in which this voice is located inone might say disembodied withinthis figure this double this person this persona this singer whose voice is essentially unaffected by the role17 What makes Cavells account here fascinating is its radical am bivalence about the voice as disembodied withinbut within what Here the Cavellian voice would seem legible as a variety of what Slavoj Žižek calls the Cartesian subject in all its abstraction the empty punc tuality we reach after subtracting all its particular contents what we might call the principle of voice is thus disembodied within a sub ject whose contingent features are unimportant a subject that is in Cavells words this figure this double this person this personain short this etcetera18 What this suggests I think is that voice in Cavell is a figure for presence but a presence that as in Descartes and Kant should not be confused with substance and is in fact based on the tran scendence of substance as pathological contingency and materiality to use Kants term More precisely then the apparent opposition of sound and voice in Cavellthe first aporia I touched onis subtended by a more fundamental commitment to a presence that links them presence of the world to itself captured in the automatism of the pho tograph and sound recording and presence of the voice to itself that testifies to the worlds loss or passing under skepticismthat knows it and in voicing that knowledge sings humanisms last aria It is here that the Lacanian schema of the subject I have already invoked by way of Žižek and Silverman with its interweaving of the two sides of voice and sound Symbolic and Real and so on may be of help Silverman for example in her pathbreaking study The Acoustic Mirror insists following Lacan that meaning and materiality subject and object are always coimplicated and interwoven in a symbolic and psychic economy of imbalance constituted by a lack at the center of the subject who can be subject only insofar as he has acceded to the dic tates of a Symbolic order not his own in what she characterizes as a preOedipal castration of a subject who is structured by lack long before the discovery of sexual difference a subject whose very coher ence and certitude are predicated on division and alienation19 This diacritical interweaving rather than Cavellian opposition of presence and absence has for her particular and direct implications for reading when you cant believ e your eyes or voice the engendering and embodying of voice in film Classical cinema Silverman writes requires the female voice to assume similar respon sibilities to those it confers upon the female body where it operates as a fetish filling in for and covering over what is unspeakable within male subjectivity In her vocal as in her corporeal capacity womanas fetish may be asked to represent that phenomenal plenitude which is lost to the male subject with his entry into language though she is more frequently obliged to display than to conceal lackto protect the male subject from knowledge of his own castration by absorbing his losses as well as those that structure female subjectivity 3839 Here we cant help but recall Cavells contention that opera is about the countless forms in which men want and want not to hear the womans voice    to know and not know what she knows about mens desires20 But it is crucial to remember that in Cavells account the idea that womens singing exposes them to death is rewritten specifically in terms as exposes her as thinking so exposes her to the power of those who do not want her to think 146in which case she becomes for Cavell a figure for that philosophical selftorment whose shape is skepticism in which the philosopher wants and wants not to exempt himself from the closet of privacy wants and want not to become intelligible expressive exposed 132 In making this turn however Cavell would seem to take away with one hand what he has given with the other and that is the specificity and materiality of womans embodiment in relation to voicean embodiment that a posthumanist reading would surely insist on A similar double gesture is at work in Cavells use of Freuds distinction between orality and vo cality in Freuds essay Negation to account for the at once primi tive or bodily and sophisticated or performative power of the voice Cavell wants to capture the interlacing of the spectacular vocality of opera in its aspect as orality and in its aspect as exposure or display sometimes named seductiveness 145 For Cavell the power of voice in opera as a judgment of the world on the basis of called forth by pain beyond a concept is itself rooted in the oral primi tive basis of judgment as explained in Freuds theory in Negation where introjection and expulsion from the body are the origins of af firmative or negative judgments As a result for Cavell the very draw ing and expelling of the breath in singing enacts a kind of urdialectic when you cant believ e your eyes or voice between bringing the world nearer overcoming skepticism and then pushing it away in a transcendence that is also a mourning 148 Here one would simply want to point out by way of Lacan and his inheritors such as Silverman and Žižek that the drives including orality are always already denaturalized because they are accessible only retroactively by means of the Symbolic itself From this vantage the fundamental issue with the voices power is not whether it can be tethered via the body orality to the world of the Cavellian ordi nary and everyday thereby ensuring us that the pain of the operatic voice remains real and not as it were merely epistemological Rather the body itself is already denaturalized and derailed to use Žižeks term by the Symbolic order so that the primitive basis of voice the drive rather than coming first as in Cavell is instead a retroactively determined and excessive product of the Symbolic of desire in a psychic economy characterized above all by imbalance It thus never was in our power you might say to lose the world in the way Cavell imagines or to lose that loss by means of the voice and its introjection or expulsion All of which is to say that the suggestive correspondence between the Lacanian theory of the split subject of desire and Cavells reading of singing as disembodied within the doubleness of the human and the splitting of the self into speech is and will remain only thatsuggestive21 Meanwhileto clarify the stakes of some of this for the film itselfit is obvious enough that Selma is doubly marked by figures of castration indeed by the most canonical such figures there are in her encroaching blindness and in her death by hanging But the question turning now from Cavells terms to those of psychoanalysisis the na ture of this castration what it is supposed to signify Is this as Silverman might suggest about killing off the feminine and maternal body in the service of phallic disavowal of preOedipal castration in which Selma is sacrificed for those losses she is made to bear Or is something else going on here In fact what is most important about Selmas castration is not that it robs her of agency butquite the reversethat it makes her the films maximum example of agency Moreover the force of her agency would seem to increase in direct proportion to her growing loss of vision the increasingly melodramatic absurdity of her situa tion and how she responds to its mounting crisis This is made clear in when you cant believ e your eyes or voice any number of ways not least in her steadfast refusal of the otherwise advantageous romantic overtures by Jeff her assertion in the films most powerful musical number that Ive seen all I need to see even as he suggests that if she marries him and then sees Niagara falls has grandchildren and so on the world will be in Cavellian terms re stored to her in and through marriage Crucial here too is the motif of Selmas absent husbanda point to which I will return in a moment We can clarify the status of castration in relation to the feminine and the Symbolic in the film most readily by recourse to Silvermans fascinating discussion of how in Hollywood castration is not the only trope through which dominant cinema conflates the female voice with the female body 63 Here she takes issue quite pointedly with Michel Chions formulation in La voix au cinéma that in much the same way that the feminine sex is the ultimate point in the deshabille the point after which it is no longer possible to deny the absence of the penis there is an ultimate point in the embodiment of the voice and that is the mouth from which the voice issues22 In Silvermans estimation Chion here simply reproduces on theoretical terrain Hollywoods con flation of the female voice with the female body and so organizes female sexuality around the image of    the insatiable organ hole that may be figured as either mouth or vagina 63 With this turn the interiority which Hollywood imputes to her has nothing whatever to do with transcendence or Cartesian cogitation On the contrary that interiority helps to establish the female body as the absolute limit of female subjectivity    Womans psyche is only a further extension of her bodyits other side or to be more precise its inside 64 What this means for Silverman however is that the yawning chasm of a corporeal interiority that is posited as a major port of entry into her subjectivity is better viewed as the site at which that subjectivity is introduced into her with the voice the preferred point of insertion 67 In short the female voice and with it the mouth from which it is sues are the point of entry for the phallus the Law and the Symbolic into female subjectivity if classical cinema has its way Here however valuable as it is for exposing some of the prob lems with Cavells work on voice opera and film we glimpse some thing like the limit of Silvermans thesis for understanding Dancer in the Darkor perhaps we should say that we begin to understand how when you cant believ e your eyes or voice Silverman What is most unmistakable in Selmas drama of course and it is crucial to the posthumanist ethical project of the film and how that project is linked to its embodimentis the unmasking of the Law as a senseless contingent machine constructed utterly by factitious selfinstantiation The film makes this clear in any number of ways from the adjacent drama of Bill her landlord policeman who betrays Selma and steals her money to pay off bills run up by his freespending wife to the almost sadomasochistic courtroom drama and the facile construction of Selma as a murderer to the fact that justice and death by hanging for Selma are determined in the end not by justice but by money In light of all of this we might give a rather different interpretation than Silvermans to the altogether unavoidable matter of Björks performative relationship to the mouth and tongue as site of the female voice at key moments in the musical numbers her tongue swells into a kind of fleshy protuberance a wall blocking entry into the interiority of the female subject as the voice soars and asserts its power Here the performative use of the mouth and tongue uncannily expresses not the entry of the Symbolic and the phallic Law into the feminine subject via the organ hole of the mouth and voicenot the site at which that subjectivity is introduced into herbut rather I would argue its rejection and blockage which coincides with the raising of the womans voice itself to its highest registers23 I would like to take this striking performative punctuation of the film by Björk as an index of the fact that there is another more profound sense of the feminine at work in Dancer in the Darka sense that perhaps accounts for the wild ambivalence and hysteria that greeted the film upon its release Here Žižeks work on sacrifice suicide and the act as feminine will help us understand that there are two differ ent aspects of the feminine at work in the film The point of agree ment between Silverman and Žižek versus Cavells reading would no doubt be their insistence via Lacan that any relationship to the world of the object the Thing the body the drives and so on is always riven with difference and denaturalized that is to say the human is thus that fantasmatic object the auto that the autobiographical animal gives to itself to use Derridas phrasing that constitutes itself by repressing this more fundamental posthumanist symbolic economy when you cant believ e your eyes or voice They would disagree however on the ethical ramifications of this fact visàvis the question of the feminine Where Silverman would find in the phallic regime of Hollywood film the displacement of preOedipal losses onto the feminine body and voice Žižek would identify the phallic itself with such losses and would therefore locate the femi nine at the very core and as the very truth of the phallic This is so in Žižeks reading because the phallus in Lacan as the origin of desire is not natural not given as such but is instead a signifierwhich is to say that desire and the phallus that constitutes it are socially pro duced and culturally determined so that the Real of the socalled drives the biological the body and of course the feminine body in contrast to male cogito becomes accessible only by being retroactively posited as original and natural by the contingent and diacritical sys tem of the Symbolic itself As Žižek puts it the phallusassignifier thus operatesagainst the clichéd notion of the phallus as the siege of male natural penetrativeaggressive potencypoweras a kind of prosthetic artificial supplement it designates the point at which the big Other the Symbolic a decentered agency supplements the subjects failure its lack of coordination and unity24 The phallus that is to say rather than being the very mark and icon of humanism and its law is properly understood always already posthumanist and in that sense feminine Žižek explores this theme in any number of registers including romanticisms commonplace of madness as the positive foundation Björk in Dancer in the Dark 2000 directed by Lars von Trier when you cant believ e your eyes or voice of normality which clearly announces the Freudian thesis that the pathological provides the key to the normal Given my discussion in chapter 5 most interesting for our purposes perhaps is his example of the Enlightenment idea that blindness itself provides the key to under standing the logic of vision in the same way that in Malebranche the pathological case of feeling a hand one does not have in fact provides the key to explaining how a normal person feels the hand he actually possesses In strict analogy to Lacans claim that a madman is not only a beggar who thinks he is a king but also a king who thinks he is a kingbecause he directly grounds his symbolic mandate in his immediate natural propertiesMalebranche claims that a madman is not only he who feels his missing hand without having one but also he who feels the hand he really has since when I claim to feel my hand directly I confound two ontologically different registers the material bodily hand and the representation of a hand in my mind which is the only thing I am actually aware of25 And this in turn is analogous to the status of the phallus itself as prosthetic since it too is referenced to the natural body and yet can only be experienced through mediation by the regime of the signifier and the Symbolic There is an important point of contact here as we know from earlier chapters between Žižeks account of the Lacanian phallus and the set of terms that cluster in Derridas work around the prosthesis the supplement and so ona point to which I will return in a moment For now however what needs to be registered for us to understand the status of the feminine in relation to the films ethical project is that the truth of the phallus is the truth that the subject is always already a prosthetic subject always in need of the supplement provided by pre cisely that which is castrating in the first place namely the Symbolic thus generatingin contrast to Cavellian skepticisma constitutively unbalanced psychic economy driven by what Žižek calls the loop of symbolic castration 135 The fundamental prosthetics of subjectiv ity are registered and thematized in all sorts of obvious ways in the film Most obvious of all is the conspicuous fact of Selmas failing eyesight and the various strategies used to supplement it the crib sheet she uses at her visit to the eye doctor for example which she memorizes so that she can pretend to read the eye chart and keep her job the Cokebottle eyeglasses that she shares with her son Gene like a prosthetic supple when you cant believ e your eyes or voice ment to the already natural and complete motherson bond which fall to the floor in a cut shot at the moment of her hanging as if to sug gest that only in death does one escape the prosthetics of subjectivity and the fact that the natural originary state of being sighted can be achieved for Gene only by means of surgical interventiona kind of literalization of the Freudian notion of retroactive causality Other ex amples abound Most fascinating of all perhaps is the scene in which Selma and Kathy attend the movies to watch a Hollywood musical Here however watching the film takes the following form Kathy tells Selma in a verbal blowbyblow what is going on on the screen that she cannot see only to have that linear account interrupted by a run ning argument that erupts with another patron a few rows up who is irritated by her talking For Selma watching the film consists of see ing nothing and hearing a sound track overwritten by a verbal account derailed by a shouting matchall of which it should be added she glee fully takes in as if its better than seeing the film normally This scene invokes the central prosthetic thematization of the filmhow with failing sight the realm of sound becomes more and more Selmas way to bring the world nearer to use the Emersonian phrase invoked by Cavella fact painfully evoked in Selmas jail cell on death row as she desperately presses her ear to the ventilation grate in the deafening silence trying to hold on to one last aural thread of the world around her At this precise juncture however it is crucial to insist on the difference between what the prosthetic relations of vi sion and sound mean to Selma and what they mean to the film the better to understand the ethical project that drives the films use of Selma as a character and a vehicle For what cannot be missed by any viewer I think is the striking even jarring difference between how the film is shot inside and outside Selmas fantasy musical scenes with the inside scenes in vivid color carefully in fact remarkably choreographed and edited with footage taken reportedly from one hundred digital cameras used to film each sequence and the outside scenes presented in washedout sepia tones in the best cinema verité documentary style Now the point here is not some untenable distinction between the cooked and the raw the artful and the authentic the medi ated and the umediated and so on but rather the films startling and when you cant believ e your eyes or voice principled insistence on this visual difference All of which we must re member is framed by a question of genre namely why the Hollywood musical as the generic mode of Selmas fantasies The most succinct answer I think is to say that for Selma the Hollywood musical uses music song and voice to prosthetically assume the functions of cog nitive mapping to use Fredric Jamesons wellworn phrase usually reserved in the humanistic tradition as we saw in chapter 5 for the visual in which the world presents itself in evidence as it were before the gaze of the centered subject around which the world of tables and chairs or in Gene Kellys case umbrellas coalesces In psycho analytic terms in the Hollywood musical it is as if the fantasy structure of normal vision itself is laid bare For Lacan on the other hand If I am anything in the picture it is always in the form of the screen    the stain the spot in the scopic field he continues the gaze is outside it belongs as Stephen Melville puts it succinctly not to the small o other but to the Otherlanguage world the fact of a movement of sig nification beyond human meaning26 In Lacans analysis opacity rather than transparency constitutes the structure of visuality But is not the world of the Hollywood musical above all a world that is not opaque a world of transparency where objectslike Fred Astaires mop in the fa mous dance numberare immediately meaningful and obey our every whim where the infirmity and foreignness of the body itself are sud denly transcended as we dance dance dance to borrow the lyrics from Dancers musical number Cvalda As we have seen it is precisely this willingness to hope against hope and believe against belief that is invoked by Cavell in viewing the musical and its dance as an escape from death as facing the music of skepticism by reaffirming the hopes of humanism But what I want to suggest is that part of the films geniusand certainly crucial to its emotional torqueis that it allows Selmas romantic indeed melo dramatic deployment of this solution to her loss of vision as a means of ensuring the worlds consistency while at the same time the film deconstructs that solutionspecifically in how the film outside of Selmas fantasy world is shot For what the film insists on rigorously and systematically is the difference between Selmas vision of the world and the subjects centered place in it as constituted by fantasy and what the world looks like when those fantasies and identifications when you cant believ e your eyes or voice are suspendedwhen they are as it were subjected to analysis In so doing the film uses the pathological fact of Selmas blindness and the compensatory strategies it generates to disclose a radically de constructed notion of the visual very much along the lines of Žižeks gloss on Malbranche with the point being as I put it in chapter 5 with Derrida not that only those who cannot see can see but that even those who cannot see cannot see The films most important musical number Ive Seen It All would seem to register this theoretical point about fantasy and identifi cation very much in the terms discussed by Žižek in his gloss on MUDs multipleuser domains on the Internet that the point of the Lacanian notion of the split or decentered subject is not that there are simply more EgosSelves in the same individual with which one might iden tify but that this decentering is of the void of the subject itself as derailed and constituted by the Symbolic and by the phallus as signifier its hollowing out by the signifier as Lacanians like to say in relation to its content to the bundle of imaginary andor symbolic identifi cations Here we might revisit Selmas repeated rejections in Ive Seen It All of the further identifications held out to her by Jeff of wife of grandmother and so on In her repeated insistence that Ive seen all I need to see the film registers the fact that the subjects division is not the division between one Self and another between two contents but the division between something and nothing between the feature of identi fication and the void27 In this light we can understand Selmas rigor ous insistence that further identifications seeing more in the songs terms will change nothing as a kind of unflinching posthumanisma point punctuated one might say as Selma removes her glasses at the beginning of the number and tosses them into the water then mo ments later wraps her arms around herself and falls to the ground in a fetal position dangerously suicidally near the passing train as a final answer to Jeffs repeated calls for further other identifications with the roles of wife grandmother and so on made available to her To return however to how the film is shot what makes the film posthumanist is that it mobilizes the investment in a traditional fan tasy of vision through its thematization in the story of Selma but at the same time divorces visuality from transcendence identity and the ego around whom visual space might be organized in its cinema when you cant believ e your eyes or voice verité camera work This apparent realism however does not oper ate to put us in touch with some unmediated relationship with the way things are that as we saw with Silvermans critique of aural and visual transcription is not in the cards but instead is calculated to insist that if we ask What does the world look like the answer can only be It doesnt look like anything at alla fact we may index to the films conspicuous foregrounding of the apparent contingency governing the camera work itself This jarring but crucial contrast is prepared for in the films opening moments in the juxtaposition of the operatic overture and its painterly affirmation of subjectcentered vision followed immediately by the mundane local audition for The Sound of Music filmed in a nearly distracting handheld style What all of this suggests is that we are to take the fantasy scenes with their vivid coloration and careful choreography as in the visually stun ning Ive Seen It All or the complexly woven Cvalda in contrast to the devilmaycare shooting and washedout color of the everyday scenesas more real than the documentary reallife scenes from which they supposedly departand that this is precisely their problem To put it in psychoanalytic terms the world paradoxically comes to life only through fantasy but it is the subjects very fantasy itself that bars her from what is really going on in the world itself which obeys its own laws and doesnt look like the subjects desire or anybody elses This doesnt mean that fantasy is being disavowed as if one could escape it only that it is being carefully situated and in a way specific to the medium of film To modify Cavells wonderful insight we might say that film may be what the world looks like when were not there but its not what the world looks like when nobodys there Thats why it doesnt look like anything at all If we want to think of this in deconstructive rather than psycho analytic terms the film might be said to enact what Laura Oswald has called the strategy of cinemagraphia which identifies cinema with those traces of nonpresence such as the splice the cut or the frame that draw attention to the endless productiondeconstruction of the meaning and subject of film discourse across the film frame In so doing cinemagraphia shatters the mirror in which the subject is held as a unity by defining the image as a trace for another image thus exposingand here one might readily think of Dancers relation when you cant believ e your eyes or voice to the Hollywood musical and its techniquesmimesis as the endless pursuit of an illusion28 Cinemagraphia thus subjects the cinematic field to the deconstructive force of what Derrida called the spatial As Derrida characterizes itin remarks that have obvious resonance with our earlier discussion of Žižeks gloss on Malebranche and the prostheticthe painter or the drawer is blind    the hand that paints and draws is the hand of a blind personit is an experience of blind ness Thus the visual arts are also arts of the blind which is to say that the visual is always subjected to the force the spatial which is hetero geneous to the space of the centered subject of humanist visuality29 The spatializing effect of cinemagraphia thus operates wholly counter to the cinematic practice of suture as popularly theorized in 1980s film theory in which the primary identification of the spec tator with the film image by means of the look parallels the childs identification with his or her other and the mOther in the mirror phase of development so that the spectator internalizes the subject positions of characters in the diegesis Cinemagraphia on the other hand shatters the mirror in which the subject is held as unity by de fining the image as a trace for another image30 For this reason as Peter Brunette and David Wills have put it what we find in cinema is the deconstruction of the mimetic operation rather than the con firmation of it and it is in this sense that the screen can be called a hymen As Oswald characterizes it the hymen corresponds to the elusive trace of the film frame joiningseparating elements of the film chain constructingdeconstructing meaning and subjectaddress in film discourse 260 In this lightor in this space perhaps we should now saywe might well take issue with Silvermans impatience with Derridas use of the cognate term invagination which Silverman writes has tended to obscure rather than to foreground the ways in which texts engender their readers and viewers because it is exploited primarily as rhe torical currency In the understanding I am pursuing here nothing would seem to be further from the truth Indeed Derridas rendering of invagination in the essay Living On Border Lines contends that the invaginated structure of all discourse is necessarily repressed by any law by the authorities who demand an author an I capable of or ganizing a narrative sequence of remembering and telling the truth when you cant believ e your eyes or voice Such is the demand for the story he continues the narrative the demand that society the law that governs literary and artistic works medicine the police and so forth claim to constitute This demand for truth is itself recounted and swept along in the endless process of invagination31 The point Derrida is making here as I understand it is that invagination is not merely a rhetorical gesture but quite the contrary is crucial to understanding the relation of sexual difference to questions of institution and lawa point that has obvious relevance for our understanding of a film in which the feminine is subjected to the power of the law in the form of capital punishment What I want to suggest now in combining Derridas rendering of invagination with the psychoanalytic frame of Žižek is that the castration of Selma by blindness and hanging in the film which some reviewers have seen as nothing short of a sadistic manipulation of the audience by the films director operates not only in the service as Silverman would argue of a displacement and projection of preOedipal losses onto the feminine by a phallic regime but rathera much stronger and more complicated ethical project on the films partas the rendering of what Žižek calls the act as feminine Here again as with my earlier discussion of the phallus as signi fier we must revisit according to Žižek one of the most notoriously antifeminist theses of the late Lacan that woman is a symptom of man32 Things look quite different Žižek argues if we focus more carefully on just what the term symptom means in the late Lacan namely as a particular signifying formation which confers on the sub ject its very ontological consistency enabling it to structure its basic constitutive relationship to enjoyment jouissance In these terms the thesis woman is a symptom of man means that man himself exists only through woman qua his symptom all his ontological consistency hangs on is suspended from his symptom is externalized in his symptom In other words man literally exsists his entire being lies out there in woman Woman on the other hand does not exist she insists In this way Žižek continues the relationship to the death drive is also reversed woman taken in herself outside the relation to man embodies the death drive apprehended as a radical most ele mentary ethical attitude of uncompromising insistence    Woman is therefore no longer conceived as fundamentally passive in contrast to when you cant believ e your eyes or voice male activity the act as such in its most fundamental dimension is feminine 156 This is why for Lacan suicide is the epitome of the act considered in this radical ethical dimension it involves a kind of temporary eclipse of the subject in which I put at stake everything including myself my symbolic identity the act is therefore always a crime a transgressionit is mad in the sense of radical un accountability In this act of annihilation we not only dont know what will come out of it its final outcome is ultimately even insignifi cant strictly secondary in relation to the no of the pure act 44 We are now better equipped to understand in a more profound way the ethical project of Dancer in the Dark and how that project might well be the source of the intense polarization of the films audience What is most disturbing about Selmas plight is not that she commits a crime indeed this is merely the motivation of the device as the Russian formalists used to say for the films handling of the relation of the feminine the act and the Law What is far more disturbing and far more ethically significant is her radical passivity in the face of her condemnation even as her friends scurry about in masculine activ ity as Žižek would say to gather new information about her situation contact lawyers and so on Selma herself however chooses to do noth ing and it is this passivity this nowhich culminates of course in her choosing to diethat most forcefully exposes the utter injustice and contingency of the Law the fact that the Law functions precisely to actively and indeed one might now say hysterically cover over the fact that it is constructed across a void All of which helps to explain an intuition that nearly all viewers of the film are bound to share that the most unsatisfactory ending imaginable would be precisely that which is most reasonable Selma using the recovered money to hire a lawyer reopen the case and win her acquittal which would only serve to collapse the very abyss between justice and Law that has been opened up in the film by means of the act as feminine From this vantage we can now understand the full significance of the conspicuous fact in the film of Selmas absent husband curi ously unremarked and unexplained her rejection of Jeffs repeated overtures senselessly as it were and her reclaiming and renam ing of her own nameofthe father in terms of her own psychic co ordinates pretending that he is named Olrich Novy a famous comedic when you cant believ e your eyes or voice songanddance man from her homeland here played by Joel Gray in an altogether unexpected and not entirely successful cameo Here we might say even more pointedly that the father of Gene is not just an absent father he is also lacking and his role has been assumed by Selma whose embodiment of the act as feminine is the films supreme example of ethical agency In these terms Selma assumes the phallic function par excellence in passing on to her son the gift of vision33 but what the father mother passes on to her son is vision without paternal Law vision under the sign of the prosthetic as the very truth of the subjecta fact indexed by the conspicuous oversized eyeglasses that mother and son share as a kind of visual albatross Here we find as David Wills puts it in his wonderful meditation Prosthesis the body as a whole as metonymic signifier of the phallus called into question by means of the prosthesis in which the relation to the other becomes precisely and necessarily a relation of otherness the otherness for ex ample of artificiality attached to or found within the natural a fact neatly indexed here in that Genes natural condition of sight can only exist through prosthetic surgical intervention The relation to the other Wills concludes is thus denied the reconfirmation of same ness that freezes its differential effect rigidifies the oedipal structure and ultimately represses the feminine the homosexual and so on34 What we find here then is a subjection of vision to the force of the prosthetic itself in Selmas assumption of the phallic function of passing along sight to her son And this in turn must now be mapped in terms of the multiple valences of the films posthumanist ethical proj ect of the act as feminine and its exposure of the Laws facticity of the rescripting of the phallic subject as always already prosthetic and of the tearing away of the visual as such from its association with the ontological privilege of the subject Here again we must pay attention to the difference between the films vantage on this drama and Selmas own Selma may think that the vision she is bequeathing to her son is the ability to see a world that looks the way her fantasies doa world that is in a word beautifulbut the film has long since insisted that the world outside Selmas fantasy the world she merely inhabits will not look like anything in particular at all From the films vantage she doesnt hand down to her son her world in other words but simply a worldvision without the phallus and with no guarantees Indeed when you cant believ e your eyes or voice to put it paradoxically we could say that Selma hears in the aural do main the truth of the visual as she frantically listens at the ventilation grate in her cell for any sound at all Here the signposts for the subject on the way to the void are clear music then noise then silence In this light as Žižek puts it in his writing on David Lynch the flatness of reality that we find in various forms of visual representa tion PreRaphaelite painting for instance effectively cancels the per spective of infinite openness that we associate with the Newtonian Cartesian worldview and finds its counterpart in a certain ontological or primordial concept of noise that is constitutive of space itself it is not a noise in space but a noise that keeps space open as such the very texture that holds reality togetherif this noise were to be eradicated reality itself would collapse This noise is therefore in a sense Žižek concludes the very sound of silence35 It is this noise this very texture of reality that Selma listens for in her jail cell having now been deprived of music noise at the moment before it passes over as it is bound to do for Selma into music into a kind of becoming voice that reassures the subject that she still exists What I am suggest ing then is that in the end Dancer in the Dark stages the problem of sound and voice in terms that are amenable to Cavell and to the rather different analyses of Žižek and Derrida and it does so by means of a double articulation that insists on the fundamental difference between Selmas psychic drama and the films larger project Selmas drama may indeed be read in terms of the topos of Cavellian skepticism the loss of the world thematized through Selmas blindness that enableseven necessitates one might saythe recovery of another world flush with this one a world organized around the subject into which we may step under the guidance or spur as it were of the voice For the film however this drama is quite clearly reframed as only fantasy For Selma as character sound is always already crossing over into a musi cality that is further circumscribedmade all the more melodious one might sayin terms of the Hollywood musical and its conven tions but for the film music is a kind of postCagean phenomenon in which the difference between music and sound is uncertain and un stable posed anew each moment in the clacking of train tracks the clamor of the factory floor and the scratching of the courtroom sketch artists pencil when you cant believ e your eyes or voice of Björk herself which seems to have more in common with the film and director you might say than with Selma the character What I am tempted to call the posthumanist voice of Björks performance ranges rapidly and without warning from the operatic to the flatly verbal to the almost guttural and all points in between as if the voice itself were one minute the disembodied transmission of spirit as Cavell might have it and the next minute a sampling of various sounds styles and mannerisms not all of them what we usually think of as vocal music at all What Björks vocal style seems to emphasize at such moments is not so much that voice floats free of the world and points to another better one adjacent to this one as Cavell would have it but that voice is always already hollowed out as Lacan would say by sound that stain or thing that forms the undissolvable residuum of enjoyment that the phallusasprosthesis at once generates and attempts to gen trify It is as Žižek would put it the remainder of the voice that para doxically comes before the voice Here we find a concept of voice that is diametrically opposed to what I have called Cavells Selmacentric one Indeed from Žižeks perspective voice as we find it in the operatic aria provides perhaps the neatest exemplification of what Lacan calls jouissense enjoymeant the moment at which sheer selfconsuming enjoyment of the voice eclipses meaning the words of the aria36 For Žižek voiceand this is dramatized in the transition from silent film to early talkiesfunctions as a strange body which smears the innocent surface of the picture a ghostlike apparition which can never be pinned to a definite visual object37 Here we find an explanation for Charlie Chaplins wellknown aversion to sound which is thus not to be dismissed as a simple nostalgic commitment to a silent paradise it reveals a far deeper than usual knowledge or at least presentiment of the disruptive power of the voice of the fact that the voice functions as a foreign body as a kind of parasite introducing a radical split38 Here then on the site of voice we can not only move toward a provisional summation of the theoretical and ethical stakes involved in Dancer in the Dark but also greatly enhance our understanding of one of the most important junctures in postmodern philosophy by using Žižek to triangulate the wellknown disagreement between Derrida and Cavell over the question of ordinary language philosophy of which when you cant believ e your eyes or voice the problem of voice may now be seen as but an especially pitched mo ment Here we need to recall however briefly the most explicit epi sode of all in this triangulationnamely Cavells disagreement with Derridas reading of Austin in Limited Inc and beyond that his critique of voice as we find it in Derridas early book on Husserl Derridas cri tique of voice as exemplary of logocentrism and the metaphysics of presence from the early work on Husserl through Of Grammatology and on to his later work is surely too wellknown to need restatement here What is less known perhaps is Cavells response which will serve to link him in an odd and unexpected way though finally not a decisive one with Žižek Cavells reading takes place over many pages chiefly in A Pitch of Philosophy and is often complex and technical centering on Derridas understanding of concepts in Austin such as felicity force signa ture andthe one for which Austin is best knownthe performa tive To put it schematicallyand I have already explored this diver gence in somewhat different terms in chapter 3the gist of Cavells objection is that he finds Derrida misreading Austins philosophical project even though for Cavell both Austin and Derrida seem to be brothers in arms against the metaphysical tradition As Cavell elo quently puts it Both are philosophers of limitation both interested in the morality and politics of speech out of something like a shared sense that concepts without the most scrupulous attention impose and are imposed upon us and both take the struggle against metaphysics as a struggle for liberation for something more than reason as it were itself Most sig nificantly perhaps there is an appreciation of the fact Austins analysis of the performative may be seen to be motivated precisely as an attack on what deconstruction attacks under the name logocentrism39 The question for Cavell is this why does Derrida not recognize his common cause with Austin and find in him instead an example of the metaphysical tradition against which Cavell sees both aligned For Cavell the answer is that Derrida is blinded by his toohasty aver sion to voice although voice for Austin and for Wittgenstein means the voice of the everyday or the ordinaryand they call it this ac cording to Cavell precisely to contrast their appeal with the appeal to when you cant believ e your eyes or voice metaphysics More than thisand this I think is the nub of the issue for CavellDerrida is every bit as opposed    to the metaphysical voice as Austin and Wittgenstein are But he makes it his business to monitor and to account for its encroachments while seeming    to be speaking in it no one more cheerfully in a voice that suggests its final overcoming that is that suggests that it will end philosophi cally 62 In the end then Cavell finds Derridas critique of Austins concept of voiceasmetaphysical to be in fact exemplary of the metaphysical voice at work in Derrida himselfthe metaphysical explicitly as a flight from the ordinary and its vexations into what one might call system atic philosophy As Cavell puts it in Philosophical Passages What I think Derrida is objecting to here is something he was already in flight from the specter of the ordinary which manifests itself in Derridas repeated gestures that of course he is not denying that there are ef fects of the ordinaryincluding most famously signatureswhich for Cavell furthers the air of implication that there is something more to doa further reality to assess a fullness of certainty to applythan human beings can compass 74 And in so doing Derrida for Cavell exemplifies the philosophical desire to silence the voice of the ordinary and the everyday exemplifies the desire in a somewhat different reg ister to transcend the human in the most homely and downtoearth sense of the term My concern at the moment is not to register my agreement or res ervations about Cavells reading of Derrida but to point out that a cer tain understanding of what we might think of as the unavoidability of the problem of voice links Žižek to this aspect of Cavell through what one might call a materialist gesture over and against the critique of phonocentrism in Derrida For both Žižek and Cavell the voice in sists it obtrudes we cannot free ourselves of it through critique or deconstruction or anything else More important however is how this fact helps sharpen our sense of the difference between Cavells humanist voice and the rather different understanding made available by Žižek For both the presence of the voice may be coterminous with everything that makes us human but for Žižek that human turns out to be inhabited at its core by the inhuman Thing that resides at the heart of the humanist subject To put it telegraphically for Cavell the when you cant believ e your eyes or voice fear or danger is over the loss of voice but for Žižek the fear or danger is precisely that the voice can never be losta point he makes in ex plicit contrast to Derridas reading of phonocentrism What Derrida remains blind to Žižek writes is the radical ambiguity of the voice The voicephenomenon in its very presence is simultaneously the Lacanian Real the nontransparent stain that puts an irreducible ob stacle in the way of the subjects selftransparency a foreign body in its midst In short the greatest hindrance to the selftransparency of Logos is the voice itself in its inert presence40 But if a certain materialist gesture links Cavell and Žižek on the question of the voice over and against what Cavell sees as Derridas metaphysical bent what Žižek has called his quasitranscendental side 195 that is not I think the whole story What is at issue here is also the disposition of that materialism and on those grounds Žižek and Derrida must be paired in sharp contrast with Cavells humanism We can bring this difference into focus by heeding Cavells assertion in The World Viewed on silent film that the world is silent to us the silence is merely forever broken 15051 What this silence registers for Cavell of course is our distance from the world under skepticism a silence merely forever broken by our words that can never bridge that distance can never be words of the world How different this is from Žižeks analysis of primordial or ontological sound in David Lynch where what is registered is instead that the world is never silent and that this noisiness which is also a queasiness is an index of our inability to achieve distance from the world of things and the Real It is precisely this factthat the Thing is in the subject more than the subject itselfthat generates the overarching prosthetic logic of the phallus as master signifier which then dialectically generates through its failure to gentrify the Real the very residuum of the Thing the stain and so on that constitutes the Symbolics raison dêtre Or to put it in Žižekian shorthand no meaning without enjoyment and no enjoyment without nauseating remainder What becomes clear here then is that for Žižek and Derrida the disposition of this materialism is handled in and through différance through the Master the phallus as signifier in which subject and ob ject are enfolded to return to the ethical topos of the feminine in an es sentially invaginated relationship whereas in Cavell their difference when you cant believ e your eyes or voice and distance are as Derrida might say too pure Indeed it is that purity of distance that calls forth the voice as in operatic aria which registers either ecstasy at overcoming that distance or melancholy at its unsurpassability41 But the larger point I wish to make is this the question here is one not simply of materialismof counterposing the ordinary or the Real to the supposed formalism of deconstruction but more importantly of the prosthetic nature of the ordinary and the everyday itself42 To put it another way materialism itself is not a pure category that stands in its purity in opposition to formalism or idealism but is instead itself constituted by difference by enfolding and being enfolded within that which it is not43 And on this point the decisive difference is between not Žižek and Derrida on one side and Cavell on the other but between Žižek and Derrida themselves Žižek has offered in several places what he sees as Lacans ma terialist answer to Derrida and deconstruction44 In Tarrying with the Negative for instance he writes that Lacan accepts the deconstruc tionist motif of radical contingency but turns this motif against itself using it to assert his commitment to Truth as contingent45 More to the point for our purposes perhaps is the series of questions raised in Žižeks SelfInterview at the end of The Metastases of Enjoyment where he takes issue with Derridas failure to acknowledge fully the ultimate identity of supplement and MasterSignifier For Derrida Žižek writes the supplement is the undecidable margin that eludes the MasterSignifier whereas Lacan    locates this undecidability in the very heart of the MasterSignifier    The MasterSignifier proper emerges through the neutralization of the supplement through the obliteration of its constitutive indecidability whereas Derrida insists on the reduction of the Lacanian Symbolic to the balanced economy of exchangereferenced to the gold standard as it were of the phallusand in so doing fails to take note of how in his own theo retical edifice the notion of gift of a primordial there is    intro duces an aspect that is heterogeneous to the standard Derridean prob lematic of différancetracewriting as presence itself in its ultimate inaccessibility46 To acknowledge as much however is to realize instantly that the point cuts both ways Žižeks reinterpretation of the phallusand therefore of the ethics of the act as feminineis possible only by when you cant believ e your eyes or voice virtue of an understanding of the phallus as signifier whose status as such is crucial if Žižek is to avoid the alltooobvious objection that the Lacanian Real may be characterized more pointedly than any term we have thus far queried as positing a form of metaphysical materi alism to quote Derrida which posits an ultimate referent or be comes an objective reality absolutely anterior to any work of the mark the semantic content of a form of presence which guarantees the movement of the text in general from the outside47 Žižek may dif ferentiate Lacanian theory from poststructuralism by means of truth as contingent but as Judith Butler has repeatedly noted By linking this contingency with the real and interpreting the real as the trauma induced through the threat of castration the Law of the Father this law is posited as accountable for the contingency in all ideological determinations but is never subject to the same logic of contingency that it securesin which case Žižeks theory thus evacuates the con tingency of its contingency48 This is a rather different point from the critique we saw Derrida making of Lacan in chapter 2 and it is crucial for assessing Žižeks rela tionship not only to poststructuralism but also to feminism As Butler asks in a rhetorical question if ever there was one Is there not a dif ference between a theory that asserts that in principle every discourse operates through exclusion and a theory that attributes to that outside specific social and sexual positions 189 as in Lacanian theorys as sociation of the feminine body with the domain of the Real the Thing the stain and so on Here in other words everything hinges on the deconstructive valence of Žižeks account of the phallusasprosthesis as long asand only as long aswe insist on the phallus as signifier and subject the Law to an essentially deconstructive understanding we are able to move Žižek away from the consequences ferreted out by Butler Only then can we sustain the ethical transvaluation of the feminine for psychoanalytic theory that Žižek wants to pursue49a transvalua tion that might make common cause with Butlers own theorization of the plasticity of the phallus as directly linked to its status as signi fier in a structure that has to be reiterated and as reiterable becomes open to variation and plasticity thus opening sexual difference as a site of proliferative resignifications as in for example Butlers own theorization of the lesbian phallus 89 Of course to arrive at such when you cant believ e your eyes or voice in Žižek requires insisting on the very deconstructive reading of the phallus that he wants to simultaneously criticize and mobilize All of which would seem willfully perverse orwe are now in a position to saynecessarily prosthetic What Žižek helps us to see then is that in Dancer in the Dark we find a powerful posthumanist project that unhinges the humanist coordinates of vision in relation to spatiality and voice in relation to noise while poignantly staging their fantasy structures glossed so well by Cavell And he helps disclose as Cavells work does how those structures are deployed in specific ways by the genres and conventions of film as a medium More decisively in relation to Cavells work he gives us an even sharper sense of how the film undertakes this mobi lization and undoing of those visual and vocal modes in terms not so much of the total animal sensorium and its many modes of being in the world that I discussed in chapters 2 3 and 5 or even in this last in questioning the distinction between disability and normality but rather in drawing out the radical sense of the feminine and its ethical force in the film its assault on the regime of the phallus and the Law its perverse and devastating force But in evacuating the contingency of its contingency to use Butlers phrase in not fully confronting the consequences of that contingency as necessitating a fundamentally different critical logic that forces us beyond the simple dialectical reversal and elevation of the terms banished by humanism to subservient status the Real the Thing the feminine and so on Žižeks work remains within the purview of the very humanism that his radical sense of the feminine wants to eclipse In doing so it stops short of the full articulation of the feminine in another even deeper sense its invaginated relationship with prostheticity that obeys a fundamentally different posthumanist logic The work of art is an ostentatiously improbable occurrence niklas luhmann Art as a Social

in the winning entry1 They are also remark able for another reason as experiments in how to think anew the re lationship between nature and culture orto use a distinction I bor rowed a few years ago from the political scientist Tim Lukebetween green and gray ecologies2 Indeed one might ask what else can the seemingly innocuous phrase urban park mean at this moment in time other than this very necessity Green ecologies ecologies of the organic the living the biomass and gray ecologies of the machinic and technological the electronic Or to put it in the terms used by Bernard Tschumis proposal for Downsview ecologies of the coyote and ecologies of the digital3 In fact how the Tschumi proposal handles the term digital is a good example of what I mean On the one hand it refers to electroni cally mediated mass culture based on binary coding the sort of thing associated with the large image screens that are a central part of his design on the other hand the digital harkens back etymologically to the digits the fingers Here it would be temptingand entirely to the pointto recall Jacques Derridas reading of the figure of the hand in relation to the natureculture opposition in Heidegger that was lose the building discussed in earlier chapters In Derridas Geschlecht II Heideggers Hand for example the hand stands as we have seen as a symptom of Heideggers alltooproblematic ontological opposition of the world of the human and the world of the animal For Heidegger the mean ing of the hand properly understood is determined not by biological or utilitarian functiondoes not let itself be determined as a bodily organ of gripping4but by its expression of the geschlecht or species being of humanity which in opposition to the rest of creation rests on the human possession of speech and thought which in turn opens an abyss between the grasping or prehension associated with the prehensile organs of the ape5 and the hand of man which is far from these in an infinite way unendlich through the abyss of its being6 To misunderstand the hand of the human as determined by util ity and function is to repeat the sin of Western conceptualizing as a kind of sublimized violence as Stanley Cavell has put it a sort of clutching or grasping through what we might call prehensile conceptualization This mode of violence is most famously thematized in Heidegger of course as the violence expressed in the world do minion of technology7 For the matter at hand at hand we could scarcely do better than to remember Heideggers aversion to the type writer and typographic mechanization which is asignifying because it loses the hand as Heidegger puts it in its anonymous standardiza tion and in its spacing of elements it destroys the unity of thinking speaking and writing And thus Heidegger laments In typewriting all men resemble one another8 For Heidegger then the proper sub servience of the technological to the human rests on a prior ontological opposition between the natural and the human the prehensile and the comprehensile we might say here figured pointedly as the difference between the Man of the Hand and to return to Tschumi the Coyote who is condemned forever to wander between the ontological orders of the stone at one end of the Heideggerian universe and the world of spirit of being as such that is proper only to the human at the other Remembering Heidegger on technology helps throw into relief as well the very different and distinctly contemporary reconjugation of the technical and the natural that we find in the Downsview Park proposals We could call this reconjugation postmodern I suppose to mark its opposition to Heideggers modernism but it seems to me that what is going on in the Downsview proposals is something dis tinct and different from the associations that usually cluster around that term Here the double take on the digital in Tschumis proposal is again suggestive for thinking about the proposals as a whole and it is useful to remember that the etymology of digit refers not only to the terminal divisions of the hand as the OED so sharply puts it but also to a unit of measurement used for example by the Romans In the Tschumi proposal the digital refers also to a perimeter landscape of earthworks that interlocks with the interior like the cupped fingers of the left and right handa figure that appears as well in the ravine structure proposed in the Brown and Storey entry They are fingers of nature that increase the interface between natural artifacts and cultural ones and can be compared to the fractal phenomenon of viscous fingering Indeed Tschumi and his collaborators argue The fractal dimension of all edges and interfaces in the Park is a crucial ele ment of our strategyhence the relevance of remembering the digit as a unit of measurebecause such fractal phenomena as John Casti puts it exhibit linear selfsimilarity in the sense that any part of the object is exactly like the whole that is to say they have exactly the same degree of irregularity at all scales of measurement9 The digital in Tschumis proposal points then in two differ ent directions and in doing so it provides a dense and compressed instance of a new way of theorizing the relations of nature and cul ture at work in the Downsview proposals as a whole Emergence selforganizational unfoldings circuit and throughflow ecologies sustaining and multiplying complexity over time webs of strong attractors and grammar strings open phasing functionbased circuit systems there are important differences between these con cepts but what they all have in common is that they thoroughly take for granted the conceptual apparatus of systems theory which is based on the central innovation of replacing the familiar ontological duali ties of the philosophical traditionchiefly for our purposes culture and naturewith the functional distinction between system and environment As we know from earlier chapters systems are selfreferential and selfproducingthey are autopoietic to use Maturana and Varelas termand they secure their autopoiesis by using distinctions based on lose the building a selfreferential constitutive code to selectively filter and respond to an environment that is always already infinitely more complex than any given system But what is important for our purposes at the mo ment is that there is a reciprocal relationship here of cospecification the environment is not simply given that would land us back into a thinly disguised concept of nature in the traditional sense but is in a crucial sense produced It is always the environment of the system the outside or unmarked space produced by the constitutive act of dis tinction and selection that any system uses to secure its operations As Niklas Luhmann succinctly puts it The environment receives its unity through the system and only in relation to the system    It is differ ent for every system because every system excludes only itself from its environment10 In this way what was previously a rigid uncrossable ontological boundary between two sides of the distinctionbetween nature and culture between the biological and the mechanical and so onis now made dynamic and as it were portable in the sense that the same formal mechanism may now be used to think and link across what were in the past discrete ontological domains For example this enables one to compare quite precisely thermoregulation in biological systems with the selfregulation of thermostatic mechanical systems or to model the firing of neurons and the behaviors of neuronal nets using digital technologies Now the pragmatic payoffs here would seem obvious enough for the attempts to think through the interlacing of ecological transporta tional and other systems in the Downsview proposals But what I wish to stress is not just a pragmatic and functional shift but a philosophical one as well in which the question of the relationship between nature and culture can now be deontologized and posed anew not as questions of what but as questions of how not as questions of substance but as questions of strategywhich has of course profound implications for the design process It is only in light of such a shift that we can make sense for example of Koolhaas and Maus contention in their winning Tree City entry that instead of restoring Downsview to a previous natural state Tree City manufactures nature for civic ends It is a fabri cated landscape    100 artificial and 100 natural    unambigu ously administrative in ambition AND entirely organic in spirit Here however we need to recall the important differences I have discussed in earlier chapters between firstorder and secondorder systems theory Firstorder systems theory is more typically concerned with processes of homeostasis positive feedback steering and the like think here of the work of Gregory Bateson or Norbert Wiener secondorder systems theory is concerned with complexity contin gency and how they relate to processes that now go by the names of emergence and selforganization In this light all the proposals are framed and informed not just by systems theory in some vague sense but specifically by secondorder systems theory Here the rhetoric of the Emergent Ecologies proposal of Corner and Allen could scarcely be more representative Our approach they write is emergent and dynamic an organizational matrix for the life of the site to unfold in which the landscape of circuits and flows simply guides or steers the always emergent processes of  matter and information Similarly Brown and Storeys Emergent Landscapes project proposes an evolving landscape of stages phases of order and stability a tableau of evolv ing relationships momentum and selforganizing structures Or fi nally Foreign Offices new synthetic landscape grows from the com mitment that faced with complexity we respond by sustaining and multiplying that complexity over time I do not mean to ignore the considerable differences between these proposals and the strategies they employ I intend simply to highlight the fact that embracing the paradigms of emergence and selforganization creates a new and in fact fundamental problem a medium associated above all with space now has as its constitutive problem time and temporalizationmore specifically how to tempo ralize design and the constraints and selections built into it What is threatened hereor promised depending on how one looks at itis that the architectural medium is thereby submitted to a kind of dema terialization or decomposition by the problem of time Hereand this is a question to which I will return in the final chapterthe problem of time cannot be separated from the question of specific media indeed what is brought into sharp focus in the relation of time and media is times own asynchronicity over and against what Louis Althusser once called an ideological concept of time as selfidentical seamless and continuous across all spaces Once we pay attention to specific media the problem of time in relation to design becomes a question of lose the building specific speeds and velocities and how to coordinate them biological and ecological elements and systems have certain rates of development change and decay of course but so do buildings and other structures which are subject to quite different speeds The Downsview entries confront this problem on a spectrum ranging from Foreign Office and Tschumi at one endwhich produce a tight coupling of temporal horizons and possible scenarios with rela tively hardwired structural commitments up front ones that predis pose some temporal horizons and not othersto Corner and Allen and Koolhaas and Mau at the other in which this relationship is one of relatively loose coupling This problem of time in relation to specific media framed of necessity by the embrace of the paradigm of emer gence is registered in an especially pointed way in the KoolhaasMau proposal in which the landscape will be prioritized over the realm officially known as architecture and which makes what is humor ously called the ultimate sacrifice of the construction of costly new buildings and devotes those resources instead to the temporalization of the designs meaning through a different medium with a different speed the vegetal In Tree City the reduction of hard commitments up front is a strategy for engaging in what Luhmann calls the temporalization of complexity11of how the complexity of the internal relations of the parks elements can remain responsive over time to changing and unanticipated demands from its surrounding environment To put it schematically power over space in the short run in the form of struc tures and buildings is swapped for power over time in the long run and thereforeto put perhaps too fine a point on ittime not space becomes the constitutive medium of the project In this sense the looseness or weakness of the coupling of temporal horizons and structural elements in Koolhaas and Mau is precisely its strength And from this vantage the constitutive question for the Downsview proj ect becomes something like Can you wait to which Tree City pro vides what we might think of as the slowest answer There is however a final less obvious relation between systems theory and the Downsview proposals at work here and that is the question of their relationship to different observational schema within what Luhmann calls functionally differentiated society To put it sche matically the park is not a thingcertainly not an objectbut rather an accretion of distinctions and selections made from within a par ticular observational system and its codea point registered in the jury reports concluding statement that Tree City outlines a vision of future park lands as intriguing as a work of art but also as malleable as communities of tomorrow could wish to find From this vantage the aesthetic or antiaesthetic of Koolhaas and Mau may be seen as a refusal of design composition pictorialism and the like in favor of a strategy of production and temporalization On the other hand Rem Koolhaas and Bruce Mau final panel art no 3 for Tree City 2000 lose the building howeverand I will explore this question in much more detail when I examine the Blur project of Diller  Scofidioinsofar as we are to regard these projects as something like art then those choices must be seen not only as aesthetic ones but quite exemplary aesthetic ones at that From one observational schema then the park may be viewed as a functional component of the larger urban space for which and in which it provides certain services in which case the question is not its autonomy but precisely the opposite how it functions as an element within a larger matrix of social systems of which it is part On the other hand it may be viewed as part of the social system of art in which case the question is precisely its autonomy and how that autonomy commu nicates the larger problem of the autopoiesis of art as a social system in functionally differentiated society If we keep in mind these differencesand keep in mind that they are irreducible that there is no totalizing perspective from which one observation may be subordinated to the otherthen the Park is quite literally a different entity depending on the observational schema we use which system we choose transportation economic aesthetic and so on as the lens through which to view the park as an agent of that systems autopoiesis And hence the design decisions about spe cific media in the proposalssay the use or refusal of the realm of ficially known as architecturetake on quite different functions and meanings depending on which observation we deploy It is this irre ducible difference between different observational schemas that is ad dressed most cannily by Koolhaas and Mau precisely because of what we might think of as Tree Citys weaknessits underspecification its refusal to commitwhich makes it more available to the autopoiesis of other systems in ways not precluded up front by choices made now This does not mean that there is no strategy to Tree City indeed this is its strategy At the same time however that underspecification must be justi fied on not merely functional but aesthetic grounds and it is here that the proposal of Koolhaas and Mau is cannily anti or postrepresenta tionalist in its refusal to try to do it all to include or represent the various elements of the society that surrounds it From this vantage the vantage of the Downsview projects seen now as communications within the social system of artthe temporal dimension of the pro simply the alibi for specific design decisions made right now as inter ventions in the contemporary fields of architecture design and art Viewed this way a major challenge faced by all the entriesand par ticularly by those that rely on a tight juxtaposition of the digital and the coyote to return to Tschumis terms or that deploy something like the dual mode of Foreign Officeis not so much the problem of composition but rather how that problem relates to a second one of thematization to which Koolhaas and Mau seem especially sensitive Once the natureculture distinction has been replaced by the sys temenvironment distinctionas is certainly the case with all these entriesthe problem then becomes how not to reproduce the histori cally founding and framing conundrum of what we might call the ideology of the park within the park itself In these termsbecause the systemenvironment distinction is operative at every level and has nothing to do with the apparently cognate distinction nature culturethe problem is not so much how to escape this conundrum as how to effectively displace it Here the entries that place a premium on the initial outlay of large architectural structures and gray ecologi cal spectacles face special challenges since they would seem to run a much greater risk of reinstating via thematization the very distinction between nature and the social thattheoretically at leastthey say has already been abandoned Theoretically speaking the outside pro duced by such architectural structuresthe unmarked space generated by their constitutive distinctions and selections that make them this structure and not some otherneed not have anything to do with the question of nature and in fact the relevance of those distinctions lies in the terms we are now using in relation to other architectural struc tures As Luhmann puts it A spatial position defines itself by providing access to other places Architecture determines how the context of the edifice is to be seen A sculpture defines its surrounding space12 And in this sense these projects run a greater risk of inviting the mistake we might say of a thematized reading that they in principle reject To put it another way as Luhmann does in Art as a Social System the question is how a work of art presents itself to perception in such a way as to be recognizable as artor in the case of Downsview Park how we would know we had wandered not only into a park and not lose the building some undesigned wasteland in the middle of the city but a park built now and not a hundred years ago As we will see later in the chapter the concept of form is crucial here and in it two requirements must be fulfilled and inscribed into perception the form must have a bound ary and there must be an unmarked space excluded by this boundary 45 This is obvious enough in works enclosed with a beginning and end as in narrative fiction a stage as in drama or a framing de vice But sculpture or architecture presents an entirely different case Luhmann argues Here the boundary does not draw the viewers attention inward but instead directs it outward The work permits no view into its depths no penetration of its surface whatever the surface may betray of the works mass volume or material The imaginary space is projected outward in the form of distinctions suggested by the work itself Here too space is workspecific space visible so long as the focus is on the work and disappearing from view when the focus shifts to surrounding objectsto the weeds in the castle garden 4546 It would be tempting at this juncture to invoke the wellknown distinction between the rhizomatic and arborescent in Deleuze and Guattaria reading suggested by what the jury report calls the mesh of connections cast over the surrounding area by Tree City Indeed one might very well view the project with its one thousand paths and what Bob Somol has characterized as its viral or cancer ous infection of the surrounding suburbs as an attempt to transform the arborescent Tree into the rhizomatic Tree City in a perversely humorous literalization whose primary message is Hey trees are as close to architecture as youre going to get in this project Indeed what is immediately most striking about the Koolhaas and Mau proposal is precisely its negativity its posture of refusal its repeated insistence on what it has opted not to do as much as what it doesin making the ul timate sacrifice of not doing architecture its refusal to spend money and so on And once this fundamental displacement is made it is as if everything in the proposal must now be read in quotation marks it is a kind of antiproposal or better still the kind of miming that Derrida as sociates with dissemination which is not an achievement of represen tationalism and mimesis but precisely its displacement and erosion13 This makes Tree City in the end a quite contemporary interven tion one very different from an earlier moment of the postmodern in architecture in which quotation and the like attempts as Luhmann puts it to copy a differentiated and diverse environment into the art work which in turn only raises the further problem of whether and in what way the work can claim unity and whether it can assert itself against its own  requisite variety14 How Luhmann asks can the art system reflect on its own differentiation not only in the form of theory but also in individual works of art In this light we might well view the mode of negativity and refusal of miming in the pro posal of Koolhaas and Mau as a kind of effort to displace any materi alization of a commitment that might temporally constrain and chain their project to a structural representation that ceases to be relevant the moment it comes into being And in thisto reach back now to Heidegger with whom we beganthe unhandsomeness of Tree City to use Stanley Cavells phrase is exactly what is most fetching about it it refuses to grasp and fix the present for us and in so doing it imag ines the futureor at least lets say a bit more modestly a future Diller  Scofidios Blur The kinds of formal innovations we find in Tree City what and how they signify how they mobilize an uncanny dematerialization of the architectural medium as part of a radical formal statement how they engage in an ingenious conceptual displacement of the problem of com position these form the fundamental concerns as well in my view of Ricardo Scofidio and Elizabeth Dillers audacious Blur project The Blur buildinga manufactured cloud with an embedded viewing deck hov ering over the Lake of Neuchâtel in Switzerlandseems to have en joyed nearly universal acclaim from the moment it opened to the public in October 2002 as part of Media Expo 02 The reasons for this are not far to seek they range from what a Swiss newspaper reviewer char acterized as the liberating effect of the zany cloud on the crotchety SwissWhat a crazy idiosyncratic thing How deliciously without purpose he exclaimedto Diller  Scofidios knowing deployment of the relationship between public architecture the history and function of the exposition as a social form and the manufacture and use of spec tacle in relation to both15 lose the building The project went through many different elaborations enhance ments and embellishments between the invitation to Diller  Scofidio to participate in July 1998 and the closing of the expo in October 2002 Almost all of these were for various reasons unrealized in the final project At one point the cloud was to house an LED text forest of vertical LED panels that would scroll texteither from an Internet feed including live chat produced by visitors to the structure or in a later version produced by an artist such as Jenny Holzer Blur 163 324 Another idea early on was an adjacent Hole in the Water restau rant made of submerged twin glass cylinders with an aquarium layer in between in which diners would sit at eye level with the lake and eat sushi 100111 Another was an openair Angel Bar embedded in the upper part of the cloud in which patrons could select from an end less variety of the only beverage served there waterartesian waters sparkling waters waters from both glacial poles and municipal tap waters from around the world tastings can be arranged we are told 14655 Yet another elaborate idea rather late in the projects evolu tion involved the distribution of smart raincoatsor braincoats to visitors to the cloud which would indicate through both sound and Diller Scofidio  Renfro Blur 2002 color affinity or antipathy to other visitors on the basis of a preferences questionnaire filled out upon entry to the cloud 20951 As even this brief list suggests the project went through many permutations In the endnot least for reasons of moneywhat we are left with in Blur is the manufactured cloud with the Angel Deck now not a water bar but a viewing deck nestled at its crest For rea sons I will try to explain by way of contemporary systems theory the fact that these permutations and sideline enhancements were not real ized in the end is not entirely a bad thing because it rivets our atten tion not only on what has captivated most viewers from the beginning but also on what makes the project a paradigmatic instance of how contemporary architecture responds to the complexities of its broader social environment in terms of its specific mediumand that is as Diller  Scofidio put it the radicality of an absent building 15 the remarkable audacious commitment to a building that was not a building at all but a manufactured cloud the making as they put it of nothing This fundamental commitment was sounded by Diller  Scofidio early and often at the core of the project as it were was no core at all but a commitment to something featureless depthless scaleless spaceless massless surfaceless and contextless 162 And this overriding concern was reiterated at the end of the design phase about a year before the expo opened in an important communiqué from Diller in which she writes BLUR is not a building BLUR is pure atmosphere water particles sus pended in midair The fog is a dynamic phantom mass which changes form constantly    In contradiction to the tradition of Expo pavilions whose exhibitions entertain and educate BLUR erases information Expos are usually competition grounds for bigger and better technologi cal spectacles BLUR is a spectacle with nothing to see Within BLUR vi sion is put outoffocus so that our dependence on vision can become the focus of the pavilion She adds in boldface type The media project must be liberated from all immediate and obvious metaphoric associations such as clouds god angels ascension dreams Greek mythology or any other kitsch rela tionships Rather BLUR offers a blank interpretive surface 325 Not quite blank as it turns out In fact on the conceptual side of lose the building the project the perceptual experience of the Blur building was thought by the architects at different stages in its development to either meta phorize or conversely throw into relief a larger set of dynamics around electronic media and how we relate to it Midway through the project in a presentation to a media sponsor they characterized it this way To blur is to make indistinct to dim to shroud to cloud to make vague to obfuscate Blurred vision is an impairment A blurry image is the fault of mechanical malfunction in a display or reproduction tech nology For our visually obsessed highresolutionhighdefinition cul ture blur is equated with loss    Our proposal has little to do with the mechanics of the eye but rather the immersive potential of blur on an environmental scale Broadcast and print media feed our insa tiable desire for the visual with an unending supply of images    but as an experience the Blur building offers little to see It is an immersive environment in which the world is put out of focus so that our visual dependency can be put into focus 195 At a different stageone in which the LED text forest played a central rolethe experience of the cloud figures the unimaginable magni tude speed and reach of telecommunications As Diller  Scofidio put it Unlike entering a building the experience of entering this hab itable medium in which orientation is lost and time is suspended is like an immersion in ether It is a perfect context for the experience of another allpervading yet infinitely elastic massless mediumone for the transmission and propagation of information the Internet The project aims to produce a technological sublime felt in the scaleless and unpredictable mass of fog16 There are some interesting differences here In the first version the resonance of the project falls on the iconographic and visually based forms of mass media in the second it is the ephemeral yet pervasive presence of electronic digital forms of telecommunication generally that is in question In the first the point of the cloud is that it deprives us of the unproblematic visual clarity immediacy and transparency that the mass media attempt to produce in consumers in the second the clouds water vapor metaphorically envelops us in the electronic ether that we inhabit like a medium in contemporary life but deprives us of the information that usually accompanies it and therefore dis tracts us from just how immersed in that medium we are What I am more concerned with here however is not the differences between the two accounts but what they have in common that this particular form has been selected by Diller  Scofidio and selected moreover to represent the unrepresentablehence the notion of the technological sublime on which both accounts converge We ought not however take this notion of the sublime or the term representation for that matter at face value In fact resorting to the discourse of the sublime here can only obscure the specificity of the projects formal decisionswhy it does what it does how it does and how those decisions are directly related to the ethical and political point that the project is calculated to make At its worst it leads down the sorts of blind alleys we find in the July 2002 issue of Architecture where one reviewer reads the project in terms of the symbolic sig nificance of clouds and of Switzerland in romantic literature Mary Shelleys Frankenstein among others and painting J M W Turner among others all of which is supposedly mobilized in Blurs rewriting of the sublime as a cautionary tale about the environment17 And all of which recycles exactly the sorts of immediate and obvious meta phoric associations and kitsch relationships that we rightly saw Diller railing against a moment ago It might seem more promising at least at first glance to pursue more adventurous renderings of the sublime in contemporary theory most notably in the work of JeanFrançois Lyotard though other recent renditions of the concept such as what we find in Slavoj Žižeks conju gation of Kant and Lacan might be invoked here as well In Lyotard to stay with the bestknown examplethe locus classicus is a certain reading of Kant The sublime is rendered as a kind of absolute outside to human existenceone that is for that very reason terrifying At the same time paradoxically and this is true of Žižeks rendering as well that radically other outside emerges as a product of the human subjects conflict with itself a symptom of the Enlightenment subject running up against its own limits In Lyotards famous rendering of the Kantian sublime in The Postmodern Condition it emerges from the conflict between the faculty to conceive of something and the faculty to present something We can conceive the infinitely great the infinitely powerful he explains but every presentation of an object destined to make visible this absolute greatness or power appears to lose the building us painfully inadequate Those are ideas of which no presentation is possible Therefore they impart no knowledge about reality experi ence18 The entire ethical stake of modern art for Lyotard then is to present the fact that the unpresentable exists To make visible that there is something which can be conceived and which can neither be seen nor made visible 78 But how to do this Here Lyotard follows Kants invocation of formlessness the absence of form as a possible index to the unpresentable as that which will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see it will please only by causing pain 78 The sublime then is a feeling that marks the incommensurability of reason conception and the singularity or particularity of the world and its objects presentation It is an incommensurability that carries ethical force for it serves as a reminder that the heterogeneity of the world cannot be reduced to a unified rule or reason And this incom pleteness in turn necessitates a permanent openness of any discourse to its other to what Lyotard elsewhere calls the differend19 Lyotards rendering of the Kantian sublime would seem to be use ful in approaching Blur and Kants invocation of formlessness as the sublimes index would seem doubly promising But its limitations may be marked by the fact that Kants sublime remains tethered to something on the order of a subject to use Foucaults famous phrasehence it remains referenced essentially to the language of phenomenology to the affective states of a subjectsupposedtoknow who in experienc ing her nonknowledge experiences pain and thus changes her relation to herself What I am suggesting then is that in Lyotards rendering of the sublimeand it would be far afield to argue the point in any more detail herethe price we pay for a certain deconstruction of the subject of humanism one that will be traced from Kant to Nietzsche in The Postmodern Condition20 is that the subject remains installed at the center of its universe only now its failure is understood be a kind of success Moreover that this failure is ethicalis the hook on which the ethical rehabilitation of the subject hangs in its forcible opening to the world of the object the differend and so onis the surest sign that we have not for all that left the universe of Kantian humanism We must remember that the ethical force of the sublime in Lyotards Kant de pends on the addressee of ethics being a member of the community of reasonable beings who must be equipped with the familiar humanist repertoire of language reason and so on to experience in the ethical imperative not a determinant synthesisnot onesizefitsall rules for the good and the just actbut an Idea of human society which is why Kant argues for example that we have no direct duties to non human animals21 This in turn reontologizes the subjectobject split that the discourse of the sublime was meant to call into question in the first place In contrast to this Diller  Scofidio insist that their work be understood in postmoral and postethical terms22 What this means I think is not that they intend their work to have no ethical or po litical resonancethat much is already obvious from their foregoing comments on Blurbut rather that they understand the relationship between art the subject and world in resolutely posthumanist terms That is to say in Diller  Scofidio the human and the non or anti or ahuman do not exist in fundamentally discrete ontological registers butquite the contraryinhabit the same postontological space in mutual relations of intrication and instability This boundary break down tends to be thematized in their broader body of work in the inter penetration of the human and the technological as in for example the multimedia theater work Jet Lag the VirtueVice Glasses series and the EJM 2 Inertia dance piece but it is also sometimes handled even more broadly in terms of the interweaving of the organic and the inorganic the natural and the artificial think here not only of Blur but also of projects like Slow House or The American Lawn Sometimes those unstable relations are funny sometimes they are frightening but al most always the signature affect in Diller  Scofidios work is radical ambivalencean ambivalence that in contrast to the sublime isnt about a clearcut pain that becomes in a second pedagogical moment pleasure but rather an ambivalence that is tied to the difficulty of knowing exactly what is being experienced as in works that intermesh real video surveillance with staged scenes for example in the Facsimile installation at Moscone Center in San Francisco or how we should feel about it think here of Jump Cuts or again Blurall of which leads in turn to the ultimate question namely Who is doing the experiencing Who in phenomenological and in political terms are we exactly In this light Diller  Scofidio like Lyotards Kant show us how ques tions of ethics are just that questions but they do so unlike Lyotards lose the building Kant without recontaining the force of that radical undecidability in terms of a humanist subject an alltoofamiliar wea reasonable being directed toward an idea of societyfor whom and only for whom those questions are What this suggests is that a move beyond an essentially human ist ontological theoretical framework is in order if we are to under stand the Blur project or indeed Diller  Scofidios work as a whole We need in other words to replace what questions with how questions to use Niklas Luhmanns shorthand23 Here recent work in systems theoryparticularly Luhmanns later workcan be of im mense help not least because it gives us a theoretical vocabulary for understanding the sorts of things that Diller  Scofidio have in mind when they suggest that in Blur our objective is to weave together ar chitecture and electronic technologies yet exchange the properties of each for the other Blur 44 The fundamental postulate of systems theoryits replacement of the familiar ontological dichotomies of hu manism culturenature and its cognates mindbody spiritmatter reasonfeeling and so on with the functional distinction system environmentis indispensable in allowing us to better understand the sorts of transcodings that Diller  Scofidio have in mind because it gives us a theoretical vocabulary that can range across what were in the humanist tradition ontologically separate categories Moreover systems theory allows us to explain not only how those transcodings are specific to particular systemshow art and architecture for ex ample integrate electronic technologies as artbut also how in being system specific they are paradoxically paradigmatic of and produce the very situation those systems attempt to respond to24 That situa tion of course is hypercomplexity created by what Luhmann calls the functional differentiation of modern society what other criti cal vocabularies would call its specialization or more moralistically fragmentation which only gets accentuated and accelerated under postmodernity25 For Luhmann the social system of artlike any other autopoietic system by definitionfinds itself in an environment that is always al ready more complex than itself and all systems as we know from our earlier discussions attempt to adapt to this complexity by filtering it in terms of their own selfreferential codes which are based on a funda mental distinction by means of which they carry out their operations The point of the system is to reproduce itself but no system can deal with everything or even many things all at oncehence the need for a code of selectivity As I noted in my earlier discussions of Luhmanns work two subsidiary points need to be accented here First responding to environmental complexity in terms of their own selfreferential codes is how subsystems build up their own internal complexity one might think here of the various subspecialties of the legal system say or the specialization of disciplines in the education system as I argued earlier in my discussion of disciplinarity in doing so systems become more finely grained in their selectivity and thus they buy time in relation to overwhelming environmental complexity and change As Luhmann puts it The systems inferiority in complexity compared to that of the environment must be counterbalanced by strategies of selection26 But if the selfreference of the systems code reduces the flow of envi ronmental complexity into the system it also increases its irritability and in a real sense its dependence on the environment As for this latter point it is worth noting again the complex and seemingly paradoxical fact that the autopoietic closure of a system whether social or biologicalis precisely what connects it to its envi ronment As Luhmann explains it The concept of a selfreferentially closed system does not contradict the systems openness to the environ ment Instead in the selfreferential mode of operation closure is a form of broadening possible environmental contacts closure increases by constituting elements more capable of being determined the complex ity of the environment that is possible for the system 37 This is why as Luhmann puts it in Art as a Social System autopoiesis and complexity are conceptual coordinates    Assuming that the systems autopoiesis is at work evolutionary thresholds can catapult the system to a level of higher complexityin the evolution of living organisms toward sexual reproduction independent mobility a central nervous system To an external observer this may resemble an increase in system differentiation or look like a higher degree of in dependence from environmental conditions Typically such evolutionary jumps simultaneously increase a systems sensitivity and irritability it is more easily disturbed by environmental conditions that for their part result from an increase in the systems own complexity Dependency lose the building and independence in a simple causal sense are therefore not invariant magnitudes in that more of one would imply less of the other Rather they vary according to a systems given level of complexity In systems that are successful in evolutionary terms more independence typically amounts to a greater dependency on the environment    But all of this can happen only on the basis of the systems operative closure27 The informationfilter metaphor invoked above is misleading however precisely for the reasons noted at the beginning of the chapter because systems interface with their environment in terms of and only in terms of their own constitutive distinctions and the selfreferential codes based on them the environment is not an ontological category but a functional one it is not an outside to the system that is given as such from which the system then differentiates itselfit is not in other words either nature or society in the traditional sensebut is rather always the outside of a specific inside All of this leads to a paradoxical situation that is central to Luhmanns work and central to understand ing Luhmanns reworking of problems inherited from both Hegel and Husserl what links the system to the worldwhat literally makes the world available to the systemis also what hides the world from the system what makes it unavailable Given my discussion of the sublime and the problem of representing the unrepresentable this should ring a bellbut a different bell as it turns out and this is a point I will exam ine in further detail in the next two chapters To understand just how different we need to remember a point emphasized from the beginning of this book that all systems carry out their operations and maintain their autopoiesis by deploying a constitutive distinction and a code based on it that in principle could be otherwise This means that there is a paradoxical identity between the two sides of the systems constitu tive distinction because the distinction between both sides is a product of only one side In the legal system for example the distinction be tween the two sides legalillegal is instantiated or reentered to use Luhmanns terminology on only one side of the distinction namely the legal But no system can acknowledge this paradoxical identity of differencewhich is also in another sense simply the contingencyof its own constitutive distinction and at the same time use that distinc tion to carry out its operations It must remain blind to the very para dox of the distinction that links it to its environment As we know from our earlier discussions that does not mean that this blind spot cannot be observed from the vantage of another systemit can and that is what we are doing right nowbut that secondorder observation will itself be based on its own blind spot thus formally reproducing a blindness that is formally the same but con tingently not the same as that of the firstorder system And here as I have suggested elsewhere we find Luhmanns fruitful reworking of the Hegelian problematic not the identity of identity and nonidentity as in Hegel but rather the nonidentity of identity and nonidentityand a productive nonidentity at that28 As Luhmann explains it in a passage I have cited more than once in these pages The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the connection with the reality of the external world is established by the blind spot of the cognitive operation Reality is what one does not perceive when one perceives it29 Or as he puts it in somewhat different terms the world is now conceived along the lines of a Husserlian metaphor as an unreachable horizon that retreats further with each operation without ever holding out the prospect of an outside30 The question thenand this is directly related to the problems raised by the topos of the sublimeis how to observe how the world observes itself how a marked space emerges via a constitutive dis tinction from the unmarked space how something becomes invisible when something else becomes visible Here we might seem far afield from addressing the Blur project but in fact Luhmann argues the generality of these questions allows one to determine more precisely what art can contribute to solving this paradox of the invisibilization that accompanies making something visible 91 In this way the prob lems that the discourse of the sublime attempts to address can be as similated to the more formally rigorous scheme of the difference be tween first and secondorder observation Any observation renders the world invisible in relation to its constitutive distinction and that invisibility must itself remain invisible to the observation that employs that distinctionwhich in turn can only be disclosed by another obser vation that will also necessarily be doubly blind in the same way 91 In this twofold sense Luhmann writes the notion of a final unityof an ultimate reality that cannot assume a form because it has no other sideis displaced into the unobservable    If the concept of the world lose the building is retained to indicate reality in its entirety then it is that whichto a secondorder observerremains invisible in the movements of obser vation his own and those of others 91 see also 29 This means not only that art can no longer be understood as an imitation of something that presumably exists along with and outside of art but more impor tantly for our purposes to the extent that imitation is still possible it now imitates the worlds invisibility a nature that can no longer be apprehended as a whole 92 The paradox unique to art which art creates and resolves Luhmann writes resides in the observability of the unobservable 149 And this is a question of form It is in these termsto return now to Diller  Scofidiothat we might best understand the uncanny effect of Blurs manufactured cloud hovering over a lake with the point being not that the cloud is not a cloud but rather that the lake is not a lake precisely in the sense that art can be said to imitate nature only because nature isnt nature an insight that is surely at work as well in Diller  Scofidios Slow House projectwhich is simply another way of saying that all ob servations including those of nature are contingent and of necessity blind to their own contingency To put it in a Deleuzian rather than Luhmannian register we might say that Blur virtualizes the very na ture it imitates but only paradoxically by concretizing that virtualiza tion in its formal decisionsan imitation of nature that formally ren ders the impossibility of an imitation of nature As Luhmann puts it in an analysis that is thematized as it were in the blurriness of Diller  Scofidios project and in the critical intent they attach to it Art makes visible possibilities of order that would otherwise remain invis ible It alters conditions of visibilityinvisibility in the world by keeping invisibility constant and making visibility subject to variation 96 And here I think we can bring into the sharpest possible focus if the metaphor can be allowed in this context the brilliance of the projects refusal of architecture and its strategy of focusing on the radicality of an absent building In this context one might say that the strength of Blurs formal intervention visàvis the medium of architecture is precisely its formlessness because it is calculated to bring into focus how the realm officially known as architecture to borrow Koolhaas and Maus phrase can no longer keep invisibility constant and make visibility subject to variation Official architecture invisibilizes the invisibility of the world precisely by being too visible too legible And in so doing as art it might as well be invisible Here we might recall Luhmanns suggestive comments about Christos wrapping of architectural structures In an earlier moment of the postmodern in architecture quotation of historical styles elements and the like attempts as Luhmann puts it in Art as a Social System to copy a differentiated and diverse environment into the artwork but this in turn only raises the further formal problem of whether and in what way the work can claim unity and whether it can assert itself against its own  requisite variety 29899 How Luhmann asks can the art system reflect upon its own differentiation not only in the form of theory but also in individual works of art Christos response to this problem he suggests is particularly striking if objects can no longer legitimize their boundaries and distinctions they must be wrapped 400n220 From this perspective we might think of Blur as Christo and JeanneClaude Wrapped Reichstag Berlin 197195 Photograph by Wolfgang Volz Copyright 1995 Christo lose the building a wrapped building with no building inside Or better yet as a wrapped building in which even the wrapping has too much form and begins to obsolesce the minute that form is concretized But what can it mean to say that an architectural project is con cerned primarily with having little enough form Hereand once again the otherwise daunting abstraction of systems theory is indispensable we need to understand that in no sense are we talking about objects sub stances materials or things when we use the term form Nor are we even for that matter talking about shape when we talk about form in Luhmanns sense The word formal here does not refer to the distinction which at first guided modern art between form and matter or form and content but to the characteristics of an indicating operation that observes as if from the corner of its eye what happens on the other side of form In this way the work of art points the observer toward an observation of form    It consists in demonstrating the compelling forces of order in the realm of the possible Arbitrariness is displaced beyond the boundaries of art into the unmarked space If    one transgresses this boundary and steps from the unmarked into the marked space things no longer happen randomly 148 In this way form stages the question of whether an observer can ob serve at all except with reference to an order 148 which is to say that it stages the inescapability of the fact that the world emerges only through observations employing distinctions and it stages the production of the unobservable the blind spot of observation that accompanies such observations 149 As Luhmann puts it rather un expectedly The world displays all the qualities that Nicholas of Cusa ascribed to God it is neither small nor large neither unity nor diver sity it neither has a beginning nor is it without beginningand this is why the world needs forms 15 From this vantage we can say then that the function of art is to make the world appear within the worldwith an eye toward the ambiva lent situation that every time something is made available for obser vation something else withdraws that in other words the activity of distinguishing and indicating that goes on in the world conceals the world    Yet a work of art is capable of symbolizing the reentry of the world into the world because it appearsjust like the worldincapable of emenda tion 149 italics mine With regard to this reentry two related points should be highlighted here to fully appreciate the specificity of Blurs formal innovations Firstand I have already touched on this in my discussion of Tree Cityform is in a profound sense a temporal problem if for no other reason than because of the contingency of any constitutive distinc tion Second formal decisions operate on two levels what we might call the internal and external they operate that is in relating the for mal decisions of the artwork itself to the larger system of art but also in relating the artwork as a whole to its larger environment of which the subsystem of art is only a part What is at stake operatively speaking in the production and observa tion of a work of art is always a temporal unity that is either no longer or not yet observed In this sense the artwork is the result of intrinsic form decisions and at the same time the metaform determined by these decisions which by virtue of its inner forms can be distinguished from the unmarked space of everything elsethe work as fully elabo rated object 72 Even more forcefully one might say that here we are dealing not with objects at all but rather with what systems theory sometimes calls eigenvalues or eigenbehaviors recursive distinctions that unfold and can only unfoldover time even as they can only be experienced in the fleeting moment of the present31 From this vantage objects appear as repeated indications which rather than having a specific opposite are demarcated against everything else In fact Luhmann suggests that we might follow Mead and Whitehead who assigned a function to identifiable and recognizable objects whose primary pur pose is to bind time This function is needed because the reality of experience and actions consists in mere event sequences that is in an ongoing selfdissolution32 These terms are remarkably apt for understanding how Blurs significance as a work of art under conditions of postmodernity goes far beyond the mere thematizations we can readily articulate which Diller  Scofidio themselves clearly reject Indeed in its unstable form shifting constantly in both shape and density of light and moisture lose the building this building that is not a building could well be described as epitomiz ing a temporal unity that is either no longer or not yet observed a something that is also to use Diller  Scofidios words a nothing In short a blur At the same time paradoxically as a metaform one could hardly imagine a more daring and original formal decision that dramatically distinguishes itself from the unmarked space of every thing else When we combine this understanding of the artwork as what Luhmann calls a quasiobject with attention to the double as pect of its formal decisions outlined earlier we can zero in on the fact that paradoxically the shapelessness of the Blur building is precisely what constitutes its most decisive and binding formal qualityand not least of course with regard to adjacent formal decisions in the realm of architecture Its refusal of architecture and its demateriali zation of the architectural medium paradoxically epitomize the ques tion of architectural form from a Luhmannian perspective that is the shapeshifting loosely defined space of Blur only dramatizes what is true of all architectural forms As the shifting winds over the Lake of Neuchâtel blow the cloud this way and that the joke is not on Blur but rather on any architectural forms that think they are solid real objectsthat have one might say a compositional rather than sys tematic understanding of the medium In this light one is tempted to read those moments when the winds swept nearly all the cloud away to reveal the underlying tensegrity structureleaving as one reviewer put it the view of an unfinished building awaiting its skin33as the most instructive all insofar as the building official architecture is revealed to be precisely not the building As we have already noted the effectiveness of these formal deci sions is only enhanced by the fact that they are smuggled inside the Trojan horse of the works savvy play with the art imitates nature theme From a systems theory point of view we might say that the joke here is not on those who think that art imitates nature but on those who think it doesntnot in the sense of an imitation of some thing that presumably exists along with and outside of art but in the sense that it now imitates the worlds invisibility a nature that can no longer be apprehended as a whole34 Another name for this fact as we have already noted is contingencynamely the contingency of the distinctions and indications that make the world available and because they are contingent simultaneously make it unavailable It is against that contingency that the artwork and its formal decisions assert them selves Luhmann writes All forms especially forms of art must per sist against the challenge that they could be different They convince by evoking alternative possibilities while neutralizing any preference for forms not chosen 92 The genius of Blur from this vantage is that it submits itself to this contingency in the vagaries and malleability of its shape its loose binding of time to recall Whitehead and Meads definition of objects while simultaneously taking it into account but as it were preemptively within its own frame as an indicating op eration that observes as if from the corner of its eye what happens on the other side of form 148 In doing so it employs constraints for the sake of increasing the works freedom in disposing over other constraints and this includes those contingencies that rather than threatening the work with obsolescence now increase the resonance of the work with its environment with all that it is not since those contingencies are now seen to be always already anticipated by the works noncontingent formal decision itself Of course all of this raises the question of what exactly is art if the formlessness of the object is being equated with the strength of its formal statement if the strongest form of something turns out to be nothing Here however we need only remind ourselves that questions of form are not questions of objects indeed if we fol low Whitehead Mead and systems theory even objects are not ques tions of objects And if thats the case then perhaps we are better off rephrasing the question along the following lines What is the rela tionship between discourse about art and the art object itself  On this point we would do well Luhmann rightly suggests to remember the lessons of Duchamp Cage and conceptual art in general35 One can ask how an art object distinguishes itself from other natural or artifi cial objects for example from a urinal or a snow shovel Luhmann writes Marcel Duchamp used the form of a work of art to impress this question on his audience and in a laudable effort eliminated all sensu ously recognizable differences between the two But can a work of art at once pose and answer this question36 The answer as it turns out is no because the meaning of Duchamps snow shovelthe significance of its firstorder formal decisionsdepends on and anticipates and lose the building manipulates a secondorder discourse of art criticism and theory in terms of which those firstorder decisions are received The firstorder observer need only identify a work of art as an object in contradistinc tion to all other objects or processes But for those who experience the work and want to understand its significance the situation is quite different Here the project of Cage and Duchamp is to confront the observer with the question of how he goes about identifying a work of art as a work of art The only possible answer is by observing observa tions 71 The observer uses a distinction to indicate what he observes This hap pens when it happens But if one wants to observe whether and how this happens employing a distinction is not enoughone must also indicate the distinction The concept of form serves this purpose    Whoever observes forms observes other observers in the rigorous sense that he is not interested in the materiality expectations or ut terances of these observers but strictly and exclusively in their use of distinctions 6667 Luhmann argues in fact that art and art criticism have been struggling with this issue at least since the early modern period In the convention of the still life for example which assumes great impor tance in Italian and Dutch painting we are presented with unworthy objects that could acquire meaning only by presenting the art of pre sentation itself focusing our attention on the blatant discrepancy between the banality of the subject matter and its artful presentation 69a process that is only further distilled in Duchamps snow shovel Indeed part of the genius of Duchamps work is that it reveals how the formula of disinterested pleasure fails to clarify what can be meant by artful presentation as an end in itself which only begs the ques tion that there is perhaps a special interest in being disinterested and can we assume that such an interest also motivates the artist who pro duces the work and who can neither preclude nor deny an interest in the interests of others 69 For Luhmann such questions index the situation of art as a social system under functionally differentiated mo dernity of art struggling to come to terms with its raison dêtrein systems theory terms to achieve and justify its operational closure or autonomy To create a work of art under these sociohistorical con ditions then amounts to creating specific forms for an observation of observations This is the sole purpose for which the work is pro duced From this perspective the artwork accomplishes the structural coupling between first and secondorder observations in the realm of art    The artist accomplishes this by clarifyingvia his own obser vations of the emerging workhow he and others will observe the work 69 Such an understanding is well and good but it would seem to leave wholly to the side the question of the experience of art as a percep tual and phenomenological eventsomething that would appear to be rather spectacularly foregrounded in Blur as Mark Hansen has recently argued and foregrounded moreover quite selfconsciously in terms of the function of spectacle in the tradition of the international expo as a genre a matter emphasized in Dillers lectures about the project at Princeton and elsewhere37 Indeed one might well argue that this and not the coupling of first and secondorder observations by means of form is what motivates contemporary art its experimentation with different media and so ona rule that is only proved so the argument would unfold by the exception of conceptual art Yet here we find one of the more original and innovative aspects of Luhmanns theory of art as a social system Luhmanns point is not to deny the phenomenologi cal aspect of the artwork but to point outwhich seems rather obvious upon reflectionthat the meaning of the artwork cannot be referenced to much less reduced to this material and perceptual aspect Rather the work of art copresents perception and communicationand does so in a way that turns out to be decisive for what another theoretical vocabulary might call arts critical function in relation to society To understand how this happens we need to revisit one of the central points of the opening chapter that for Luhmann perception and beyond that consciousness and communication operate in mutu ally exclusive operationally closed autopoietic systems though they are structurally coupled through media such as language As Luhmann puts it in a formulation surely calculated to provoke Humans can not communicate not even their brains can communicate not even their conscious minds can communicate Only communication can communicate38 Communication operates with an unspecific refer ence to the participating state of mind he continues it is especially lose the building unspecific as to perception It cannot copy states of mind cannot imitate them cannot represent them39 At the same time however consciousness and perception are a medium for communication On the one hand unperceived communications do not exist if they did how would we know communication Luhmann writes can hardly come into being without the participation of the mind and in this sense the relationship is asymmetrical 374 On the other hand communication uses the mind as a medium precisely because com munication does not thematize the mind in question Metaphorically speaking the mind in question remains invisible to communication 378 The mind is of necessity its own operationally closed biological system but because it is also a necessary medium for communication we can say that the mind has the privileged position of being able to disturb stimulate and irritate communication 379 It cannot in struct or direct communicationsreports of perceptions are not per ceptions themselvesbut it can stimulate communication without ever becoming communication 37980 For several reasons the irreducibility of perception to commu nication and vice versa and their asymmetrical relationship is crucial to what a different theoretical vocabulary would call arts critical function First as Dietrich Schwanitz munication to put it in Derridean terms differs defers and temporal izes In the work of art the difference between perception and commu nication is reentered in the services of the works communication But because of this asymmetry in speeds it is reentered in a way that calls attention to the contingency of communicationnot of the firstorder communication of the artwork which appears incapable of emenda tion it is what it is but of the secondorder observation of the works meaning and its critical function visàvis the system of art This can be accomplished as in Blur by making perception outrun communica tion as it were a process well described by Hansen the better to pro voke a question that the work itself is made to answer Or conversely in a work like On Kawaras Date Paintings it can be accomplished by using the deficit of perceptual depth or complexity in the paintings themselves to call attention to the difference between the works im mediate perceptual surface and its larger meaning41 Thus the artwork copresents the difference between perception and communication and this difference is what allows art to have something like a privileged relationship to what is commonly invoked as the ineffable or the incommunicable and it uses perception to irritate and stimulate communication to respond to the question what does this perceptual event mean As Luhmann puts it in a key passage for understanding his theory of art The function of art would then consist in integrating what is in prin ciple incommunicablenamely perceptioninto the communication network of society    The art system concedes to the perceiving con sciousness its own unique adventure in observing artworksand yet makes available as communication the formal selection that triggered the adventure Unlike verbal communication which all too quickly moves toward a yesno bifurcation communication guided by percep tion relaxes the structural coupling of consciousness and communica tion without destroying it of course    In a manner that is matched neither by thought nor by communication perception presents aston ishment and recognition in a single instant Art uses enhances and in a sense exploits the possibilities of perception in such a way that it can present the unity of this distinction    The pleasure of astonishment already described in antiquity refers to the unity of the difference be tween astonishment and recognition to the paradox that both intensify one another42 lose the building And Luhmann addsin an observation directly relevant to Blurs auda cious formal solution to the problem of architectureExtravagant forms play an increasingly important role in this process 141 This is not however simply a matter of pleasure or aesthesis In fact it is what gives art something like a privileged critical rela tionship to society because art establishes a reality of its own that differs from ordinary reality Despite the works perceptibility de spite its undeniable reality Luhmann writes it simultaneously con stitutes another reality    Art splits the world into a real world and an imaginary world and the function of art concerns the meaning of this split 142 By virtue of its unique relationship to the difference between perception and communication art can raise this question in an especially powerful way not available to other social systems If we think of objects themselves as eigenbehaviors to seize once again on Heinz von Foersters term as stabilizations of various durations made possible by the repeated recursive application of particular dis tinctions then we might observe that the objects that emerge from the recursive selfapplication of communicationversus say rocks or treescontribute more than any other kinds of norms and sanctions to supplying the social system with necessary redundancies they literally fix social space This is probably even more true Luhmann observes of such quasiobjects to use Michel Serress phrase that have been invented for the sake of this specific function such as kings or soccer balls Such quasiobjects can be comprehended only in rela tion to this functionindeed it is their sole reason for being Works of art Luhmann continues are quasiobjects in this sense They individualize themselves by ex cluding the sum total of everything else not because they are con strued as given but because their significance as objects implies a realm of social regulation One must scrutinize works of art as intensely and with as close attention to the object as one does when watching kings and soccer balls in this wayand in the more complex case where one observes other observers by focusing on the same objectthe socially regulative reveals itself 47 When we remember that for Luhmann this more complex case is represented nowhere more clearly than in our experience of the mass media the relationship between Blurs formal decisions as a work of art and its critical agenda of shedding light on the socially regulativeon the terrain of an international media expo no lesscomes even more forcefully into view In these terms works of art in calling our atten tion to the realm of the socially regulative cast light on precisely those contingencies constructions and norms that the mass media in their own specific mode of communication occlude In the first in stance the artwork we seem to be dealing with completely ad hoc constructed objects whose realm of reference is not the real world at all but that of the imagination In the second we appear to be dealing with the opposite in which the representations of the mass media are motivated by the objects and facts of the real world In fact however this thematization in terms of imaginative and real only obscures the need to rearticulate the relationship in terms of the dynamics of first and secondorder observation of different social systems As Luhmann points out the mass media create the illusion that we are firstorder observers whereas in fact this is already secondorder ob serving43 or more baldly still put in Kantian terms the mass media generate a transcendental illusion44 The mass medias rendering of reality howeverand this is a point that the postethical character of Diller  Scofidios work insists on in a highly specific wayis not to be taken as most people would be inclined to think as a distortion of reality It is a construction of reality For from the point of view of a postontological theory of observing systems there is no distinct real ity out there who then would make these distinctions    There is no transcendental subject We have to rely on the system of the mass media that construct our reality    If there is no choice in accepting these observations because there is no equally powerful alternative available we have at least the possibility to deconstruct the presenta tions of the mass media their presentations of the present45 That deconstruction of the mass media in Blur proceeds by means of the artworks secondorder observation of the firstorder system of the mass media but that observation in turn only happens by art doing what it does as its own firstorder system with its own code its own blind spot That formal symmetry between the two observ ing systems howeverthe fact that the dynamics of communica tion in autopoietic social systems operate in the same ways in each lose the building system on the basis of paradoxical selfreference constitutive blindness to the unity of the systems core distinction and so ononly throws into critical relief the difference in the relationship of communication and perception and in the case at hand specifically visual perception that is specific to each system And Blur will put that difference to critical use under the thematization of spectacle We can gain a sharper sense of just how this is the case when we recall that for Luhmann electronic mass media are just the latest in a series of powerful developments in the history of what he calls media of dissemination beginning with lan guage and then crucially the invention of writing and printing whose power lies in their ability to make communication independent from a specific perceptual substrate or set of coordinates Alphabetized writ ing made it possible to carry communication beyond the temporally and spatially limited circle of those who were present at any particular time he writes and language per seand even more so writing and printingincreases the understandability of communication beyond the sphere of perception46 Unlike oral speech which can compensate for lack of information with persuasion and can synchronize speaking hearing and accepting in a rhythmic and rhapsodic way leaving literally no time for doubt 162 writing and printing enforce an experience of the difference that constitutes communicationnamely the difference between communication and perceptionand they are in this precise sense more communicative forms of communication 163 For Luhmann the electronic mass media represent the culmina tion of this general line of historical development Indeed for the differ entiation of a system of the mass media the decisive achievement can be said to have been the invention of technologies of dissemination which not only circumvent interaction among those copresent but effectively render such interaction impossible for the mass medias own commu nications47 This process began with the advent of the printing press when the volume of written material multiplied to the extent that oral interaction among all participants in communication is effectively and visibly rendered impossible 16 And so it is Luhmann argues that in the wake of the socalled democratization of politics and its depen dence on the media of public opinion    those participating in politics politicians and voters alikeobserve one another in the mirror of pub lic opinion    The level of firstorder observation is guaranteed by the continuous reports of the mass media    Secondorder observation occurs via the inferences one can draw about oneself or others if one assumes that those who wish to participate politically encounter one another in the mirror of public opinion and that this is sufficient48 It is just this situation that Blur attempts to address if we believe Diller  Scofidionamely by subjecting communication in its mass mediated mode as something immediately legible and consumable to a perceptual blur so that spectacle operates here not in the service of imme diately meaningful prefab ideological content as in the electronic mass media but rather as the unavoidable provocation to another communica tion whose meaning is far from immediately clear and in being so oper ates directly in the services of arts own communication and autopoiesis ie what does this mean is this art In this way Diller  Scofidios project might be understood as bringing into focus 1 how the contin gency of communication is managed and manipulated by the socially regulative in the electronic mass media and 2 how that dynamic in turn is coupled to a certain consumerist schematization of visuality in which the difference between perception and communication is always already reentered in massmediated communication to produce a pre digested iconographic visual space readily incorporated by a subject whose unethical relation to the visual might best be summed up as click here We might say then that Blur uses the difference between perception and communication in a way diametrically opposed to what we find in the electronic mass media and then routes that difference be tween art and the mass media through the works formal choices to ren der them specifically meaningful as art not just as wellmeaning critical platitude What is remarkable here of course is not that Blur makes this somewhat unremarkable observation about the relationship of percep tion and communication in electronic mass media a relationship par ticularly evident in the realm of visuality What is remarkable is that Blur does so without saying so by insisting only on itself This is simply to say that Blur communicates this difference as art And if it didnt we wouldnt pay any attention to it Emersons Romanticism Cavells Skepticism Luhmanns Modernity If Emersons representativeness his universalizing is not to go unexamined neither should his habitually condemned individualism If he is to be taken as an instance of human ism    then he is at the same time to be taken as some form of antihumanist working against ourselves against what we understand as human understanding stanley cavell Emersons Constitutional Amending Reading Fate Reality is what one does not perceive when one perceives it niklas luhmann The Cognitive Program of Constructivism and a Reality That Remains Unknown As a mode of cultural practice Emersons romanticism has often been taken as an especially outlandishthat is to say an espe cially incoherentengagement of the central themes associated with the romantic problematic the sublime imagination etc that we have been attempting so far to rescript in these pages the better to disclose their essential rigor and systematicity a rigor and systematicity that is achieved because of not in spite of the unwillingness to turn away from the paradoxical forms of observation and selfreference that sys tems theory but also in its way deconstruction enables us to theorize with some depth and precision This charge arises against Emerson be cause of the insistent strangeness the unremittingly heretical quality of his writing in which a signature feature is to take precisely the turn of thought or phrase that seems to undermine at a stroke the entire argu ment just made a seemingly relentless drive to pursue thought wherever it may lead even into paradox and conceptual meltdown As Emersons writes in SelfReliance in an altogether characteristic gesture Speak emer sons romanticism what you think now in hard words and tomorrow speak what to morrow thinks in hard words again though it contradict every thing you said today1 As the philosopher Stanley Cavell has noted Along with the gesture of denying philosophy to Emerson goes another al most as common    namely that of describing Emersons prose as a kind of mist or fog as if it is generally quite palpable what it is that Emerson is obscurely reaching for words to say and generally quite pat ent that the ones he finds are more or less arbitrary and conventional    as though he cannot mean anew in every word he says2 For Cavell the power of the Emersonian project begins with the rigor of its confrontation with the inescapability and consequences of philosophical skepticism the fact as Cavell puts it that the world ex ists as it were for its own reasons3 Emerson both acknowledges bears or suffers will be a better term eventuallyand resists what Cavell calls the most famous settlement with the problem of skepti cism in the philosophical tradition namely Kants in The Critique of Pure Reason As Cavell summarizes it The dissatisfaction with such a settlement as Kants is relatively easy to state To settle with skepticism    to assure us that we do know the existence of the world or rather that what we understand as knowl edge is of the world the price Kant asks us to pay is to cede any claim to know the thing in itself to grant that human knowledge is not of things as they are in themselves You dontdo youhave to be a romantic to feel sometimes about that settlement Thanks for nothing4 The irony of the Kantian settlement with skepticismand it is an irony that will in no small part structure what Cavell characterizes as noth ing less than Emersons reinvention of philosophyis that if reason proves its power to itself over itself by discovering the difference between the mere appearances of which it can have knowledge and the Ding an sich of which it cannot5 then the triumph of philosophy is also at the same time its failure a final failure as it turns out because knowledge secures itself only by losing the world leaving us locked to borrow Emersons phrase in Experience in a prison of glass6 As Emerson puts it in a famous passage from Experience that Cavell returns to time and again I take this evanescence and lubricity of all objects which lets them slip through our fingers then when we clutch hardest to be the most unhandsome part of our condition 200 emer sons romanticism What this demands from philosophy then is a double gesture in the recognition that thinking must henceforward proceed differently First Emerson comes to understandas Cavell brilliantly and even movingly demonstratesthat philosophy has to do with the per plexed capacity to mourn the passing of the world7 In Experience that mourning is figured in some of the most shocking and vertiginous lines in all of American literature where reflecting on the grief attend ing the death of his son two years earlier Emerson writes I cannot get it nearer to me it does not touch me Emerson grieves Cavell suggests not so much over the death of his son but over the loss of the world with which even the experience of grief cannot bring him into closer contact I grieve that grief can teach me nothing Grief too Emerson writes will make us idealists8 Second if the demand for foundational concepts abstract synthesis and unity of judgments only drives the world away from us in the very act of trying to grasp and apprehend it then thinking must be reconceived as what Cavell calls clutchings opposite9 Philosophy to put it telegraphically must get out of hand which is exactly what happens in Emersons reinvention of philosophy as antiphilosophyhence the demanding wildness of Emersons writing which will lead the attentive reader to ask more than once Is he serious Emerson thus inaugurates a rethinking of thinking that will even tually lead as Cavell points out to Heideggers assertion that thinking is a handicraft but a handicraft carried out in respect of the deriva tion of the word thinking from a root for thanking    as giving thanks for the gift of thinking10 And eventuallyas Cavell does not point outit will lead not only to Derridas analysis of the gift but also to his critique of Heideggers humanism in relation to the question of spe cies difference in the essay Geschlecht II Heideggers Hand11 There Derrida deconstructs the purity of the distinction between giving and taking that Heideggers humanism takes we might even say holds for granteda deconstruction that one might well argue is writ large in Emersons essay Fate where he insists See how fate slides into free dom and freedom into fate observe how far the roots of every creature run or find if you can a point where there is no thread of connection 273 Thinking with Emerson then becomes not active apprehension prehensile grasping of the world by our concepts as it were but an emer sons romanticism act of reception a reception in which passivitybecause it consists of a capacity to be affected by the world in manifold ways that cannot be contained by the choked bottleneck of thought as philosophy has tradi tionally conceived itbecomes paradoxically a maximally active pas sivity This process is everywhere testified to in Emersons work from beginning to end from the Transparent Eyeball passage in Nature to the seemingly paradoxical assertion in SelfReliance that self reliance is Godreliance to his assertion in Experience that all I know is reception I am and I have but I do not get and when I fancied I had gotten anything I found I did not    When I receive a new gift I do not macerate my body to make the account square for if I should die I could not make the account square The benefit overran the merit the first day 212 But as crucial as Cavells work has been for enabling a new and deeply compelling understanding of Emerson and his relationship to Continental philosophy I want to suggest that a more rigorous and historically compelling understanding of Emersons work is available to us if we reframe Cavells account itself within a more comprehen sive view of Emersons romanticism as a response to the condition of modernity and its epistemological and ethical fallouta phenomenon marked in Cavells reading by the broad brushstroke of skepticism In this connection it is surprising as Paul Jay has pointed out that Emersons work as a response specifically to modernity has not re ceived more attention as debates have instead been preoccupied with arguments in the 1980s and 1990s over whether Emerson is best under stood as a transcendentalist or a pragmatist or more recently with the political status of Emersons workbut political understood it turns out in a quite ideologically specific way12 And even in more re cent studies where the context of modernity does seem to be cultivated for understanding Emersons work for example in Jay Grossmans Reconstituting the American Renaissance which revisits Emerson in the context of a specifically American version of the long eighteenth century the conjugation remains hampered by a certain American exceptionalismone replete with a familiar set of assumptions about what politics is how it is related to questions of ethics and agency how individuals are related to social institutions and so onthat has been endemic to American studies and its core theoretical and methodologi emer sons romanticism cal commitments as numerous commentators have noted almost since the inception of the discipline itself13 Those assumptions and commitments I would argue are consti tuted by and reproduce an ideologically specific form of liberal human ism But as one of its critics Donald Pease has recently pointed out What Emerson referred to as my genius when it calls me achieved effects that were independent of the processes of identification inter pellation and internalization associated with liberal institutions and it thus also undermined liberalisms conception of the possessive indi vidual as its subject14 To put it bluntly the liberal humanist assump tions taken for granted in most American studies critiques of Emerson are not just tangentially but directly under assault in Emersons work So it should come as no surprise that we often find the assumption in American studies work on Emerson that to abandon those very ideas about politics agency and so on is to be more or less by default politi cally conservative or regressive which is after all the way ideology works through institutions like academia to reproduce itself  Though I cannot pursue the argument in any detail here I would suggest particularly in the current geopolitical moment which can only be called a moment of crisis for liberal democracy and its ideology and institutionsthat we would be better off taking seriously Emersons interrogation of liberalisms assumptions about subjectivity agency and politics even if those queries end as they often do in Emerson in anything but a sanguine view of our situation We should take heed of them for the same reasons that have generated such an upsurge in interest in figures such as Giorgio Agamben and Carl Schmitt Indeed what Chantal Mouffe writes about Schmitt could well serve as a para phrase of Cavells reading of Emersons late essay Fate and its im plications for politics As Mouffe puts it The political cannot be re stricted to a certain type of institution or envisioned as constituting a specific sphere or level of society It must be conceived as a dimension that is inherent to every human society and that determines our very ontological condition15 We may now return with a somewhat different set of coordi nates and a different sense of their implications to the question of mo dernity whose chief philosophical challenge as Jay points out is the wellknown process of secularization It is this challenge to which emer sons romanticism romanticism so the story goes constitutes a finally flawed and even fanciful response one whose contours we have already glimpsed in the fundamentally ironic structure of the Kantian transcendentalism and its settlement with skepticism For Habermas in The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity secularization means that thought can and will no longer borrow the criteria by which it takes its orientation from models supplied by another epoch it has to create its normativity out of itself for Foucaultand here we return to Kant once moreit is that thought must put its own reason to use without subjecting it self to any authority16 If the upside of the philosophical situation of modernity is as Jay puts it that the present represents an exit or a way out of subordination to traditional emer sons romanticism representationalist mode of philosophical practice As Rorty explains it the problem with philosophical representationalism is the assumption that making true and representing are reciprocal relations as if the nonlinguistic item which makes S true is the one represented by S18 For philosophical idealism that item will be something in the changeless character of the subject for realism it will be something in the nature of the object that has a context of its own a context which is privileged by virtue of being the objects rather than the inquir ers 96 In either case what representationalism fails to see is that determinacy is not what is in questionthat neither does thought determine reality nor in the sense intended by the realist does real ity determine thought 5 Both positions as Cavell might say find themselves unduly even preeningly handsomehence the strange insistent movement of Emersons prose which takes for granted as it were Rortys contention that words take their meaning from other words rather than by virtue of their representative character and their transparency to the real19 that grasping the thing itself is not something that precedes contextualization20 For these reasons as Rorty has lucidly explained leveling the charge of relativism at antirepresentationalism is an empty gesture Relativism certainly is selfrefuting he writes but there is a differ ence between saying that every community is as good as every other and saying that we have to work out from the networks where we are The idea he continues that every tradition or belief or idea or community is as rational or as moral as every other could be held only by a god    Such a being would have escaped from history and conver sation into contemplation and metanarrative To accuse postmodern ism of relativism is to try to put a metanarrative in the postmodernists mouth 202 It is precisely this kind of embeddedness of course that is everywhere under intense scrutiny in essays of Emersons such as Fate And soto return now to Cavellto take the unsolvability of skepticism to heart is not just at the same stroke to abandon the rep resentationalist philosophical project it is also to change our view of the relationship of thinking and language that I have already discussed in some detail in the first half of this book What Kant confronted as merely a problem of thought Emerson grappled with under the additional rigors of writing and languageof philosophy as a writing emer sons romanticism practiceso that the stipulations or terms under which we can say anything at all to one another will themselves be subjected to endless and endlessly unfinalized scrutiny21 As Cavell puts it in Emerson I find the Critique of Pure Reason turned upon itself notions of limitation and of condition are as determining in the essay Fate as they are in Kant but it is as if these terms are themselves subjected to transcenden tal deduction as if not just twelve categories but any and every word in our language stands under the necessity of deduction or say deriva tion    Emerson is commonly felt to play fast and loose with some thing like contradiction in his writing but I am speaking of a sense in which contradiction the countering of diction is the genesis of his writing of philosophy 113 What this means is that when we come upon such apparently full bore idealist statements in Emerson as the following from the essay FateIntellect annuls fate So far as a man thinks he is freethis apparently genteel thought Cavell writes now turns out to mean that    our antagonism to fate to which we are fated and in which our freedom resides is as a struggle with the language we emit of our character with itself22 One striking example of this new philosophical practice that Cavell finds in Emersonthis time in relation not to Kant but to Descartesoccurs in SelfReliance when Emerson writes Man is timid and apologetic he is no longer upright he dares not say I think I am but quotes some saint or sage If the central feature of the Cartesian subject is as Cavell writes that the discovery that my existence requires hence permits proof you might say authen tication    requires that if I am to exist I must name my existence acknowledge it then the real rigor of Emersons confrontation with these terms is that it goes the whole way with Descartes insight It insists on the proof of selfhoodincluding its proof in and through the terms of thinkingwithout providing a fixed a priori subject on which such a proof could rely and of which it could be as it were the representationas if there were nothing to rely on Cavell writes but reliance itself23 The beauty of Emersons answer to Descartes Cavell writes emer sons romanticism lies in its weakness you may say in its emptinessindeed in two weaknesses First it does not prejudge what the I or self or mind or soul may turn out to be but only specifies a condition that whatever it is must meet Second the proof only works in the moment of its giving for what I prove is the existence only of a creature who can enact its existence as exemplified in actually giving the proof not one who at all time does in fact enact it 87 The self of Emersonian selfreliance then is not a state of being but a moment of change say of becominga transience of being a being of transience 89 In Cavelland this marks precisely his difference with Rorty the paradoxical selfreference of the proof of the Emersonian self is crucial to what we might think of as its generative incompleteness This movement of the Emersonian selfin which the self might be said to be alive only to the extent that it is movingis crucial to what Cavell sees as the political import of Emersons work what he calls its democratic or moral perfectionism As Cavell describes it I do not read Emerson as saying    that there is one unattainedattainable self we repetitively never arrive at but rather that having a self is a process of moving to and from nexts    That the self is always at tained as well as to be attained creates the problem in Emersons con cept of selfreliance    that unless you manage the reliance of the at tained on the unattainedattainable that is unless you side that way you are left in precisely the negation of the position he calls for left in conformity24 In its onwardness the Emersonian self must con stantly surpass the selves it has already become but not to attain an ideal fixed selfhood And yet since the task for each is his or her own selftransformation Cavell sensibly observes the representativeness implied in that life may seem not to establish a recognition of others in different positions so as to be disqualified as a moral position al together Emersons remarkable twist on this problem however is that his writing works out the conditions for my recognizing my differ ence from others as a function of my recognizing my difference from myself 25 after all strictly speaking only you can transform you and only I can transform me So Emersons turn is to make my partiality itselfwhat I am here calling somewhat at a tangent to Cavell as will become clear my contingencythe sign and incentive of my emer sons romanticism siding with the next or future self which means siding against my at tained perfection or conformity sidings which require the recogni tion of an otherthe acknowledgement of a relationshipin which this sign is manifest26 Emersonian perfectionism may thus be conceived as a kind of ongoing act of radical negative capability that provides the foundation though that is eventually not the word we would want of course for democratic relations with others with those other selves I have not yet been but who alsoand this is the engine of Emersons constant polemical projectneed to surpass themselves in an ongoing process of democracy conceived as otherness always yet to be achieved or if already achieved only achieved in the present by the other and not by me As difficult as it is to see Cavell is right that this idea of perfection ism is projected in contrast to the idea of ones own nature27 and all of Emersons talkand a considerable amount of talk it isof self recovery both early and late in his work directs us to not an originary fixed selfsubstance but toward a power and a process not toward the past but toward the future or rather toward futurity itself conceived as a horizon where paradoxically the only self to recover is a self that one has not yet been for the self only exists in its becoming28 Indeed from this vantage we might read recovery very differently as a recovering as burying and covering over once more the past self that casualty of what Cavell calls Emersons onwardness It is in the context and the services of these future selves and against what Emerson calls conformity that we are to understand the political involvement of the Emersonian self in the sense insisted on at the end of Experience where Emerson writes that the true ro mance which the world exists to realize will be the transformation of genius into practical power 213 As Cavell writes when Emersons critics read the line selfreliance is the aversion of conformity they take this to mean roughly that he is disgusted with society and wants no more to do with it29 But if we understand the Emersonian self as movement toward futurity and not a being then instead of conversion to a truth we already know and to a being we already are aversion means that his writing and his society incessantly recoil from or turn away from one another but since this is incessant the picture is at the same time of each incessantly turning toward the other30 This process emer sons romanticism is dramatized perhaps nowhere more forcefully than in late essays and addresses like Fate and The Fugitive Slave Law where Emerson insists time and again on turning away from society and its institu tions toward the domain of justice and ethics only to turn back to the realization of freedom not in transcendence but in practical power31 On the one hand Emerson asserts in The Fugitive Slave Law No forms neither constitutions nor laws nor covenants nor churches nor bibles are of any use in themselves The Devil nestles comfortably into them all There is no help but in the head and heart and hamstrings of a man32 On the other hand as Emerson writes in Fate A man must thank his defects and stand in some terror of his talents A tran scendent talent draws so largely on his forces as to lame him a defect pays him revenues on the other side 273 and he reminds us that his power is hooped in by a necessity which by many experiments he touches on every side until he learns its arc 268 A corollary of this aversive movement of the Emersonian self is that the worldand we already know this from the Kantian anatomy of skepticismalways al ready vanishes from me as Cavell puts it becomes a horizon that we can only approach but never reach one that in a radical sense depends on the terms we use not to apprehend it but to receive or as Cavell puts it acknowledge it just as I am impelled toward the other by my par tiality toward myself my contingency Here we can begin to get a sense of the usefulness of Niklas Luhmanns work for helping us to read the full letter of Emersons think ing First of all Luhmanns theorization of these questions is more ana lytically precise than Cavells which remains largely at the level of a philosophical thematics characterized by what one might callat least from a Luhmannian point of viewan excessive literariness That would be of less moment were it not for the fact identified by Cavell that literariness has typically been used as a kind of code for dis missing Emersons rigor and philosophical seriousness Secondand this is clearer in light of RortyCavells reading of Emerson under the master rubric of skepticism remains tied one might argue to the rep resentationalism he would otherwise seem to disown because skepti cism holds on to the desire for a representational adequation between concepts and objects even as it knows that desire to be unappeasable how else are we to understand Cavells insistence on taking seriously emer sons romanticism the mourning of the loss of the worldand not of the child Waldo as Sharon Cameron insists in her classic essay Representing Griefin Emersons Experience Third most important of all Luhmann puts acute pressure on the relentlessly paradoxical and confounding dynamics of observation that are so central and so increasingly vexing in Emersons work dynamics that are usually thematized in criticism of romanticism under the rubric of imagination and more specifically in Emersons work in his wellknown theatrics with the trope of vision as in the famous Transparent Eyeball passage in the opening pages of Nature I am nothing I see all 29 In fact if we believe Maurice Gonnaud it is Emersons movement away from such solutions to the paradoxes of observation in the early 1840s that has made his later work in lec tures and essays such as The Method of Nature and Nominalist and Realist all the more confounding for his critics After 1840 Gonnaud writes If the Romantic was dead the optimist had survived him and was ready to make a virtue of necessityspecifically I will argue in a moment a necessity called contingency33 Although he continued to call himself an idealist Gonnaud continues he had ceased to be one in Kants sense or even in Coleridges The universe gradually comes to resemble that old TwoFace creatorcreature mindmatter right wrong which he was to evoke in Nominalist and Realist 301 Emersons insistence on the contingency not transcendence of observationwhat Gonnaud calls his effort to fling out a new bridgeless ethereal less harmonious perhaps but tougherbetween the One and the Many purchased by taking it upon himself to be the champion of the acknowledged facts honored in their richness and diversity 299 led to Emerson being even less understood than he had before 1840 Remarking on The Method of Nature Gonnaud writes that his listeners confessed to understanding very little of it the word ecstasy recurs like a leitmotif applied now to Nature and now to human beings and thus compounding the confusion 301 not just for Emersons contemporaries but even for later critics such as Stephen Whicher who finds that such work incorporates two irrec oncilable perspectives and suffers from a profound incoherence 302 What I want to suggest howeverand we will need Luhmanns work to fully explain whyis that it is precisely at these moments that we emer sons romanticism find Emerson at his most rigorous systematically extrapolating in his later work the paradoxical dynamics and consequences of observation that were as both Gonnaud and Cavell rightly observe in their differ ent ways certainly central to the Emersonian corpus from the begin ning but were papered over by the more conventional idealism and romanticism we find in essays such as Nature While Gonnaud regrets in the post1840 Emerson the authors centrifugal disposition of mind which keeps him from transforming the profoundly contradictory im pulses within him into dialectical movement Luhmanns work on ob servation will help to clarify why Emersons relentless explorations of these problems cannot and should not resolve themselves into a dialec tic Here again it is not incoherence or vagueness of thought we find I would suggest but rather the genius of what we might call Emersons undoing of romanticism Of the Emerson critics I have read the one who has come closest to realizing this fact about Emersons work is Lee Rust Brown in his wonderful book The Emerson Museum As he observes about Emersons contention in Compensation that the value of the universe con trives to throw itself into every point such moments have been cited by readers who attack or applaud Emerson as a cheerful mystic who vaguely sees everything in everything34 What we have here instead Brown suggests is a more complicated process in which Coleridgean multeity in unity is subordinated to the workings of the observers where the sense found in natural objects is precisely the viewers own original means for seeing them    By virtue of these means vision rises to a place of authority over objects to a kind of perspectival re move sufficient to reveal relations within the whole scope of things 71 72 Yet such an observer is not transcendent in the usual ideal ist senseindeed in any sense Instead on display here is the more complicated dynamic of Emersonian transparencythat ability to perceive the unity of the multeitythat is the one fatal condition of moving on intellectually it is the way we pay for all worthwhile adjustments of attention It is the only way we achieve what Emerson calls new prospectsin Browns words at once the new object and the prospect of its future conversion into transparency 47 Far from being transcendent then we see one object only at the cost of an other 46 and transparency far from signifying a passive state or emer sons romanticism continuity or unity testifies to the way the eye manufactures its own discontinuous intervals 4546 At this juncture Luhmanns work can give us a more fully articu lated sense of Emersons pressure on the problem of observation It is able to do so in part because observation in Luhmann is disarticulated from vision per se and in part because systems theory takes the ad ditional step of showing how the problem of observation is related to that other central topos of romanticism invoked by Brownmulteity in unitywhich must now be rewritten in systems theorys terms as the problem of complexity and how it is handled in systemenviron ment relationships It is this convergencethe paradoxical dynamics of observation and the related problem of complexity how observa tion both reduces and produces complexitythat Emersons writing insists on more and more rigorously as his career unfolds rendering it in his mature work as literally unavoidable as in for example one of his more brazen assertions in Circles that I am a God in nature I am a weed by the wall35 Such a statementand there are many of them in Emersoninsists on the radical identity of what in the philosophical tradition are opposites namely on the one hand the absolute all constitutive subject of knowledge familiar to us from various forms of philosophical idealism the god that is secularized as imagination in romanticism and on the other hand what Kant called the patho logical contingency of the object world and the empirical Luhmann can help us to see how in such apparently outlandish and fanciful para doxes Emerson precisely registers the epistemological fallout of the very modernity to which his romanticism is respondingnot as a mystification or imaginative solution but as a kind of relentless anat omy And here we may locate another advantage of Luhmanns work over Cavells that it links these philosophical and epistemological complexities to the historical conditions of their emergence Only by taking this tack can we understand the underlying semantics and sys tematicity rather than the incoherence or fogginess of the paradox at the core of Emersons work his constant movement between assert ing on the one hand that thought dissolves the material universe and on the other that if in the least particular one could derange the order of naturewho would accept the gift of life36 Emerson insists in other words on the radical contingency and emer sons romanticism at the same time the radical authority of selfreferential observation whose positive existential valence gets figured in the whim of Self Reliance while its more vexing effects are registered in the isolation and vertigo of the opening of Experience and finally in the para doxical fatedness to freedom of The Conduct of Life Such paradoxes are from Luhmanns point of view masked in the theological tradition that Emerson inherits and famously rejects early in his career as a minis ter In fact were we to follow Luhmanns suggestion the closest thing we could find to Emersons work in the theological tradition would be not Quakerism or Unitarianism but the line of medieval theology that works its way from Saint Augustine through John Scotus Eriugena to the fifteenthcentury theologian Nicolaus Cusanus No traditional epistemology Luhmann writes could dare to go this farobviously because the position from which it would have had to deal with dis tinctness was occupied by theology37 But with the secularization of these questions in romanticisms philosophy of the subjectitself Luhmann argues a product of the unavoidable movement from hi erarchical to functionally differentiated society under modernity in which the church no longer has a centering rolethey begin to be come ever more unavoidable With the retreat of the religious world order Luhmann writes the question of how the world can observe itself becomes more pressing and vexing and it is typically answered in romanticism and its forerunner German idealist philosophy by makeshift such terms as Spirit Idea and so on38 Inspired by the idea of God as observer Luhmann writes Theology began to observe this observer even though it was forced to concede that an observer who creates and sustains the world by virtue of his observation excludes nothing and hence cannot assume an ob servable form By externalizing this paradox and by incorporating the notion of observing the unobservable into the idea of God one sought to shield the conventional notion of the world as universitas rerum from infection by logical paradoxes39 The problem with this solution of courseas Harro Muller among others has pointed outis that in an increasingly acentrically conceived society the society of modernity it is difficult to preserve the notion of an Archimedean point from which and towards which both world emer sons romanticism and society might be understood    It is also prohibited from assuming a strictly privileged extramundane observers perspective Such a per spective would place collective singulars such as God Spirit History Man Nature the subject the individual or intersubjectivity at the cen ter of a foundational discourse But these foundational discourses whether of an ontological natural or anthropological natureare predominantly a matter of selfattributions or selfsimplifications that are functionally in need of explanation40 And this is where we need Luhmann We need in other words to use Luhmanns shorthand to re place what questions with how questions41 Here the fundamental postulate of systems theoryits replacement of the familiar ontologi cal dichotomies of humanism culturenature mindbody spiritmat ter reasonfeeling and so on with the functional distinction system environmentis indispensable in allowing us to better understand how systems respond to modernitys central challenge of functional differentiation what other critical vocabularies would call its spe cialization or more moralistically or nostalgically its fragmenta tion As Muller summarizes it Perspectives are multiplied within functionally differentiated modern society without ones being able to adopt any privileged central per spective or assign a hierarchically superior leading position to any one partial system    No partial system may represent the whole and be come active in a representative manner no partial system may replace another as its functional equivalent It is precisely functional differentia tion with its internal increase in control in individual partial systems which increases disorder and risk42 As we saw in the opening chapter for Luhmann both psychic and social systems respond to this complexity by means of autopoiesis and selfreferential closure as a means of selfpreservation Such systems find themselves by definition in an environment that is always already more complex than they are and all systems attempt to adapt to this complexity by filtering it in terms of their own selfreferential codes The point of the system is to reproduce itself but no system can deal with everything or even many things all at once The legal system for example responds to changes in its environment in terms ofand emer sons romanticism only in terms ofthe distinction legalillegal In litigation decisions are not basedand it is a good thing tooon whether you are black or white male or female whether you went to school at Oxford or Cambridge and so on Two subsidiary points need to be accented here First in respond ing to environmental complexity in terms of their own selfreferential codes subsystems build up their own internal complexity one might think here of the various subspecialties of the legal system say or the specialization of disciplines in the education system discussed in chap ter 4 In doing so systems become ever more finely grained in their selectivity and thusin increasing the weblike density of their filters as it werethey buy time in relation to overwhelming environmental complexity As Luhmann puts it in Social Systems Systems lack the requisite variety Ashbys term that would enable them to react to every state of the environment    There is in other words no point forpoint correspondence between system and environment    The systems inferiority in complexity compared to that of the environ ment must be counterbalanced by strategies of selection43 Emersons way of putting this in Nominalist and Realist is that the world is full As the ancient said the world is plenum or solid and if we saw all things that really surround us we should be imprisoned and unable to move44 But if the selfreference of the systems code reduces the flow of environmental complexity into the system it also increases the systems irritability and thus in a real sense its dependence on the environment Hereand this is crucial to understanding the engine if you like of what Cavell calls Emersonian transience onwardness and abandonmentthe term complexity should be understood not as an aggregation of substance a big pile of lots of things or even as an abstract set of relations but more importantly as a set of temporalized re lations that have the character of the Derridean or Deleuzean event Systems use selfreference not just to build up their own internal com plexity but also to stabilize themselves in the temporal flow of events and render events meaningful for the system As Luhmann explains We need a concept of meaning    as the simultaneous presentation    of actuality and possibility45 The totality of the emer sons romanticism be actualized at any moment Thus the form of meaningthe co presentation of the difference between the actual and possiblethrough its referential structure forces the next step to selection46 But as we saw in chapter 1 that selection is only momentarily useful and dete riorates immediately under the pressure of the flow of time which in turn necessitates another selection and so on and so forth One could say Luhmann writes that meaning equips an actual experience or action with redundant possibilitiesnamely what was selected the actual and what could have been the possibleand this is crucial for any systems ability to respond to environmental complexity by build ing up its own complexity via the form of meaning through which the system uses time even as it is subjected to its pressure As Luhmann writes in a key passage we focused on in the opening chapter The genesis and reproduction of meaning presupposes an infrastructure in reality that constantly changes its states Meaning then extracts dif ferences which only as differences have meaning from this substruc ture to enable a differenceoriented processing of information On all meaning therefore are imposed a temporalized complexity and the compulsion to a constant shifting of actuality without meaning itself vibrating in tune with that substructure 63 Read against this background the rigor of moments such as this one in Emersons The Method of Nature becomes I believe more apparent The method of nature who could ever analyze it That rushing stream will not stop to be observed We can never surprise nature in a corner never find the end of a thread    The wholeness we admire in the order of the world is the result of infinite distribution    Its permanence is a perpetual inchoation Every natural fact is an emanation and that from which it emanates is an emanation also and from every emanation is a new emanation If anything could stand still it would be crushed and dissipated by the torrent it resisted and if it were a mind would be crazed as insane persons are those who hold fast to one thought and do not flow with the course of nature47 Subordinating the problem of selfreferential observation to the larger problem of complexity helps clarify why it is misguided at best to charge systems theory in general and the theory of autopoiesis in particular with asserting a kind of solipsistic relationship between the emer sons romanticism system and its environment As we have seen throughout the first half of this book what such a characterization misses is the seemingly para doxical fact that the autopoietic closure of a systemwhether social or psychicis precisely what connects it to its environment As Luhmann explains it The concept of a selfreferentially closed system does not contradict the systems openness to the environment Instead in the self referential mode of operation closure is a form of broadening possible environmental contacts closure increases by constituting elements more capable of being determined the complexity of the environment that is possible for the system48 Autopoiesis and complexity are conceptual coordinates    Dependency and independence in a simple causal sense are therefore not invariant magnitudes in that more of one would imply less of the other Rather they vary according to a systems given level of complexity In systems that are successful in evolutionary terms more independence typically amounts to a greater dependency on the environment    But all of this can happen only on the basis of the systems operative closure49 Or as Luhmann will put it in one of his more Zenlike moments Only complexity can reduce complexity50 All of this leads to a paradoxical situation that is central to Luhmanns work and central as we saw in the last chapter to under standing his reworking of problems inherited from Hegel and from romanticism more generallyproblems that bear directly on our read ing of Emerson What links the system to the world what literally makes the world available to the system is also what hides the world from the system what makes it unavailable Given our earlier discus sion of the problem of representing the unrepresentable this will sound like the familiar topos of the romantic sublime but with this crucial difference if all systems interface with their environments in terms of and only in terms of their own constitutive distinctions and selfreferential codes then the environment is not an ontological cate gory but a functional one That is to say it is not an outside to the system that is given as such but is rather always the outside of a specific inside Or as Luhmann deftly explains it the environment is different for every system because any system excludes only itself from its en vironment51 And with this turn Luhmann writes the distinction emer sons romanticism between selfreference and heteroreference is relocated within the ob served observing system or to put it another way the distinction between self and heteroreference is nothing other than the reentry of the distinction systemenvironment into the system itself52 As we have seen in greater detail in earlier chapters however this means that there is a paradoxical identity between the two sides of the systems constitutive distinction because the reentered distinc tion between both sides system and environment is itself a product of only one side the system Anda crucial corollaryno system can acknowledge this paradoxical identity of difference which is also in another sense simply the contingency of its own constitutive distinction and at the same time use that distinction to carry out its operations It must remain blind to the very paradox of the distinction that links it to its environment That does not mean that this blind spot cannot be observed from the vantage of another observer another system using another code but any secondorder observation will itself be based on its own blind spotthat is to say it will have the same contingency and the same formal character This is what Emerson is insisting on I think when he writes Nature will not be Buddhist she resents generalizing and insults the philosopher in every moment with a million fresh particulars It is all idle talking as much as a man is whole so is he also a part and it were partial not to see it What you say in your pompous distribution only distributes you into your class and section You have not got rid of parts by denying them but are the more partial You are one thing but na ture is one thing and the other thing in the same moment53 Such a passage may be quite precisely unpacked I think against the background of Luhmanns fruitful reworking of the Hegelian prob lematic that I have already discussed a difference that inheres in the contingency of selfreferential distinction itself you are one thing or in another sense in the difference between first and secondorder observation you have not got rid of parts by denying them but are the more partial And this is of course a productive difference from the vantage of the problem of overwhelming environmental complex ity and a systems need to reduce it it has no choice but to be54 This is what Emerson is reaching for in Nominalist and Realist emer sons romanticism I think when he writes that excluded attributes burst in on us with the more brightness that they have been excluded Your turn now my turn next is the rule of the game The universality being hindered in its primary form comes in the secondary form of all sides the points come in succession to the meridian and by the speed of rotation a new whole is formed 142 This might sound at first blush Hegelian but the key differencecontra the invocation of dialectic by Gonnaudis Emersons strident insistence on the primacy and paradoxical contin gency of the observer an insistence that reaches its peak in Essays Second Series As Luhmann in a passage I have had occasion to cite more than once explains the relationship between observation and what Emerson calls the horizon The source of a distinctions guaranteeing reality lies in its own op erative unity It is however precisely as this unity that the distinction cannot be observedexcept by means of another distinction which then assumes the function of a guarantor of reality Another way of expressing this is to say the operation emerges simultaneously with the world which as a result remains cognitively unapproachable to the operation The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the connection with the reality of the external world is established by the blind spot of the cognitive operation Reality is what one does not perceive when one perceives it55 The world is now conceived along the lines of a Husserlian metaphor as an unreachable horizon that retreats further with each operation without ever holding out the prospect of an outside56 This is the way Emersons essay Circles begins The eye is the first circle the hori zon which it forms is the second and throughout nature this primary figure is repeated without end    Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that around every circle another can be drawn that there is no end in nature but every end is a beginning57 The question thenand this is directly related to the problems raised by the topos of the romantic sublimeis in Luhmanns words how to observe how the world observes itself how a marked space emerges via a constitutive distinction from the unmarked space how something becomes invisible when something else becomes vis ible Any observation renders the world invisible in relation to its emer sons romanticism constitutive distinction and that invisibility must itself remain invis ible to the observation that employs that distinctionwhich in turn can only be disclosed by another observation that will also necessar ily be doubly blind in the same way58 Here is Emerson again from Circles There is no outside no inclosing wall on circumference to us The man finishes his storyhow good how final how it puts a new face on all things He fills the sky Lo on the other side rises also a man and draws a circle around the circle we had just pronounced the outline of the sphere Then already is our first speaker not man but only a first speaker His only redress is forthwith to draw a circle outside his antagonist And so do men by themselves59 In this two fold sense as Luhmann puts itwhat an observing distinction reveals and what it can be shown to hidethe notion of a final unityof an ultimate reality that cannot assume a form because it has no other sideis displaced into the unobservable    If the concept of the world is retained to indicate reality in its entirety then it is that whichto a secondorder observerremains invisible in the movements of obser vation his own and those of others60 We can return in this light to a rather different understanding of the significance of the Kantian settlement with skepticism reframed in terms of the signal importance of the formal dynamics of observation As Luhmann puts it succinctly if we ask what new insights the con cept of observation first and secondorder observation has to offer the answer is it traces the problem of unity back to the ultimate form of paradox 96 In a way Luhmann writes All this can be handled with the dereification of the concept of the world introduced already by Kant World is no longer a totality of things a universitas rerum but rather the final and therewith un observable condition of possibility of observations that is of every sort of use of distinctions To formulate this another way the world must be invisibilized so that observations become possible For every observation requires a blind spot or more precisely it can only in dicate one side of the distinction being used employing it as a start ing point for subsequent observations but not the distinction itself as a unity and above all not the unmarked space precisely the world from which every distinction as soon as it is marked as a distinction must be delimited61 emer sons romanticism Even more striking perhaps are the consequences of this fact as they are described by Luhmann and recorded with rather bracing astrin gency in essays like Emersons Experience Luhmann continues This invisibilization of the nevertheless doubtlessly given and presup posed world had dramatic consequences for Kant Fichte and above all for the Romantics Its leads to an overburdening of the individual with expectations regarding the production of meaning and therewith to the collapse of the communication weighed down with such expectations The individual endowed with reflection now received the title sub ject But the higher and more complex the expectations that subjects direct toward themselves and their others the greater is the probability of a failure of their communications 517 It is precisely this overburdening that haunts Emersons essay Experi ence where he writes We must hold hard to this poverty however scandalous and by more vigorous selfrecoveries after the sallies of action possess our axis more firmly The life of truth is cold and so far mournful but it is not the slave of tears contritions and pertur bations It is a truth we are told that all the muses and love and religion hate and they will find a way to punish the chemist who publishes in the parlor the secrets of the laboratory not the least of which is the quintessentially Emersonian announcement that it is very unhappy but too late to be helped the discovery we have made that we exist62 Such is what Luhmann calls the toxic quality of secondorder observation63 and it is on display not just in Emersons middle and late phase in Essays Second Series and The Conduct of Life but even in earlier works as well such as The American Scholar where he writes We are lined with eyes we see with our feet the time is infected with Hamlets unhappinessSicklied oer with the pale cast of thought Is it so bad then Sight is the last thing to be pitied Would we be blind64 Here too we may locate the signal advantage of systems theorys ability to combine epistemological and historical frames in ways that are especially useful for sorting out the relationship between Emersons thinking and his terminologyways that open up a rather different understanding of the relationship between Emersons thinking and writing from what we have already seen in Cavell What I have been emer sons romanticism arguing is that a term such as selfrecovery in the passage just cited should be understood not as recovery of a primordial preexistent self but as recovery of the onwardness of the selfs movement through which and only in whichas we have already seen in Cavells analysis of the proof of the self in SelfReliancethe self actually exists at all As Emerson puts it in Circles The way of life is wonderful It is by abandonment 181 Or more flatly still from Experience Life is a series of surprises and would not be worth taking or keeping if it were not 206 Selfrecovery then is paradoxically oriented not toward some originary state but toward futurity toward not being but becoming As Emerson writes in Circles Valor consists in the power of selfrecovery so that a man cannot have his flank turned cannot be outgeneraled but put him where you will he stands This can only be by preferring truth to his past apprehension of truth 177 italics mine Paradoxically as I have been arguing the only way for the Emersonian self to stand is to not stand to not stand still but to move in abandonment beyond the self of apprehension that one was only a second ago The only way to stand then is to understand to stand down if you like And the achievement of the self is now to be seen not as an active willing but as a maximally and paradoxically active passivity As Emerson puts it in Experience All I know is reception 212 This same misdirection could be found in a whole host of terms in Emerson Intuition Reason Law Spirit Being just to name a few that have encouraged readers for years to understand Emersons work as a quaintly failed metaphysics What systems theory enables us to do however is to map the residual versus emergent dimensions of Emersons work to use Raymond Williamss wellknown terms in ways not reducible to his terminology alone as Eduardo Cadava has done quite subtly I think with Emersons relationship to the discourse of race for which we have to attend to the systematicityand not just the lexiconof his thought65 Once we do so we find as Harro Muller puts it that selfdescriptions must themselves be temporalized    Assumptions of substance or of metahistoric essences metahistorical anthropologies metahistorically grounded notions of experience and so on are all forms of thought that are no longer reconcilable with func tional differentiation From Luhmanns perspective this is all part of emer sons romanticism an oldEuropean heritage that    can at best be correlated with the still existing stratificatory elements in modern society66 Which is simply to explain in so many words why Experienceeven as it also uses the term selfrecoveryis a far more original and forwardlooking text than Nature Moreover it confronts in a number of emotional and philosophi cal registers another consequence noted by Luhmann that the forc ing of subjectivity as the single answer to the problem of world makes intersubjectivity difficult indeed if one is conceptually rigorous ac tually impossible67 As I have suggested elsewhere it is precisely on the basis of the disclosure of that impossibility that the possibility of democracy is foundedbut only as Cavell would put it by being un founded or left foundering68 But rather than pursue that argument further here I will simply end with the last lines of Emersons essay Nominalist and Realist which enigmatically beautifully madden ingly gathers together some of the threads I have been tracing only to throw them to the winds Is it that every man believes every other to be an incurable partialist and himself an universalist I talked yesterday with a pair of philoso phers I endeavored to show my good men that I liked everything by turns and nothing long that I loved the centre but doated on the su perficies that I loved man if men seemed to me mice and rats    that I was glad of men of every gift and nobility but would not live in their arms Could they but once understand that I loved to know that they existed and heartily wished them Godspeed yet out of my poverty of life and thought had no word or welcome for them when they came to see me and could well consent to their living in Oregon for any claim I felt on them it would be a great satisfaction69 This page intentionally left blank Systems Theory Poetry and Form beyond Formalism In this chapter I will revisit on the terrain of literary art generally and poetry specifically some of the questions examined in my earlier discussion of contemporary architecture in light of recent work in sys tems theory I also hope to show how my earlier attempts to use systems theory to rethink fundamental questions associated with romanticism can open up a space in which we may describe more precisely the be guiling formal questions that attend the work of romantic modern ists such as Wallace Stevens In extending this line of investigation regarding the theory of art and more specifically the relations or dis relations between literature and more specifically poetry and other art forms such as architecture music and sculpture I also hope to in tervene in recent conversations driven by a resurgence of interest over the past decade in the question of form in literary and cultural studies The fundamental contours and stakes of those recent conversations are brought out magisterially and with characteristic evenhandedness by Marjorie Levinson in a PMLA essay on the changing profession titled What Is New Formalism Levinson the idea of observation at k ey w est of historicism to treat artworks as bundles of historical and cultural content In place of this simpleminded mimesis it wants to restore to todays reductive reinscription of historical reading its original focus on form of the sort found in the materialist critiques of Adorno Marx Althusser Jameson and Macherey As for the second it attempts to bring back a sharp demarcation between history and art discourse and literature with form regarded as the condition of aesthetic expe rience as traced to Kantie disinterested autotelic playful pleasur able consensusgenerating and therefore both individually liberating and conducive to affect social cohesion the prerogative of art1 This last assertion leads us in turn to the first of two important ob servations by Levinson first that for many of these critics the concept of form as productive rather than merely reflective as one critic cited by her puts it serves an essentially humanist project of edificationit takes on a broadly pedagogical humanizing cast reviving Schillers model of aesthetic education 563 Second as Levinson his wellknown articulation of the autopoietic closure and difference of psychic systems and social systems consciousness and communi cation which I have discussed in previous chapters It is within the context of this difference that Luhmann understands the significance to poetry of characteristic themes and problems such as incommuni cability ineffability silence and so on But he understands them spe cifically within a posthumanist context that is to say as expressions not of a psychological or emotional interiority or intentionality that reveals itself in language even if only to gesture toward languages inadequacy in the face of the ineffable but as expressions of a set of differencesmost importantly the difference between communi cation and perception which in poetry are miraculously made to coincide as he puts it when the material form of the signifier seems to duplicate the semantics of communication in familiar devices such as rhyme rhythm and so on Or we might say even more precisely in light of W K Wimsatts famous thesis about the differential relations of semantics and acoustics in rhymed English poetry in his classic essay One Relation of Rhyme to Reason in which the material form of the signifier has a systematic relation to the semantic content of words even if that relationship is systematically as Wimsatt suggested in English rhyme one of difference or contrast3 But this is only part of the story and what I want to insist on here is that in Luhmanns scattered writings on poetry we need to separate and indeed disarticulate two main strands that tend to get confused what we might call the perceptual or the phenomenological on the one hand which has to do with the familiar prosodic aspects of poetry that I just mentioned and on the other what we might call poetrys abstract formal aspect Take for example the following passage from Art as a Social System The choice of words as a medium creates a compelling and unusu ally dense combination of selfreference and heteroreference run ning through the entire text Words carry and signify their ordinary meanings and this is why they refer to something other not just to themselves At the same time however they also carry and signify a special textual meaning within which they execute and propel the texts recursions Textart organizes itself by means of selfreferential the idea of observation at k ey w est unity of selfreference and heteroreference lies in the sensuous percep tibility of words4 There are it seems to me two different claims here one having to do with the abstract recursive dynamics of selfreference in relation to the form of the artwork as such and one having specifically to do with the perceptual material aspects of words used as a medium typically associated with traditional prosodic devices I want to insist that these two be kept rigorously separate for to elide them is to obscure the most profound and original aspect of Luhmanns work on art which is his mobilization of a specific concept of form to make sense of arts special relationship special that is visàvis the other social systems to the paradoxical dynamics of selfreference and observation What I want to bring out here is how in Luhmanns analysis the perceptual and the material are radically subordinated to the problem of form and to forms relationship to the paradoxical dynamics of observa tion I would even argue more forcefully that the former is even in a fundamental sense superfluous to what makes poetry art at all in Luhmanns senseand is superfluous in a way that helps us under stand how paradoxically poetry that is least replete with prosodic fea tures such as stanzaic regularity rhyme alliteration and so on I have in mind here the work of a Wallace Stevens say or a Marianne Moore to name two can in a sense be regarded for that very reason as most poetic in the specific sense developed by Luhmann I am going to focus here however briefly on the Stevens Luhmann pairing because both have been associated so insistently and have often associated themselveswith the core problems of ro manticism that make their way from Kant and Hegel through Coleridge and British romanticism then detour importantly for Stevens if we believe Harold Bloom via Emerson in the United States to more recent inheritors such as the phenomenology of Husserl5 In a classic essay from about twenty years ago Albert Gelpi used the StevensWilliam Carlos Williams relationship to tease out the contours of the roman tic problematic inherited by Stevens What Gelpi called the romantic modernism of Stevens and Williams aimed to restore the primacy of the imagination in poetry versus the historically and anthropo logically oriented antiromantic modernism of Pound and Eliot and it plagued romanticism round one This consisted chiefly in what Gelpi calls the unstable Romantic synthesis of subject or imagination and object or world in which the individual became the inspired locus for an intuitive perception of the spiritual forms and energies that invested the otherwise fragmented phenomenal world with an ex alted coherence6 Stevens and Williams Gelpi writes considered the chief challenge to the Modernist poetone of lifeordeath urgency to be the redefinition of the function of the imagination liberating it from its shaky epistemological premises 5 But what this ends up meaningtheir solution if you likeis that the twentiethcentury poet became less the recipient than the agent of perception or as Williams put it attempting to finesse the problem further the poem rejects plagiarism after nature and constructs a reality not opposed to nature but apposed to it In Gelpis words in its apposition to na ture the verbal construct serves to mediate the epistemological schism between subject and object 6 Really How so What I would like to suggest is that such solutions are simply renamings of the fundamental problem that concerns Gelpiand con cerned Stevens And so in Gelpis essay we find simply a series of such restatements for Stevens for example sensation is not just a passively received impression but an actively and accurately achieved response 7 But what can accurately mean here given everything weve just said And where we end up then is pretty much where we began While Modernism constitutes on one level an overt and programmatic rejection of Romanticism it constitutes on another level an extension of the epistemological issues that the decadence of Romanticism pre cipitated In terms of the subjectobject split Imagism and for Gelpi Williams represents the attempt to render the objects of experience Symbolism and for Gelpi Stevens the attempt to render subjective psychological and affective states    Faced with the polarity between subject and object we must try to accommodate both terms and under that pressure the terms tend to slip in and out of one another 12 Gelpis diagnosis of the problem is also a symptom of the need to find a more precise way of describing itand describing how what is apparently most paradoxical and selfdefeating about it is actually the idea of observation at k ey w est what is most specific and productive about it With the help of systems theory I think that the core problem here can be stated precisely it is the paradoxical fact that both selfreference and heteroreference or otherreference are themselves both products of selfreference Where do we go from here and why is this not a form of philo sophical idealism are two questions that the rest of this chapter will attempt to address In doing so I hope to also suggest that the problem with understanding Stevenss romantic modernism has been more a problem with the criticism itself his own included by the way than with the poetry In fact it seems to me that Stevenss poetry navigates the problems outlined by Gelpi with a rigor subtlety and keenness for which we have had no adequate critical vocabulary thus far What I want to suggestand I can only gesture toward it here is that Luhmanns work is especially valuable in helping us to tease out and if you like formalize the poetics of the mature Stevens which for many readers take on an increasingly paradoxical cast and philosophi cal austerity as his career tends more and more to late poems such as An Ordinary Evening in New Haven Or to put this slightly other wise Stevenss own description of that poetic project in texts like The Necessary Angel and in doctrines if we can call them that such as the supreme fiction has seemed for many readers rather disappointing and insufficiently articulated alongside the rigor and precision of the poetry itselfa rigor that is not logical or conceptual exactly but is nevertheless what I would call a systematic confrontation with the problems I have already sketched under the rubric of romanticism In particular Stevens puts increasingly intense pressure as few poets have on the problem of observation its paradoxical dynamics in rela tion to reality and imagination all of which and this would be an other different kind of chapter are traced by Luhmann to the funda mental structures of modernity itself namely as I have noted in earlier chapters modernity as functional differentiation But to return to the question at hand to understand why po etry that is least poetic in prosodic terms may be seen as most poetic in Luhmanns terms we have to remember the point emphasized earlier in chapter 8 that in Luhmanns work on art the difference between perception and communication is paramount The meaning of a work of art cannot be reduced to its perceptual material or phenomenal as pect this is we will remember the lesson for Luhmann of a Duchamp a Cage oras I suggested earlierKawaras Date Paintings Instead the work of art copresents the difference between perception and com munication and reenters that difference on the side of its own commu nication its own meaning To understand how this happens we need to recall not just that perception and beyond that consciousness and communication op erate in mutually exclusive operationally closed autopoietic systems though they are structurally coupled through media such as language we also need to remember that the relationship between them is asym metrical7 The mind is its own operationally closed biological system but because it is also a necessary medium for communication we can say that the mind has the privileged position of being able to disturb stimulate and irritate communication 379 The mind the psychic system in other words constantly produces noise in systems the ory parlance for the communication system the social system and the challenge for communication is thus how to secure the necessary participation of psychic systems while at the same time ensuring its own continuation through the autopoiesis of its own structures and not those of the psychic system8 The irreducibility and asymmetry of perception to communica tion are crucial for several reasons First perception and communi cation operate at different speedsand this is something art puts to good use The faster speed of perception and neuronal processing makes it appear that perception stabilizes and makes immediate while communication which operates with a sequential selective process differs and defers9 Luhmann observes that perception in contrast to thought and communication can decide quickly whereas art aims to retard perception and render it reflexivelingering upon the object in visual art in striking contrast to everyday perception and slow ing down reading in literature particularly lyric poetry10 In the work of art this difference between perception and communication is then reentered on the side of the artworks communication 142a com munication that accomplishes this goal or fails to do so by facing the usual and perhaps even increased risks involved in all communica tion Art communicates by using perceptions contrary to their primary purpose 22 As a reentered element in arts communication then the idea of observation at k ey w est perception serves the following role What strikes us in an art form as in a different way does the conspicuous character of acoustic and optic signalsengenders a fascination that turns into information by changing the state of the observers systemas a difference that makes a difference 26 In fact as we have already noted this difference is what allows art to have a special relationship to what is commonly invoked as the ineffable or the incommunicable And it is also as Luhmann shrewdly combine elements of sound rhythm and meaning 26 But poetry is not just rhymed prose he continues If one reads poetry as a sequence of propositions about the world and considers the poetic only as beautification adornment or decoration one does not observe it as a work of art    Only at the level where symbols sounds meanings and rhythms conspirea level that is dif ficult to readdo poems refer to themselves in the process of creating forms They generate contextual dependencies ironic the idea of observation at k ey w est literature of romanticism such as unity in multeity but as Luhmann points out It should be clear by now that this analysis precludes com prehending an artwork in terms of the relations between a whole and its parts Dividing a work and judging the relationship between parts misses its internal nexus a nexus that is about the recursive and para doxical selfreference of form that is not limited to the sensuous aspect of words 120 italics mine If one wants to isolate parts he contin ues then one discovers that their contribution to the work consists in what they are not what they make available for further elaboration 120 This amounts in a way to a deconstruction of Coleridges dis tinction between fancy and imaginationin which the workings of fancy Luhmanns slow linear processes of communication are focused on the aggregative combinatory buildup of resemblances and variations in a concept or trope in a mechanic and logical fashion as Coleridge put it while consciousness and imagination are preoccupied with an intuitive grasp of the works form of recursive selfreference on the most abstract level the larger organic or unifying power to use Coleridges terms that these fanciful combinations serve It also helps to clarify the relationship between a systems theoreti cal analysis of art and the discourse of the romantic sublime because in this wayas I have already suggested in the discussions of both Emersons philosophy and contemporary architecturethe problems that the discourse of the sublime attempts to address can be assimi lated to the more formally rigorous schema of the difference between first and secondorder observation in systems theory Firstorder ob servations we recall use distinctions as a schema but do not yet cre ate a contingency for the observer himself as Luhmann puts it The distinction is postulated but not designated in the designation it thus does not act in a way that would make it apparent that it could be otherwise11 Secondorder observations on the other hand provide grounds for including contingency in meaning and perhaps reflecting upon it conceptually because they are observations of observations they take into account the codes and distinctions used by firstorder ob servers including what those distinctions leave out or occludetheir latencies Or as Luhmann puts it Everything becomes contingent whenever what is observed depends on who is being observed 48 Most of alland here the line of descent from German romanti cism through Emerson and on to both Luhmann and Stevens is espe cially clearsecondorder observations take account of the fact that the two sides of a distinction which appear in firstorder observation as opposites are in fact when seen by secondorder observation de pendent on a deeper unity what in Hegelian parlance would be called the identity of identity and nonidentity As I have emphasized in earlier chapters it is that paradoxical identityofdifference to which the firstorder system must remain blind if it is to use that code to carry out its own operations and observations But the same is true for any secondorder observations as well Observation of the second order Luhmann writes retains throughout the operative charac teristics of all observation    The concept of observation remains in variant for the first and second orders and requires no other language metalanguage 49 Thusand this is the key point for rewriting the problematics of the romantic sublimefor Luhmann any observation renders the world invisible in relation to its constitutive selfreferential distinc tion in the sense that the very thing that makes the world cognitively or communicationally available is also the very thing that occludes it and renders it invisible by its selectivity and that invisibility must it self remain invisible to the observation that employs that distinction which in turn can only be disclosed by another observation that will also necessarily be doubly blind in the same way12 In this twofold sense Luhmann writes the notion of a final unityof an ultimate reality that cannot assume a form because it has no other sideis dis placed into the unobservable    If the concept of the world is retained to indicate reality in its entirety then it is that whichto a second order observerremains invisible in the movements of observation his own and those of others 91 So on the one hand Luhmann explains a work of art must distinguish itself externally from other objects and events or it will lose itself in the world it closes itself off by limiting further possibilities with each of its formal decisions On the other hand whatever distinction is used at any given time cannot be indicated as a unitythis condition reproduces itself with every dis tinction It merely displaces the blind spot of observation 29 As Luhmann summarizes it in a key formulation With this mediation we arrive at a world extant in the difference between the the idea of observation at k ey w est sameness and otherness of observations of the first and second order As so often elsewhere it is also true here reducing complexity by de ploying observations is the means to generate complexity13 And this meansas I emphasized earlier in my discussion of Diller  Scofidios Blurnot only that art can no longer be understood as an imitation of something that presumably exists along with and outside of art but more importantly for our purposes that to the extent that imitation is still possible it now imitates the worlds invisibility a nature that can no longer be apprehended as a whole14 The paradox unique to art which art creates and resolves Luhmann writes resides in the observability of the unobservable 149 And it is here that form finds its function It is important to note however that the word formal here does not refer to the distinction which at first guided modern art between form and matter or form and content but to the characteristics of an indicating operation that observes as if from the corner of its eye what happens on the other side of form In this way the work of art points the observer toward an observation of form    It consists in demonstrating the compelling forces of order in the realm of the possible 148 In this way form stages the question of whether an observer can ob serve at all except with reference to an order 148 but it also stages the contingency of that orderthat is to say the production of the unobservable the blind spot of observation the outside of the art work that unavoidably accompanies such observations 149 The function of art is to make the world appear within the world with an eye toward the ambivalent situation that every time something is made available for observation something else withdraws that in other words the activity of distinguishing and indicating that goes on in the world conceals the world    Yet a work of art is capable of symbol izing the reentry of the world into the world because it appearsjust like the worldincapable of emendation 149 italics mine The work of art to put it succinctly is radically contingent and at the same time constituted by internal necessity To return to the issue of poetry specifically what this means for a poet like Wallace Stevens is that the less poetic Stevens isthe more we find an absence of the traditional prosodic devices rhyme allit eration etc that foreground the difference between perception and communicationthe more poetic he is in the specific sense of formally modeling the very dynamics of the observableunobservable that Luhmann describes This example helps clarify too the difference be tween Luhmanns recursive selfreference of form and say Jakobsons notion of the projection of the principle of reduplication from the axis of selection to the axis of combination in poetic discourse To put this in an even better way the paring away of conspicuous poetic features in Stevenss work can be seen as functioning in two different ways First it serves a communication in which the motivated refusal to indulge traditional prosodic devices is an important element of the poetrys meaning it communicates its meaning by not being present a calculated formal decision that signifies against its literaryhistorical background along the lines of Miles Daviss famous pronouncement that what is important is not the the idea of observation at k ey w est understood precisely in the terms made available by Luhmann Stevenss poetics of increasingly rigorous refinement and arid abstraction moves steadily away from a dependence on the perceptual and the prosodic and force us to fix our attention on the fundamentaland fundamen tally paradoxicalaspect of poetry and of art generally as Luhmann de fines it the crucial determinations between the question of form and the paradoxical relations of the visible and invisible the observable and un observable which have typically been handled in literature and philoso phy under the rubrics of the sublime imagination versus fancy and so on For how else are we to account for much less explain Stevenss pen chant for not just courting but pressuring paradox as few poets have the Stevens whose fundamental mode is to repeatedly insist on both things as they are The Man with the Blue Guitar and what I saw  Or heard or felt came not but from myself Tea at the Palaz of Hoon But not just Stevens one might add I offer here without fur ther comment the opening stanza of Laura Ridings remarkable poem Opening of Eyes Thought looking out on thought Makes one an eye One is the mind selfblind The other is thought gone To be seen from afar and not known Thus is a universe very soon16 Or the wonderfully realized and only slightly less beguiling The World and I here in its entirety This is not exactly what I mean Any more than the sun is the sun But how to mean more closely If the sun shines but approximately What a world of awkwardness What hostile implements of sense Perhaps this is as close a meaning As perhaps becomes such knowing Else I think the world and I Must live together as strangers and die A sour love each doubtful whether Was ever a thing to love the other No better for both to be nearly sure Each of eachexactly where Exactly I and exactly the world Fail to meet by a moment and a word 187 Those paradoxical dynamics of observation and selfreference are obviously on display as well in a whole host of Stevens poems and they achieve a pitch and resonance not unlike Ridings at the end of Esthétique du Mal where Stevens recurs to the same figural and phenomenological topos One might have thought of sight but who could think Of what it sees for all the ill it sees Speech found the ear for all the evil sound But the dark italics it could not propound And out of what one sees and hears and out Of what one feels who could have thought to make So many selves so many sensuous worlds As if the air the midday air was swarming With the metaphysical changes that occur Merely in living as and where we live17 And it receives what one might call even more technical topographical treatment in The Idea of Order at Key West which is careful to dis tinguish the observations of the single artificer addressed in the poem and the observations of those observationsand their significanceby the speaker and his strange companion pale Ramon Fernandez Stevens is characteristically assiduous when he writes It was her voice that made The sky acutest at its vanishing She measured to the hour its solitude She was the single artificer of the world In which she sang And when she sang the sea Whatever self it had became the self That was her song for she was the maker Then we As we beheld her striding there alone Knew that there never was a world for her Except the one she sang and singing made 12930 italics mine the idea of observation at k ey w est This does not mean that we are dealing here with concepts for as we have already seen art consists precisely in presenting what cannot be conceptualized but can nevertheless be communicatedand com municated in the case of this poem by the poems staging and restag ing of and increasingly recursive responses to the central question of the poem Whose spirit is this we said because we knew It was the spirit that we sought and knew That we should ask this often as she sang 129 italics mine But why not ask this just once Because apparently it cannot be answered only oncethat is once and for all a fact the poem recursively builds up through the increasing submission of its key terms song sea to a relentlessly erosive provisional phalanx of ands buts ifs and yets Or to put it in Luhmanns terms the song of the single artificer her observation that makes the sky acutest at its vanishingdiscloses a spirit and not a substance not the binaries of mindnature subject object imaginationreality and so on among which we must choose as either philosophical idealists or realists but rather a form a movement of observation whose engine is double and for that reason irreducible with no resting place the paradoxical differenceinidentity of obser vations constitutive structure and the difference between first and secondorder observations a difference that by definition of course takes time Thus not song or sea but a third term spirit And hence the only answer to the question Whose spirit is this would not be indeed could not beeither song or sea but might be oddly enough Often18 I put it in this odd way to clarify that we are not dealing here simply with problems of logic Quite the contrary for as Luhmann writes the problem of the paradoxical selfreference of any observa tion cannot be solved by logical maneuvering but one can only    hope to find a less sensitive spot where the problem can be temporarily tolerated which leads in turn to the realization that paradoxes can be undertaken more or less skillfully can have a more or less unblock ing effect can be more or less fruitful19 As in art for example Indeed this is perhaps what Stevens meant when he suggestedrather enig matically after allthat the function of the poet is to help people to live their lives Such is the spirit I think of Stevenss suggestion about the poets function earlier in that same passage that certainly it is not to lead people out of the confusion in which they find them selves Nor is it I think to comfort them while they follow their read ers to and fro20 But it is also not just a problem of logic in a second and more important and compelling sensea sense that once again depends on our paying attention to the disarticulation of consciousness and com munication that we have insisted on in these pages For as Luhmann observes in his  the idea of observation at k ey w est selfreferenceand the experience of it as an actuality in the disjunc tion between consciousness and communication the experience of something that in a way is impossible and yet oscillates before us reveals that the inference from nondescribability to nonexistence is not logically tenable22 And this question opens in turn on to another that I cannot pursue adequately in this book though it is surely already on the table in chapter 3 the relations and disrelations of philosophy and literature in the services of that broader thing called knowledge Or as Stevens puts it in Metaphors of a Magnifico Twenty men crossing a bridge Into a village Are twenty men crossing twenty bridges Into twenty villages Or one man Crossing a single bridge into a village This is old song That will not declare itself Twenty men crossing a bridge Into a village Are Twenty men crossing a bridge Into a village That will not declare itself Yet is certain as meaning    Poems 19 A pure paradox an utter tautology And yet somehow true Or perhaps we should say real 11 The Digital the Analog and the Spectral Echographies from My Life in the Bush of Ghosts When Brian Eno and David Byrnes record My Life in the Bush of Ghosts was rereleased on its twentyfifth anniversary in 2006 it occa sioned much reflection on a piece of music that many listeners felt was far ahead of its timeand many felt on rerelease had never gotten its just critical desserts The record wasnt neglected by any means but as Byrne points out in the liner the digital the analog and the spectr al New Orleans just to name a fewthe record seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere And with this polyglot glossolalia anchored to a musical fusion of electronica funk and Afrofuturism the record seemed to issue simultaneously from both the past and the future communicating the portents of ancient and wrathful gods and demons while at the same time constituting a kind of synthdriven laboratory for the music of the future or what one critic at the time called avant funk A record from a Fourth World to borrow Jon Hassells term from everywhere and nowhere past and future1 In a word spectral On another level the uncanniness of the Bush of Ghosts project may be understood as a kind of echography to use the phrase of Bernard Stiegler and Jacques Derrida from their conversations collected as Echographies of Television of an electronic medium whose apotheo sis so the story goes is the digitalizationofallmedia discussed and sometimes debunked in texts such as Lev Manovichs The Language of New Media2 To put it far too telegraphically my suggestion here will be that the ByrneEno record proleptically evokes what will become the seething hiving bush of digital media and then populates it haunts it with analog ghosts Moreover that echography takes the form of a strategic resistance to a generic disembodied abstract rendering and I mean that in a technical sense as well see of both the voice and the image under digital media whose maximal expression might well be viewed as Donna Haraway long ago pointed out as the US military operations theory C3Icommandcontrolcommunication intelligenceand its recent manifestation for example in the video images now widely circulated on the Internet of various smart weapon systems used by the United States in both Gulf Wars3 It is worth noting in this connection that the original LP was conceived and recorded on the heels of the year 1979 a year of ominous geopolitical upheaval that included the Iranian hostage crisis and the Soviet inva sion of Afghanistan the connections between the US support of the Mujahideen resistance to the Soviets in Afghanistan and the rise of alQaeda are common knowledge at this point and the anniversary rerelease took place of course at the height of the second Gulf War and the occupation of Iraq In these multiple contexts the original LPs ample use of vocal materials from Islam and more pointedly still the expurgation of the track Quran from all but the initial vinyl and CD the digital the analog and the spectr al releases4 makes the record all the more uncannya circumstance made even spookier by the fact that the omission of Quran goes un remarked in both the ByrneEno and David Toop liner the digital the analog and the spectr al from the globalization of capitalism and in particular capitalisms tight ening of the relationship between information and commodification10 Equally important is the logic of rendering in not just economic but biopolitical forms of organization As Nicole Shukin has argued rendering not only is an expression of what Foucault famously calls biopower but also has its roots in the process of rendering animal flesh in the disassembly lines of the Chicago stockyards of the early twentieth centurya process viewed by over a million people during the Worlds Columbian Exposition of 1893 It also had a profound in fluence on Henry Ford and thus on the first automobile assembly line processes in the United States all of which Shukin reminds us were contemporary with Eadweard Muybridges experiments with animal images in his Zoopraxiscope in the 1890s This fundamental discreti zation and reorganization of the assemblage of knowledges and per ceptions in and around the problem of bodies movement and time is Shukin argues a prolepsis of the cinematic as she puts it in the vertical abattoir can be discerned not only the logistical prototype of cars and films material production assembly suture but also the mi metic blueprint for a new order of aesthetic experience11 But to read the significance of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts as only an expression of those economic social and biopolitical forces would be to engage in another sort of fundamentalism a fundamentalism calculated to flee precisely those sorts of ghosts that Derridas work will help us identify and as it were reanimate Digital media as Bernard Stiegler puts it depend above all on a sys tematic discretization and grammaticalization of contentitself part of the larger regime of what Derrida calls calculation whose philosophical and ethical resonances I have explored in some detail in earlier chapters12 Unlike the analog photographic image for example and here we will return to some of the questions of visual media that occupied us in chapter 6 in the digital image one has as Stiegler puts it access to the diacritical manipulation of the light and of all of the ele ments which are differentiated therein with surgical precision 154 This eventuates in the compilation of lexicons of animated objects in the movement industries in the ability of digital technologies to recognize automatically different camera movements identical ob the digital the analog and the spectr al jects present in a film recurrent charactersall of which was first developed as he points out for the colorization of blackandwhite films To this must be added synthetic libraries of objects and move ments expressions sounds of morphing cloning embedding and capture which are crucial to the computergeneratedimage indus try and the process of digital rendering 157 For example as Mary Flanagan points out research teams working on earlier forms of the digitalization of movement used custom software to choose areas such as the mouth eyes and face of simple 2D photographs and    algorithms to mathematically control the 2D image In this way one can create inverse kinematic animation to simulate human move ment without parsing stream after stream of real user body data but the tradeoff is that a former whole is segmented proportioned and divided13 More recently such processes have given way to extremely so phisticated kinds of modeling that go far beyond even motioncapture technologies that render movement by means of mathematically plot ting data from sensors or markers placed on a moving body One par ticularly striking example of this new form of rendering reported in the New York Times on October 15 2006 is the work being done by Image Metrics Inc in California which uses software to map an actors per formance onto any character virtual or human living or dead While motion capture wires actors with small digital sensors and a newer technique called Contour tracks actors facial and body movements by coating them with phosphorescent powder Image Metrics starts with a generic model of the human head and layers onto that a mathe matical distillation of an individuals expressions IM thus solves the main problem with motion capture and standard computergenerated imagery CGIhow to convincingly render the eyes the inner part of the lips and the tongue The technique is remarkably convincing so much so that IMs chairman declares I like to call it soul transference The model has the actresss soul It shows through14 The Times reporter upon observing a demonstration at Image Metrics says that the computergenerated avatar appears to possess something ineffable something that seems to go beneath the skin and calls the effect of watching actress and computer model side by side more than a little bit creepy But what is creepy here I would suggest the digital the analog and the spectr al is the presumption of the images transparency and exhaustibility that there is nothing hidden to renderingnot even the soul Or as Stiegler puts it the machine sees planes detects them automatically mechanically Because it neither believes nor knows anything it isnt afraid of any defect it isnt haunted by any ghosts15 It is the restora tion of those ghosts that the ByrneEno project engages in and I mean project here in the broadest sense not just the record My Life in the Bush of Ghosts but also the visual art elements associated with it album covers etc and beyond that Brian Enos own video works What is particularly interesting howeverand here we can begin to appreciate the full resonance of the line from Hamlet that Derrida seizes on The time is out of jointis that the ByrneEno project engages in that restoration or reanimation before the advent of the pervasive digitalization of media In fact as has been widely noted My Life in the Bush of Ghosts engages in what would come to For the Emily Project Image Metrics animated a photorealistic CG face of the actress Emily OBrien and applied it to the real version of her body Courtesy of Image Metrics Ltd the digital the analog and the spectr al be known as sampling before sampling had really become a wide spread practice much less a codified term As Byrne points out in his Ghosts liner the digital the analog and the spectr al on the screen would be infinitely multiplied And by fussing with the color setting on the backs of the TV sets one could saturate and skew the color quite a bit I also took some pictures of just skewed vortexes and whorls of color and then we did some images where we skewed the color on pictures that had been taken of ourselves and then took polaroids of the results Somehow    these techniques also seemed analogous to what we were doing on the record16 Indeed they are analogous for reasons that Enos descriptions of his own contemporaneous video paintings help to bring out Eno started out working with a Panasonic industrial video camera that he bought from a roadie for the band Foreigner who were working in an adjacent studio while Eno was producing the Talking Heads third album Fear of Music As he recounts it the camera had no automatic controls and the manual controls which were analog had extremely wide ranges and tolerances You could do absolutely mad things with this camera he recalls in fact it was very hard to do anything real istic with it Moreover shortly after he bought the camera he made David Byrne Polaroid photograph from My Life in the Bush of Ghosts sessions the digital the analog and the spectr al the mistake of leaving it on and pointing at the sky for four days which completely fried the tube But after that he says it produced the most magical results and responded to light and colour in a way no other camera did17 Similarly the discovery of his signature video format came about by serendipity After he got the camera he didnt have a tripod so he laid it on its side on the window sill with the lens pointed out toward the Manhattan skyline which meant he also had to turn the TV onto its side to read the image The result he recounts was an absolute breakthrough because suddenly the screen looked not like television but like painting And this was important for two reasons first you lose the reference to theatre and cinema associated with the television surface and format and this is important because in the proscenium format you expect narrative which entails among other things an entire formatting indeed calculation to use Derridas term of time and event And second as Eno realized years later when he attempted the same thing with digital TVs the distortion on the television screen Brian Eno still from Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan 198081 the digital the analog and the spectr al created by the horizontal scanlines enabled with the screen turned on its side a unique rainfall effect turning mere analog static into valu able atmosphere as it were18 Enos perceptive comments underscore an important fact what undoes the calculated formatting of narrative and time is the interplay of form and the cultural expectations elicited and reproduced by it as in the proscenium or screen format with what Gregory Bateson calls the real magnitudes of analog media it depends for its effects on the specific embodied positionality and movement of its components for example the proximity of the video camera to the television screen on which it creates feedback and distortion19 This means that analog is spooky or spectral for the regime of rendering because among other things it depends on the interplay of material forces and bodies in cluding even things like the weather it is not wholly subsumable or predictable by programs and schemata simply because the interplay of real magnitudes in spacetime is fundamentally and even inexhaustibly Brian Eno still from Thursday Afternoon 1984 the digital the analog and the spectr al contingent creating a reservoir of complexity and contingency that is in principle bottomless That is not to say however that the analog is the opposite or the real other of the digital that it haunts Rather the structure of any discretization any diacritical system is that of a trace in Derridas sensethe iterability in and through which it can function and only can function as a medium and archive hence my earlier emphasis on interplay As Derrida puts it in a passage I have invoked more than once in this study this pure difference which constitutes the selfpresence of the living present introduces into selfpresence from the beginning all the impurity putatively excluded from it And what this means in turn is that the trace is the intimate relation of the liv ing present to its outside the opening to exteriority in general20 Such is the corrupting and contaminating workbut also the haunting or spectral character if you willof iterability which thus entails the necessity of thinking at once both the rule and the event concept and singularity that marks the essential and ideal limit of all pure ideali zation but not as the concept of nonideality as idealitys pure other In this sense as Derrida puts it remains heterogeneous to rather than simply opposed to the order of the ideal and the calculablethat is to say to the realm of grammaticalization and discretization21 The ana log in short does not exist as a presence a substance an as such or the the of the body What this means as I suggested in chapter 3 is that in Derridas words teletechnology and finally tekhné generally prohibits us more than ever    from opposing presence to its representation real time to deferred time effectivity to its simulacrum the living to the nonliving in short the living to the livingdead of its ghosts22 This unmappable difference impels us in turn beyond present life    its empirical or ontological actuality not toward death but toward a livingon survie namely a trace of which life and death would them selves be but traces    a survival whose possibility in advance comes to disjoin or disadjust the identity to itself of the living present23 The living present in other words is haunted by the ghosts or specters of what will have been once any kind of archive analog or digital or the most fundamental archive of all language itself in the broad est sense of a dynamic semiosis that as we saw in chapters 3 and 4 the digital the analog and the spectr al encompasses language proper and is in no way reducible to itis ac tivated It is spectral Derrida holds because we know that once it has been taken captured this image will be reproducible in our ab sence because we know this already we are already haunted by this future which brings our death Our disappearance is already here24 The logic of the specter he continues thus regularly exceeds all the oppositions between visible and invisible both phenomenal and nonphenomenal a trace that marks the present with its absence in ad vance 117 In short the analog never manifests itself as a purity a presence or an ideality Far from being a kind fatalism or necrophilia however it is pre cisely in this fact that futurity itself residesthe fact that the words we record now the images we make now will be iterable in our absence and indeed in the absence of any empirical being currently alive in the living present We are spectralized by the shot as Derrida puts it captured or possessed by spectrality in advance 117 but such is the price of a futurity in which our media our archives are to be legible in our absence And here the logic of spectrality shades over in Derridas work into the question of the messianicwe die so that they the future ones may livebut it is as he puts it a messianism without a messiah since after all that future and the ones who live it to whom we reach out may not come to pass It is not guaranteed in other words and that is precisely what makes it an ethical act an act of faith25 As Derrida puts it a messianism without guarantees without a particular incarnation of the messianic might elicit despair in some but without this latter despair and if one could count on what is com ing hope would be but the calculation of a program    Some and I do not exclude myself will find this despairing messianism has a curi ous taste a taste of death26 All of which provides a context for understanding the inadequacy in a way the backwardnessof the often observed and lamented fact about digital media that as Raley puts it telepresence absorbs im mediate presence and produces distance27 But Derridas pointand it would lead us eventually to the observation that David Wills makes about the almost Platonic lament that sometimes characterizes Paul Virilios discourse28is that the deadening or derealization typi cally associated with digital technologies versus the ontological um the digital the analog and the spectr al bilical cord of analog is always already in play with any form of repre sentation any semiosis whether of the word or the image Indeed the human is itself a prosthetic being who from day one is constituted as human by its coevolution with and coconstitution by external archival technologies of various kindsincluding language itself as the first ar chive and prosthesis As Wills puts it we have here in the insights of Derrida and Stiegler an investment in forms of exterior memory that will continue all the way to the computer revolution of the end of the twentieth century The upright hominid stance inscribes a definition of the human that is utterly determined by the idea of exteriorisation the hand reach ing outside the body to enter into a prosthetic relation with a tool the mouth producing or adopting the prosthetic device that is language As a result the archive is born the human species begins to develop a memory bank and its relation to time begins to be catalogued by means of the traces of an artificial memorythe artefact the narrative29 In other words there is no immediate presence From this vantage instead of what Wills calls the Promethean melancholy that the deadening or distancing effect of technology often elicits we might view it instead as a source of creationand not just from a Derridean point of view Indeed it is this distancing that makes possiblemakes unavoidablethe recursivity and folding that is key to the emergence of the virtual the movement that Derrida long ago dubbed the temporization and spacing endemic to the dynamics of the trace In this sense we would certainly agreeto lace together now the ideas of Derrida with those of Deleuzewith Brian Massumis assertion that nothing is more destructive for the thinking and imaging of the virtual than equating it with the digital30 Or more precisely the economy of the iterative trace which as Derrida puts it has to be extended to the entire field of the living or rather to the life death relation beyond the anthropological limits of spoken language31 would itself instance what Massumi imagines as a kind of encompass ing of the digital by analogic process in which what is coded is re cursivity    The digital processing becomes selfmodulating the run ning of the code induces qualitative transformation in its own loopy operation Against this background we can more fully appreciate the digital the analog and the spectr al Massumis observation that images of the virtual make the virtual appear not in their content or form but in fleeting in their sequencing or sampling The appearance of the virtual is in the twists and folds of formed content in the movement from one sample to another32 In a sense then the logic of the virtual is the logic of sampling itself a sam pling that is always leaving its source by the time it reaches us always in the process of vanishing This is directly related I think to the power of the voice and of the vocal tracks on My Life in the Bush of Ghosts As Stiegler the digital the analog and the spectr al conditionand it is in the end for Derrida both an ethical and political conditiondescribed by Roland Barthes in A Lovers Discourse It is characteristic of the voice to die What constitutes the voice is what within it lacerates me by dint of having to die as if it were once and never could be anything but a memory This phantom being of the voice is what is dying out it is that sonorous texture which disintegrates and disappears35 In short what makes the voice the voice is not that it is presence as the philosophical tradition tropes it according to Derrida but that it is spectral One might argue that the fact of the permanence of the recorded voice meets this objection but as we have already seen the recorded voice precisely in its repeatability and iterability only testifies all the more to the radical absence of every empirically deter minable subject to use Derridas phrase to the becomingghost of its origin in a bush of virtuality that its own ability to be sampled feeds and populates To put it another way My Life in the Bush of Ghosts abstracts the vocal material from its original anthropological religious or politi cal context but only the better to underscore its strangeness not an Orientalism or exoticism but a musicality and exteriority that exceeds intention denotation and sense confronting the listener with his or her own nonknowledge in the face of what Byrne called these trans missions from a desperate planet36 Hence the resistance of the voice in My Life in the Bush of Ghosts to the regime of rendering its gram maticalization and discretization is not provided by any kind of es sentialism or clinging to identity or origins Rather we would do well to recall Byrnes observation that at the time some people found this use of found vocal material disturbing and even repulsive because he wrote they would prefer to see music as an expression of emo tion    to believe in the artist as someone with something to say a queasiness connected with the idea of authenticity that as he the digital the analog and the spectr al immersed in similar work on the French Ocora label the idea was to make the record and try to pass it off anonymously as the genuine ar ticle And even though Byrne writes they eventually abandoned the imaginaryculturalartifact idea    I suspect this fantasy continued to guide us in a subconscious way37 All of that does not mean however nonserious In fact the po litical and ethical dimensions of that subconscious fantasy might be teased out by way of Richard Beardsworths observation that it is the lack of identity and ideality of any we of any community whatsoeverthe fact that strictly speaking we are irreducibly and inexhaustibly hetero geneous and different even to ourselves of course what else does the concept of the unconscious name in another theoretical vocabulary that will have returned from the beginning to haunt any determina tion of the community In this sense the weincluding the we of incipient globalization and its expression in digitalization that ani mates the ByrneEno project and its legion of voicemarks the ex cess of time over human organization38 It marks the subjection of any we to the alterity and radical otherness of time This lack of an essential identity is all the more apparent in contemporary society in which any country any locality determines its understanding of time place and community in relation to this process of global spectraliza tion 146a process that itself depends directly on the teletechnol gies and digitalization of memorysupport systems 147 that make it possible for such disparate communities to come into nonknowl edge of each other at an everaccelerating rate a process in which as Beardsworth puts it the real time of teletechnologies risks reducing the différance of time or the aporia of time to an experience of time that forgets time 148 And hereto cast a backward glance for a momentwe should remember once more Enos intense valuation of slowness and nonnarratological time in his video work As we saw at the end of chapter 3 what this means as Derrida ar gues is that in being spectralized by the mediumwhose maximum thematization is the alienating and distancing effect attributed to the digitalthe other comes first always first as he is fond of putting it This is why I am an inheritor the other comes before me39 The point here in other words is not just that the human is not reduc ible to its Pixarization via digital mass media whose aural equivalent the digital the analog and the spectr al would be that everyone would speak in the same synthesized voice The point is that what transcends that reduction and schematization is not a substance content presence or placenot in short an onto logical or anthropological authenticitybut rather a beyond as in Byrnes voices from another planet that is at the same time radically intimate a beyond that is not in Derridas terms a place In short the transcendent must be rethought as the virtual Such a line of argument would eventually lead us to Derridas sense of the messianic in relation to the spectral but therefore to a mes sianic without messianism without content or assurancein short to the livingon of a futurity to come without guarantees40 But it also leads us backor forwardto the odd temporal dislocation the asyn chronicity of the living present with itself remarked on by Eno in his reflections on his video piece Mistaken Memories of Medieval Manhattan They evoke in me a sense of what could have been and hence gener ate a nostalgia for a different future It is as though I am extracting from this reality the one the camera is pointed at the seeds of another Video Paintings liner

Made Flesh Embodying Information New York Routledge 2004 123 There they offer a useful reconceptualization of the concept of the body and counterpose it to four widespread understandings of the term the naturalist body the culturalsocial determinist body the animal body and the phe nomenological body 36 As they put it We propose that the body be understood as anything that cannot be divided without changing the fundamental pattern of its dynamics Thus bodies are made up of organs tissues cells and molecules but a description of a body cannot be reduced to a description of the parts or their functions This broad definition brings with it some surprising conclusions Machinic systems as popularized by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari may not be sets but they are bod ies An autopoietic system in the terms of Varela and Maturana is most definitely a body A selfreferential system in the terms outlined by Niklas Luhmann is a body A network as described by Manuel Castells is a body An organism bounded by flesh is a body    Moreover this understanding of the body allows us to distinguish between human and nonhuman bod ies without falling into the error diagnosed by HansUlrich Gumbrecht of employing a concept of the human that excludes    any reference to the human body 45 37 For a point of comparison here see Brian Massumis rather different Bergsoninflected

    ns1:text "Chapter 1 philosophy has become suspicious of claims about human subjectivity Those subjects who were historically considered aberrant and our future lives becoming increasingly hybrid show we have always been and are continuously transforming into posthumans What are the ethical considerations of thinking the posthuman creates new imaginative ways of understanding relations between lives Ethics is a practice of activist adaptive and creative interaction which avoids claims to overarching moral structures Inherent in thinking posthuman ethics is the status of bodies as the site of lives inextricable from philosophy thought experiments in being and fantasies of the future Posthuman Ethics examines certain kinds of bodies to think new relations that offer liberty and a contemplation of the practices of power which have been exerted upon bodies operations of knowledge power and majoritarian systems Michel Foucault states I wonder whether before one poses the question of ideology it wouldnt be Pore PateriaOist to stud first the Tuestion of the bod and the effeFts of Sower on it 1980 58 Posthuman Ethics could have been called Posthuman Bodies in reference to the crucial status of bodies in posthuman philosophy The body reFonfiJurinJ reOation and ethiFaO ePerJenFes of bodies beond beinJ reFeiYed through representation external and within consciousness negotiating reality through representative perception is the foundation and the site of the event of the SosthuPan enFounter 7houJht and Àesh the distanFe between bodies and ethics constituted through aesthetics are three trajectories along which Posthuman expression and force by encounters with and events of alterity Benedict Spinozas ethics directly challenges the Cartesian necessitation of the bifurcation between mind and body which act upon each other in turn Whichever turn precedes the other their alienation is complete and thus the distribution from internal body to the body of the polis as the state imposing upon docile bodies and obedient or resistant bodies acting upon the state failed to account for some basic but foundational tenets of the posthuman that there is no body without the mind and that they are not separate because they are not separate they cannot be ordered hierarchically that the mind as corporeal thus proves consciousness is not given thereby will and affects are never entirely accounted for predictable or discrete Posthuman Ethics FaSaFit for eSerienFinJ Pore and Oess benefiFiaO affeFts and deJrees of aSSetite In Spinoza will comes from the mind appetite from the body but these are different ways of expressing the interactions which occur within and uniquely for each thing The desire to persist is all that constitutes a thing and that which makes the thing unlike any other which gives the thing its essence Between things there is no commonality except a harmony which enhances joy or exercises destruction further sSeFifiFit 7he endeaYour to eist defines the eistenFe of the thinJ but the nature of its existence is not transparent Taking the central notion of desire around which much Continental Philosophy resonates will of the mind  at once clear distinct and confused  and appetite of the body is in fact nothing else but mans essence from the nature of which necessarily follow all the results which tend to its preservation  further between appetite and desire there is no difference  whatever increases or diminishes helps or hinders the power of activity in our body the idea thereof increases or diminishes helps or hinders the power of thought in our mind Spinoza 1957 36 Gilles Deleuze summarizes Spinozas contribution by stating what is action in the mind is necessarily an action in the body as well and what is a passion in the body is necessarily a passion in the mind There is no primacy of one series over the other Deleuze 1988b 18 A things essence comes from its capacity to act as a form of preservation Preservation is developed by a things sustenance of its essence Preservation is essence and the capacity to act the freedom of the thing as an inYoOution of Àesh and Pind 7he tendenF to SreserYation is what Pakes eaFh thing a singular event of life but preservation is of life alone over its inherent nature or quality Preservation is active as expressive and is separate from any notion of the preservation of a things sameness to itself For Spinoza thought is a things power to increase that is to alter transform develop and expand so the differentiation of the thing directly correlates with its liberty Ethics as a system of relation makes each things essence come from preservation irreducibly indeSendent froP FonfirPation of siPiOarit to itseOf at eaFh PoPent 7he Jift of liberty is allowing the power of the other to expand toward unknown futures To diminish the others capacity to multiply and extend its capacities is in Spinoza hate Hate is a form of pleasure  he who conceives the object of his hate is destroyed will feel pleasure 1957 41 Thus all force both love and hate is desire And all force is affect1 But further Posthuman Ethics will base ethics on 1 Seigworth points to the mistranslation of affect which in most English editions of Spinoza translations is emotion He describes the failure of singular emotion to account for affectio and affectus and then the soul which from two to three become multitudinous affeFtiYit 1 as desFribed b eOeue 6Sinoa defines desire froP whiFh aOO affeFts come as already at least three by which all other emotions arise 1957 37 It is clear Posthuman Ethics the premise that all conception is hateful ethics in a deliberate truncated reading of Spinozas claim this book will claim that he who conceives the object destroys the object imposing a claim upon a body conditional on monodirectional exertions of perception as conception limiting expressivity without limit Ethical encounters are different to Kants morality of benevolent totalizing ascension without TuaOifiFation for whiFh aesthetiFs and thereb a Fertain definition of representation and perception is responsible The distance even though unknowable between things by which Kant and Hegel operate even taking into account Hegels criticism of Kants claim natural beauty is co equivalent with spiritual and artistic is closed with Spinozas intimacy of organisms liberated or oppressed by expression of the other by the self and the openings to joy which seek to expand through thought without knowledge2 Serres opposes perception as a war waged against creation as an act of love The text on perception ends with conception Serres 2000 3839 Further to this Spinoza says the world would be much happier if men were as fully able to keep silence as they are to speak 1957 30 original emphasis Bodies in inextricable proximity involve a threefold ethical consideration  the critique of the detrimental effect a claim to knowledge of another body perpetrates address as creative expressivity opening the capacity for the other to express acknowledgement and celebration of the diffiFuOt new assteP of bioreOations as an onJoinJ irresoOYabOe but ethiFaO for being so interactive mediative project of desire Fèlix Guattari calls this sense without signification 2011 59 a language of sensation between Unspoken Friendship As the colour of the human soul as well as the colour of human becomings and of cosmic magics affects remain hazy atmospheric and nevertheless perfectly apprehensible to the extent that it is characterized by the existence of threshold effects and reversals in polarity Guattari 1996b 158 Just as Spinoza claims SerfeFtion is the finitude of the huPan Pind whereas µnature does not work with an end in view 1957 79 the liberated soul apprehends very well the perfection of something without needing to have made an exhausted judgement Perfection is found in encounters with the nature of things and their nature is their expansive quality that therefore expands the qualities of thought of we who encounter For Guattari this ethics of perfection comes from threshold effects The liminal encounter with the luminal body both expands a things expressivity and allows the other to be without finitude that is without knowOedJe diPinishinJ a thinJs capacity to preservation through its own essence free from the bondage of anothers Seigworth Deleuze and Spinoza each account for desire as expressivity power passion and action while attending to its inexhaustible and mysterious multiplicity and mobility 2 Primarily after Deleuze a new vitalistic triumverate of ethics has been developed of Spinoza Bergson and Nietzsche Posthuman Ethics claim to know that essence Ethical encounters with liminal bodies of which our own is also always one are good for both things It is an act of love between things based on their difference Thingness itself is hazy atmospheric and fuzzy but is connected with and belongs harmoniously to all other planes of expression To assuPe that there was a Sower of beinJ affeFted whiFh defined the Sower of beinJ affected of the whole universe is quite possible Deleuze 1997 9 Importantly Deleuze calls Spinozas a practical philosophy that is a philosophy of practice3 where ethics takes us away from the God toward which humanist PetaShsiFs asSires  be that FaSitaO OoJiF or reOiJious doJPa  toward the Àesh which constitutes life The posthuman as an ethical practice is a practice toward life itself or rather lives  real singular and connective uniquely emergent without predictable development and directly addressed lives for which we seek to expand the FaSaFit to eSress µ6Sinoa SroMeFts an iPaJe of the SositiYe affirPatiYe Oife which stands in opposition to the semblances that men are content with Deleuze 1988b 12 For humanisms compulsion to taxonomy and hierarchy in science and religion philosophy and art semblance often emerges as resemblance The fieOd of SosthuPan thiFs deal with life which resembles nothing except itself and not consistent with itself temporally only tactically Posthuman ethics sees the dividuation of life in opposition to identity as it acknowledges the inevitable connection between living bodies as the point of ethical address and in a seeming postmodern conundrum the individual is constituted only by its connection to other individuals The connection is from where the ethical activation of the body is delivered from its place in the taxonomy atop which rides the human occurs No body without mind no individuality without connection no connection without another dividuated life with its own concomitant reality no affect without expression will as appetite beyond consciousness and perhaps most importantly no thought or theory without materiality Resonant with Spinozan ethics is Guattaris emphasis on the bod as site of PaFhiniF oSeration between knowOedJe and Àesh uattari FaOOs the act of interpretation or knowing a body the massacre of the body He writes It is the body and all the desires it produces that we wish to liberate from foreign domination It is on that ground that we wish to work for the liberation of society There is no boundary between the two elements I oppress myself inasmuch as that I is the product of a system of oppression that extends to all aspects of living  We can no longer allow others to turn

seOfknowinJ huPan with the infinite series of reOationaO forFes esirinJ bodies do not seek an object but as an ethics of desire interactive forces seek the best possible affects those which bring joy Liberty for the other is the joy of opening the others capacity for expression without conditional attribution of equivalent qualities which match the self or are subjugated through a failure of equivalence If deconstruction challenges and critiques the machines that occupy the territories of our aSSetiteÀesh then ethiFs seeks to resist that FoPSuOsion toward the other Maurice Blanchot describes ethics in this passivity that is constituted not by absence or powerlessness but friendship Against responsibility for the other that needs to know to what we are responsible friendship is the response without condition it is in friendship that I can respond a friendship unshared without reciprocity friendship for that which has passed leaving no trace This is passivitys response to the unpresence of the unknown Blanchot 1995 27 Passing and passivity evoke encounters beyond demand and within an absolute SresentSresenFe with a Fontet defiant of an SositiYeneJatiYe SossibiOit of ePerJent TuaOified SresenFe Must SresenFe as unSresenFe and thus SassiYit oSen to unknowability is the ethical activity of passivity Their subtle relation is of the coemergent and indivisible Describing passivity as active shows the dynamism of ethiFs and the Tuiet PaJnifiFenFe of JraFe harOes 6tiYaOes interSretation of force as affect states The force of this Blanchots unpredictable then would serve paradoxically as much as a potential for grasping the friends thought as it does to limit that accessibility 2008 72 Just as many Continental philosophers have associated creativity thought and subjectivity beond subMeFtifiFation with a kind of madness schizoanalysis delirium Blanchot states but when ethics goes mad in its turn as it must what does it contribute if not a safe conduct which allows our conduct no rights leaves us no space to move an ensures us of no salvation It allows only the endurance of a double patience for patience is double too  speakable unspeakable patience 1995 27 Posthuman Ethics share in Continental philosophys end of master and metanarrative discourse where the end of discourse opens up to life In as much as Posthuman Ethics are about certain forms of life they are ultimately about the end of speaking of life as the beginning of lives being ethically open to living Opening to bodies considered dehuman devolved aberrant or outside requires a speakable patience which speaks only its own patience The other is outside discourse therefore unspeakable Our own human need for rights to equal some kind of equality payoff which the other neither wants nor needs if it requires fuOfiOPent of huPan Friteria are our need not that of the other Blanchot points out that ethics is the madness of the doingnot doing of passivity of a certain kind as activism silence as allowing the other to be heard Posthuman Ethics attend to the turn in Continental philosophy that when we speak of the IOther we are speaking Posthuman Ethics of the self as its own othered multiplicity that dialectics have little relevance and opposition is discarded as inherent in the ethical turn The space between the I Other is one of inevitable connection and we are always and already othered otherable whether we belong to the bodies explored in Posthuman Ethics Indeed it must always be remembered while reading Posthuman Ethics that any and all Posthuman Ethics with which novelty may be introduced a need not to further established trajectories but multiply and fracture them a leap over a chasm for which no paths have yet been built toward a territory with which no one is familiar In this renegade movement post also interrogates its motives for moving  demarcating the blind spots in theory which are presumed unimportant or nonexistent acknowledging and reworking the conditions under which knowledges emerge decentring the homogenization and unifiFation of the orderinJ of ideas and SerFeiYed truths  deFonstruFtinJ the present and being the nomadic parentless destiny it refutes taxonomy genealogy and guaranteed futurity In its generative reconnective comings post seeks to disorder the ordering of thought converted to knowledge JeanFrançois Lyotards seminal The Postmodern Condition traces the critics of post in the case of postmodernism as crying out for a demand  the demand for a referent objective reality sense as transcendence addressor addressee and consensus 1984 73 What amalgamates the disparate critics and their various not necessarily commensurable demands is their need for order which expresses as desire for unity identity security and a consistent public perception 1984 73 A conundrum of post already arises here  the criticism of post is already postmodern in its disparity One of the tactics these FritiFs use is rather than stand and fiJht the OiTuidate the strenJths of the affeFts of postmodernisms commitment through mixing and merging postmodern experiments and creativity into a homogenous tepid dilution Lyotard cites the assimilation of the avantgarde heritage by transavantgardism as one example Again post conundrums emerge The mixing process Lyotard sees as destroying the avantgarde could be perceived as resonating with the mixing process post culture performs through some of its key buzzwords  bricolage hybridization multiplicity Lyotards is a crucial warninJ Yen in its disSarit FritiFs are unified eYen in the PuOtiSOiFities Freated through assimilation radicalism is diluted and unrecognisable even in a pseudo address through socalled new trans movements creativity is purged and even though the avantgarde has a heritage its temporality is neither genealogy nor linear This small example from Lyotard establishes a key premise of post  there is nothing necessarily post in posttheories and there is nothing inherently antipost in histories of thought In this way there is no time in post or rather post offers a different time Time continues to haunt theories of the post

SosthuPan At the beginning of this book  at the end of the book  283 my emphasis Some theorists doubly inverse post theory by their reinvention of and potentially nostalgia for humanism and modernism George Myerson sees ecopathology  a kind of committed new reason deconstructing the destruction of ecologies from earth to self  as a radical potential for an alternative modernism 56 original emphasis He titles his book Ecology and the End of Postmodernism Time is clearly a spectre which haunts post theories through our insistence on reversing Posthuman Ethics it in our posthuman futures what we seek to be we have already become and ending it in order to think anew through what we already thought we had ended While time is not a major theme of this book its persistence elucidates that in all criticisms of and questions about the now is the postmodern splintering of grand narratives that have been and importantly threaten to be This comes with the shocking realization that these narratives have always been postmodern in their disagreements and our post futures are not guaranteed to deliver us from unifying discourses but at worst smugly seduce us into seeing anything post as beyond what has been The ordering of things does not cease in our criticisms of it Time is not necessarily an important element of post theory but it seems an important element in how we think we should think about post theory4 From what hopes does this belief come Here is raised some of the not entirely definabOe definiteO nonehaustibOe SerFeiYed differenFes in definitions of the primary posts which concern posthuman theory While Hayles sees the posthuman as already been this should not vindicate or forget the irrefutable compulsion to a Yer sSeFifiF kind of futurit in SosthuPanisP naPeO what has FoPe to be called transhumanism Many cybertheorists and organizations such as Humanity formerly the World Transhumanist Organization which attempt to think transhumanist futurity such

chimera and the offspring that has no parents because its qualities do not conform to or obey the rules of the humanist discourse morally logically religiously phallocentrically reproductively Those who were the aberrations of society are now those the human seek to become The Haraway posthuman is a means to substantiate and anthropomorphise the technological other into something that can be embraced and embrace back in light of the building out of skill which characterizes technological development The resulting loss of consent which occurs only serves to highlight the incompleteness of our bodies  posthumanism places achieving our full humanity or full embodied awareness as conditional to our ability to understand our own inforPation the data that defines us  inforPation that Fan

transcendent intent not Spinozas conscious version of appetite is retrospective  the regulation of already established technologies  and antagonistic to Lyotards suggestion of an ethical time Fukayama like many posttheories reduces the future to the way the present deals with technologies already established  technically then the past  as directly and causally necessary as our only possible unfurling destiny Lyotard states obligation is not conditional but categorical nor does it condition Even when taken as an effect of pure will it cannot in turn be the cause of an effect of Posthuman Ethics an act for example which would result from it Causality through freedom is immediate that is without mediation but also without recurrence  it will be said You ought to awaits a sequel whether it is obedience or not and thus sketches out something possible to come or a future But this is also the case for many phrases of other regimens  for instance for cognitive phrases subjected to the procedure for establishing reality 1988 126 Post theorys manipulation of and confusion over time grapples with this way of thinking the future beyond prescription Dawne McCance explains The Differend deals with the problem of writing or speaking after that is without an JiYen ruOes   7iPe is an iPPanent now and the obOiJation to reÀeFtion about which one can never speak and the authenticity of which one cannot verify though speak and verify one must nonetheless do The event is not the axis but the definition of sSeeFh and YerifiFation PetaPorShose µ2ur 3osthuPan uture is somewhat anathema In posthuman theory we do have an obligation but it is never what we think it is because the ethical event cannot be known in advance Similarly we are not aware of what we are capable of Lyotards I am able to in reference to the obligationcapability event but Lyotard emphasizes pure ethical time obliges and enables one within the event of obligation  a singular and unique event  each in their own way This beautifully simple pure ethics of exceptional moment of the this one obligation as acknowledgement of and creativity toward connection coalesces will with ability thus refuting the idea of human will as coming from a consistent idea of humanness and subjectivity and obligation with condition which seems particularly apt in the posthuman terrain where we do not et know of what we are FaSabOe in sSeFifiF referenFe to the was in whiFh we emerge with and as technologies of unpredictable futures However and here is both Lyotards profound posthuman intervention and the premise of Posthuman Ethics this is already the case Each entity is already that will based on precise ability which cannot be transferred to another entity and which is never clear to the entity itself until the moment of the event of obligation which in turn has never before been witnessed or required The most primitive or ordinary bodies operate in ethical time as a time never been before which is a postmodern if not posthuman apprehension of duration as rupture over chronology Our anxieties about post theory come from their rapturous effect so more than displacements perhaps they are reminders of all the bodies and abilities of entities which the enlightenment transcendental essence and modernity have needed to repress in order to maintain the integrity of the phantasy of their completion a future which has not yet but will arrive Posthuman will after Lyotard is that which deestablishes the human as a site both of a certain reality and the way the concept of the human has been privileged in constituting all reality at the expense of those who do not count as human Ethical time resonates with post theories confusion but confusion creates a consistency of ethical creativity and surprise as accountable demand that is not reduced to right or wrong response correct operation of the awaited sequel obedience or disobedience or lament at non Posthuman Ethics foreclosure or resolution We do not know what will happen and how we will respond If posthuman theory has seen this as both a celebration and an anxiety then via Lyotards ethical time our celebration may be of incommensurabilities of entities including the incommensurability of an entity as to how it perceives itseOf as ÀourishinJ MubiOant diYersifinJ SotentiaOit and aniet as a hoSe for the best possible force and consequence of creating new openings which allow obligation events that access entities beyond their agreement with categories of the human Put simply if as Fukuyama suggests posthumanism is embraced as a power of human freedom 217 then we must ask what happens if we were not Founted as huPan in the first SOaFe In one sense Fukuyamas argument could not be further from posttheory His FonfiJuration of the bioteFhnoOoJiFaO huPan sees JoinJ beond the huPan as a huPan riJht huPan PodifiFation as an iPSeratiYe of beinJ an obedient suffiFient normal human and humans as inherently free thus freedom should focus on further freedom found in extension of capabilities and life Where Fukuyamas theories are post is that the only thing humans should be thinking about is how to not be mortal humans any longer by being eternal organisms In stating humans are nothing more than the freedom of force to shape what they are as a preordained template rather than Spinozas nonconscious preservation as essence his elliptical argument risks OoFatinJ itseOf in an address to huPan riJhts defined b those who haYe the riJht to define huPans b their FaSaFit to aOter theP 7he eYoOutionar iPSeratiYe of nonhuman animal

subjectivity and those who know best beinJ those who define that subMeFtiYit its OiPits and deYeOoSPent Where Lyotard asks to what end Miccoli suggests the more obvious critical posthuman answer would be to achieve full embodied awareness Miccoli 75 Miccolis argument is committed to an ethics of rights and his concept of bodily awareness is not transcendental humanism which happens to be trapped in or limited by a body Rather for him corporeality is simple and evident in that it is all we are and the very site where what we are is contested in brutal oppressive ways Full embodied awareness is absolutely present in Fukuyamas dream but as antagonistic to that dream  we must become posthuman so we can forget that aOO we are is Àesh that bodies Fan feeO FoOd Sain hunJer sufferinJ and uOtiPateO cease us to be Miccolis bodily awareness is not what a human body is but that it is and thus other humans have bodies which express and which affect each other Their essential qualities and nature do not make up bodily awareness but the devastatingly simple fact that we should be aware we are bodies is integral to thinking rights be they human or not Lyotards differend embodies the body Posthuman Ethics that cannot speak in the language of the master thus cannot be legitimized as a body If that body speaks in the masters language it concedes to the master ideology Fukuyama places the use of biotechnology in the hands of the state The minoritarian has no viable body in the eyes of the state Postmodernism demands multivocal languages be legitimized and far from making sure these many vocalities are heard it accepts understanding leads to legitimation through assimilation so the best we can do is our ethical best to negotiate for Lyotard through gaming multiplicity premised on misunderstanding as creativity between vocalities In terms of sharing humans share nothing beyond what they can hazard they might share which in decidedly posthuman ways they also share with elements and lives outside of what is considered human In this sense the posthuman is ethical because it sees the human category as a purpose rather than a thing and far from wanting to count as human posthuman ethics seeks to count everything in spite of and in order to liberate life from not the human or humanity but the effects of constituting manipulating and continuing the category taxonomy and genealogy of the human The central question what is the posthuman does not ask what it is We need a new verb as yet unthought The posthuman is everything that is not human but it is also a reason

not knowing what will be on the other side but knowing there is a reason to extend ones own side and remap the cartography of n dimensional nonEuclidean rhizomes Posthuman Ethics follows a theoretical trajectory which is mediative of but in other ways particular to new assemblages of ethical encounters with bodies and entities Immediately when one thinks ethics in a post world based on Continental philosophy Levinas is foregrounded For reasons elaborated below Levinas will not be utilized in Posthuman Ethics But this book will also heavily FritiTue other faYoured ShiOosoShers in order not to refute their inÀuentiaO and iPSortant Fontribution to the oeuYre but to offer a different FonfiJuration of ways in which certain assemblages and interpretations of ethics can liberate the alreadynothuman from the traps of human perception whether that perception is deliberate or incidental I am not suggesting this can be done and in some messianic way I am the one to do it Certain philosophers are more adamant in their attempts to challenge the inevitable operation of human perception especially those philosophers who are not afraid of giving up perception altogether without giving up interaction and mediation Just as Lyotards ethical time knows it can neither suFFeed nor faiO et Pust be eeFuted the tiPe of P FonfiJuration of philosophers and bodies is one which cannot predict its success and it is the very frightening imperative that is the reason for ethics itself Posthuman Ethics shows we cannot do ethics and evaluate whether something was as ethical or not as we would hope Perhaps this is why certain parts of the book may even seem mystical6 due to their abstraction which takes the posthuman like the ecstatic outside of time into a place of encounter with the imperceptible but materially affective outside Perhaps also this is why the book will be guilty of what Carey Wolfe states of That paradoxical observability of the unobservable the communicability of the incommunicable  which ought to sound familiar to students of romanticism xxxii Enter Foucault the romantic A manifest truth writes Foucault 6 Mystical is delivered in Posthuman Ethics from its religious associations While some have criticized mysticism as irretrievable from its sentimental Christian associations see Braidotti 2006 258 preferring terms such as spirituality Posthuman Ethics will attempt to express mysticism as a secular cosmic force Posthuman Ethics but when one begins to detect the very conditions that made it seem manifest the familiarities that served as its support the darknesses that bought about its clarity and all those far away things that secretly sustained it and made it go without saying 1994 447 Foucaults claim balances the wonder of the Romantic imperceptible embracing Outside with the required acknowledgement that the way reality is constituted and b whoP is a Àawed resuOt of reJiPes of Sower and PasTuerades of obserYabOe exteriority Wolfe tends toward Jacques Derrida Judith Butler Bruno Latour and what could be argued a more American theoretical framework Wolfe in his discussion of the place of ethics in posthuman theory explores the status of biotechnology and media in the United States now and this direct application is itself an ethical turn in its material encounter with issues of obligation neither judgemental as I perhaps am nor unconditionally celebratory Many other posthuman theorists tend toward Levinas Derrida Latour Haraway and Hayles while interestingly those theorists who are more aligned with my framework such as Rosi Braidotti Anna HickeyMoody Elizabeth Grosz Claire Colebrook and Felicity Colman seem to shy away from posthuman theory or are more critical of it7 emphasizing French feminism and the Nietzschian Bergsonian Spinozist and DeleizioGuattarian line Posthuman Ethics as a FoPPitted work on Àesh and embodiment as a prime site of contestation in a posthuman world does not resoOYe the disSarate tendenFies but does take a Yer sSeFifiF interSretation of the posthuman  those who were already not quite human  and argues it is these bodies which are the matter of another way to think posthumanism In reference to the Romantic turn in posthumanism once again time emerges as an issue and the time and geography of various movements create their own SroduFtiYe ruStures and fissures nne einstones Avatar Bodies 2004 is one of the many posthuman texts which exploits the mobility of the concept to bring in seemingly unrelatable elements  here ancient Eastern ideology or theology  to create what she calls an esoteric and exoteric spiritual posthumanism It does not resound with Orientalist fetishism but acknowledges and delights in its development of proximities of ideas that may be considered with less sympathy by those who wish to maintain a semblance of discursive discretion Romanticism does share consistencies with posthuman theory especially via Foucault Deleuze and Guattari Bataille and other key theorists for Posthuman Ethics but chronology has been perverted so this cannot be a criticism Mysticism esoteric and other philosophical blasphemies populate Posthuman Ethics but like avatar bodies it is hoped it will be no less philosophical for doing so Returning to the question of why not Levinas Weinstone calls him the philosopher of no contact par 7 Coincidence or epistemic training may be to blame but these as myself are all Australian feminist theorists For more on this phenomenon see MacCormack Patricia 2009 Feminist Becomings Hybrid Feminism and Haecceitic Reproduction Posthuman Ethics excellence 153 Evoking the transhuman Barry Rutland 2004 suggests the postmodern ethical subject is a transject Yet as Levinas he remains committed to the ethical as responsorial based on the address of the obligation as a demand coming from the face As privileged plane of subjectivity even and increasingly in posthuman theory animal subjectivity the face makes an ethics based on difference incommensurability and imperceptibility impossible Simultaneous with the issue of time Levinas work raises the issue of space Posthuman ethics is a negotiation of distance in the ways relation is structured or destructured If an entity can face another entity it can perceive that entity as not it not part of it and so constituted as perceived by it Levinasian ethics offer many features of postmodern philosophys readdressing of encounters with alterity His claim that transcendence comes from the encounter being based on the fact one can SerFeiYe another without noPenFOature of the other  that the other is suffiFient enough to count by virtue of being recalls a kind of almost phenomenological differend eYinas defies ethiFs based on eTuiYaOenFe and FonYersion is refusaO of FhronoFentriF FausaOit in the µfaFe of the iPPanent infinite at the encounter of the other is an ethics of time and certainly verges on mysticism as Posthuman Ethics does 7he Pain reason eYinas Fannot be Mustified as inteJraO to posthuman ethics is what or whom he considers as counting The very question of whatwho counts or more precisely never asking for the what or who is what underpins this book Whether one validates Levinas counting other or negotiates it to further inFOude others that Pa Fount this is stiOO a nuanFed and refined but nonetheless exclusory ethics of external other even while one loses subjectivity by placing the self in the position of the other 141 It would be ridiculous to write Levinas off and I do not do so but there are ways in which his work diverges from ethical posthuman encounters I would not claim any of those theorists who do inspire Posthuman Ethics would be any better should they be interrogated in reference to for example difference feminism or abolitionist animal rights but theory is for post theory what one makes of it and doing theory is creating theor in SosthuPanisP where Àesh and thouJht aFtiYisP and ShiOosoSh are not bifurcated For this reason Continental philosophy corporeal feminism and ecosophical experimentation refutes Baxis understandable anxiety that Theory remains a suspect term for many social movement and activist folk IX She defines theor as a µtask of anaOsis  diYided into SroduFers and FonsuPers This creates a false diachrony between theorypractice or theoristsactivists Baxi arJues

theoryactivism by the perilous but compelling task to act with theory and theorize with activism Again we return to the system of relations which is reoriented in DeleuzianSpinozan ethics Deleuze explicates Spinozan ethics through the concept of common notions In short a common notion is the representation of a composition between two or more bodies and a unity of this composition  For when we encounter a body Posthuman Ethics that agrees with ours we experience an affect or feeling of joypassion although we do not adequately know what it has in common with us 1988b 55 56 If affects are the becoming inhuman of man Deleuze and Guattari 1994 169 then man must pass through inhumanity toward ethics Crucial to Deleuzes definition of ethiFs borne of FoPPon notions is that eaFh eOePent or entit does not FoPe to the reOation aOread fied in their TuaOities whiFh wiOO therefore either be or not be clearly commensurable with the other Deleuze emphasizes that a defininJ eOePent of the eSerienFinJ

Sositions and anneations to reOiabOe siJnifiFations but there is also anxiety in jubilance trepidation in liberty and in the cliché of fear of the unknown the fear is as exhilarating and creative as the jubilance is frightening by facilitating an encounter with a beyond Jubilant may sound idealistic and redemptive anxiety a kind of capital hysteria The passions and affects of ethics Posthuman Ethics are extensive rather than leap to overcome them we reel in that we thought we should avoid because especially for the oppressed other there is no luxurious avoidance of diminishing affects The aim is aimless the act matters and the matter of the ethics Oterit and oSenness reOinTuishinJ reOianFe on Sreeistent siJnifiers to beFoPe Oost in the Àows of affeFtiYit are essentiaO to ethiFaO

mobile affectivity of forces which interact as a mediation of desire and where passion and joy come from the notknowable of self or other Yet it is problematic to offer this constitution of ethics as an exploratory future without a social contextualization of the effects of powers of discourse on others in history Just as good ethics seeks to enhance joy and passions so bad ethics emphasizes those affects which exhaust or enclose the other exacerbating their capacity to eSress n terPs of reÀeFtions on sSeFifiF entities whose FaSaFit to effeFt haYe been oppressed through signifying systems the bodies and entities in Posthuman Ethics have been selected for their being at and as the limit of address This page has been left blank intentionally Chapter 2 The Great Ephemeral Tattooed Skin Tattooings capacity to make philosophy readdress issues of bodies as intensity and momentum is where its contestation of sites of power is oriented Deleuze and Guattari claim Paintings tattoos or marks on the skin embrace the multidimensionality of bodies 1987 176 Open thought about the affect of bodies that scatters and fragments is a call to a new dermal vocabulary which embraces the

tattooing Yet tattooing itself is as complex as any other form of creativity in that motivation is not clear The question could be turned from Why does one tattoo ones body to Why do we want to know why we or another tattoos Lyotard states To ask someone a question is to presuppose that the person understands it and wants to reply  do we ask this question about ourselves Or else they will not

think the body temporally through an act that is most frequently described as a permanent marking of the skin Even if we see a tattooed body as an affective body it is taken traditionally as a spatial

Unfeminine women or rebellious women who tattoo themselves to create their own visual or aesthetic representation may seem to resist traditional versions of femininity Covertly female tattooist Vyvyn Lazonga describes tattoos as another plane of the traditional ornamentation of women Women are masters of illusion They always have been with clothes and makeup A tattoo is just part of that illusion in Juno and Vale 1989 126 But neither the concept of the feminine woman taking performance to an extreme nor that of the rebellious woman give the female body the volition of discursive

denied access to enunciation of self Does this mean that based on Lazongas statement a tattooed woman is always and already becoming If the female body is thought as a BwO then where and what is tattooed upon it is by turns irrelevant contingent in meaning or a form of increasing the intensity of the BwO Does a tattooed male enter a becoming woman because tattoos pleat the orJanisPsiJnifinJ

majoritarian investment of the body as organized even if that body creates a new plane of interest by being tattooed The organization of the body assists in interpreting tattoos as much as tattoos

Perhaps one could say while Deleuze and Guattari ask how do we make ourselves a Body without Organs particularly in the chapter Economy of this Writing Lyotards Libidinal Economy asks how do we make philosophy a BwO In this chapter I have attempted to show both that tattooing is a radicalizing of the skin and the skin itself is a point where philosophy and our relationship with the world can be radicalized in reference to difference especially gender Tattooing incites provokes hopefully in a way that further multiplies differenFes between and within bodies f this is so then the

8 that tattoos are now equivalent to clothes because they can be removed by laser is misguided Economically laser removal is far more expensive than being tattooed and the large expense of tattoos themselves is seen as disproportionate with their cultural value in spite of their being akin to art over clothes Laser removal is intensely painful and frequently leaves severe raised scars in the form of keloids Tattooed skin belongs to a more surgical more visceral and I would argue after Hardt and Negri more contested interface with the world than do clothes Optimistically I would suggest that because traditional forces are reactive to the affect of tattooing tattooing represents a form of active force This activity comes from the bodys reaction to cultural restrictions in reference to

rethink science philosophy and art as always including an I do not know that is positive and creative the condition of creation itself and that consists in determining by what one does not know 1994 128 This chapter will discuss ways in which the artperceiver encounter may be rethought Persistent questions of structuralism and poststructural theory  what are ways of seeing ways of reading ways of listening  in posthuman ethics show there are no ways But poststructuralisms questions do not become defunct Insofar as posthumanism shows the very questions themselves demand answers the polyvocality the questions presume is inherent in posthumans multiplicities and proliferative affects The death of the authorartist and the ensuing death of the reader can lead to a nonnihilistic vitalism that maintains an ethical nonsubject Arts capacity for fabulation and expression impossible in and not identically transferable to the real world is why we love art and why it is and makes inhumanness or what I will in this chapter call ahumanity huPanit differs froP the SosthuPan or is a Pore sSeFifiF forP of SosthuPan relation in that it takes as its catalyst the very amorphous obviously problematic but for theorists of both poststructuralism and transcendent attainment of human SerfeFtion a tSe of Patter FonfiJured in a uniTue wa b what is residuaOO FaOOed the human By this I mean and each of the following words could be placed in quote marks to illustrate their tentative use things created by human organisms Posthuman Ethics that are intended to be something formed by and external to the human that then attempt to return to an involution with the human to alter their being with a hope to depending on which theoretical trajectory one follows variously ignite becomings and encounters with the outside or quicken the base human organism toward a more perfected cultural phenomenon to selfrealization to God and so forth The inhuman is the version of the posthuman created by an encounter with a plane of matter formed of human thought converted to a nonliving thing whatever thingness may mean within disparate philosophies Even though nonliving the art has µOife throuJh its eSressiYit uniTue with eaFh affeFtiYe infinitesiPaO PoPent of relation It becomes clear that in the context of certain art theory which aspires to catalyse becominginhuman that the very category and premise of what it means to call something art is dubious All art is viable to the extent that it is more or less affective to each immanent moment of each art acolyte Perhaps inevitably in a posthuman context art will develop a term to refer to its own life very differently I would very much seek and welcome a new kind of terminology to refer to what we think as art but for now because there is no vocabulary of and for arts thingness in a posthuman context and to develop one reducibly would be anathema to the very problem all that can be offered in the context of Posthuman Ethics is that humans can create things through recombining matter that are independent of epistemes which support the valuation of use based on production as reproduction Art is for capitalism useless when it makes us inhuman but useful in posthuman ethical thouJht 7o define what art is is a frustratinJO iPSossibOe task but worth for ethiFaO theory Yet it is something and this chapter by describing these silent invisible encounters will coalesce the I do not know what art is with the not knowing art creates inhuman ecstasies The inhuman is created through arts inhumanity Art is however different to the creativity of events which are constituted through the subsequent posthuman encounters in this book The following chapters on nonhuman animals congenital and other nonself stylized monsters desire as inherent to though not exclusively the human organism and the irrefutability of death are all what could be termed natural combinations of matter with which humans have an ambiguous inevitable relation Arts is less natural in degree in that its inevitability in the world is a diminished one in comparison to others due to it being after the human creator This makes no claims to authorship intent or expected affect Just that art could be described as something that was not there in a particular combination before a human manipulated it but crucially it was a non OiYinJ set of PateriaOs infiniteO different froP nonFonsensuaO orJanisPs suFh as animal intervened with the cured monster or the making dead of lives We do not know what art is but its role within a posthuman ethical relation gives it its thingness without being an external representing object Rancière emphasizes that art is no longer representative in two ways The first is that froP an ethiFaO SersSeFtiYe in FataOinJ our SosthuPan beFoPinJs art should represent what is unrepresentable bearing witness to the unspeakable that is in excess of language and to which conversion to language refuses bearing witness by inserting unspeakable art into a register or lexicon that by virtue of this Art Inhuman Ecstasy inclusion imagines all art represents and all unspeakable acts are representable thereby they cannot be described as inhuman When initially Rancière orients inhuman art around the forsaking of the Other that dehumanizes and therefore demands representation in order to verify the need to bear witness a doubling occurs which shows that inhuman art comes from the dehumanization of subjects and this inhumanity is necessary in order for certain lives to not be excluded The lesson we learn from inhuman art  the art of the unrepresentable and unspeakable  is that maintaining human perception coming from human subjectivity is unethical Those who cannot be converted to description and representation are excluded Rather than selecting equality as a raising up of the Other to representability Rancière after Lyotard claims arts responsibility is to resist the human perception that creates unspeakable acts These are the two heterogeneous logics which overlap An intrinsic logic of the possibilities of the possibilities and iPSossibiOities sSeFifiF to a reJiPe of art and an ethiFaO denunFiation of the Yer ShenoPenon of reSresentation 5anFiqre  11  7he definition of ethiFaO art is the obligation to present the unrepresentable to catalyse thought impossible for the human subject to recognize make sense of and master The onus is neither on the artwork nor the mythologized intent of the artist but the subjects witnesss coming toward or path taken For this reason this chapter will explicitly aYoid referenFinJ sSeFifiF works of art and further what Fonstitute an artistiF Jenre hiOe Post iPPediateO art is assoFiated with fine art Oiterature PusiF and so forth it can also include bodies movements and experiences considered ordinary in ones day Deleuze and Guattari state of two forms of oil painting The distinction clearly does not come down to representational or not since no art and no sensation haYe eYer been reSresentationaO n the first Fase sensation is realized in the material and does not exist outside its realization 1994 193 In this sense each event of art from its genre to material object status is no more than the singular encounter that realizes it Anything which elicits an inevitable rupture of consistencies of perception can in this formulation be referred to as art The rupture is limited only to the extent that it catches us up in a moment which is I will argue not a dialectic but an ecstatic event Desire for art is an ethical tactic of apprehension Ethics demands an address to relations of difference which will necessarily dismantle and reform the subject and thus desire for art is ethical to the extent that the perceiver mobilises subjective transformation In thinking the inhuman encounter with art key topics are challenged the neJotiation of desFriStiYe and reÀeFtiYe sSeeFh whiFh Fonstitutes SossibiOities of ways of

in ethics that we need art The Inner Inhuman This chapter utilizes terms such as catalyst and work to describe the art object which creates the event as the encounter with the outside The outside after Maurice Blanchot and Foucault no longer sees counting as human as crucial or ethical in perceiving art The outside involves the disintegration of the I who speaks in speaking about The I speak belongs to a sovereign language The speaker that dissolves in art in Foucaults description literature proliferates language language getting as far away from itself as possible  leading us by way of other paths to the outside in which the speaking subject disappears 1987 12 13 Art need not resonate with the human world to succeed The ahuman planes into which art launches us are outside we bear

while in inextricable and univocal emergence with each other Here are at least four preliminary pleats2 which of course are n pleats Even if the veil is one blanket which covers the secret relation between self and workelementother it lacks the hard corners and JeoPetriFaO rationaOiation of the struFture t is defined b Fontours and tetures adjectives not the noun which is populated by other nouns of which the self and other are just two more Crucially the veil is not removable It is also not fused The veil is the condition of possibility of the beneath which is in turn what creates the veils tantalizing offer It must be understood as both separate and incapable of being removed It holds no promise of revelation of the relation While traditional encounters with art offer the theatre of revelation of meaning as a promise for repetition the veiled relation does not offer those beneath perception of sensations and affects The theatre of the art encounters players are binarised The perceiver and its other risk becoming equivalent to any other biunivocal subject dialectic beginning with active interpreter and passive work The compulsion to remove the veil to reveal the relation slaughters desire sense and event All dualism does is reveal a ghost facing a skeleton Serres 2008 25 The skeleton is the perceiver 1 The use of the article is for grammatical clarity Calling outside

expression resonates with Deleuzes work on Leibniz but in The Five Senses Serres maintains an address to constructed evententities that tends toward more material and even ordinary examples of a variety of encounters This is not to create a false opposition but Serres use of folds is of a different order to Deleuze and Leibnizs Posthuman Ethics facing its lover as a ghost The skeleton is a

shows volume our eyes within and without and the eyes which seek the relation can see a liquid shifting ephemeral immensity the image of whose surface are qualities of thickness and transparency roughness and smoothness hardness and softness All real bodies shimmer like watered silk They are hazy surfaces the love of the composite and the many hued are consummated wordlessly 2008 25 How does this marvelous sounding soul resonate with art encounters Serres explains the soul is knotted like the world and like the world it is unstable  2000 120 He explores the burden of being a subject or subject to a burden Using a very real and very ordinary example Serres explains If you ever have to carry someone on your shoulders from the top of a mountain down to the YaOOe ou wiOO think at first

literature cinema dreams and other forms of art all of course liberated from their genre are examples through which we can explore the outside element because they are at once unresponsive and affective without intent Where Kristeva states The act of questioning is present in artistic experience in rejection and renewal of old codes of representation staged in painting music or poetry 2002 121 we acknowledge that as unresponsive questions do not cannot demand answers However against privileging new codes of representation new codes of apprehension formulate an ahuman ethics of experiencing art The material external nature of art can be encountered willfully while the molecular and despotic elements of art resonate with the turbulent vibrating of the desire potentialized

from the order of love the ecstasy of existence is a summation made possible by the contingency of the other  in fact it is an art of love 2000 29 Can we conceive love of art as an art of love I describe the relation of perceiver and art to one which elicits ecstasy I do so for two reasons 7he first reason is as unresSonsiYe art is not FonFeiYabOe as oppositionally related human but it is not without life per se and so the art encounter is essentially a solitary event or at least what Bataille calls an inner event When knowledge is diminished lived experience begins and the possible emerges the possible in a realm which appeared foreign to intelligence that of inner experience  1988 8 In inner experience when the self attains in the end the fusion of object and subject being as subject nonknowledge as object the unknown Bataille 1988 9 which no longer recognizes differences between the intellectual aesthetic and moral the inner of the self belongs also to outside Being inner within outside fuses not only subject and object but time and space deliverance toward ecstasy The second reason is ecstasy does not privilege any particular kind of affect It is not pleasurable aesthetic as evaluation of worth We thus come back to a conclusion to which art led us The struggle with chaos is only the instrument of a more profound struggle against opinion for the misfortune of people comes from opinion Deleuze and Guattari 1994 206 Nor is it the aesthetic of violence which theory has sought in art both in representation and perception in order to Posthuman Ethics constitute revolutionary art3 Ecstasy has no describable quality just as we cannot desFribe the finite Fontent of art Fstas found in eSerienFinJ art is a FoPPon documented symptom of the pleasurable pain encountered with works that take us outside seen in the Stendhal Syndrome4 for example In ecstatic art encounters the work is available incidentally accidentally volitionally for all selves as offerinJ affeFtiYe SotentiaOiation to aOO subMeFts  there are no OiPits or sSeFifiF requirements for subjects to open as each opens uniquely as a singularity based on the sSeFifiFit of their TuaOities and FaSaFities or the eFstatiF eSerienFe is outside of tiPe  arriYaO and eSurJated satisfaFtion t does not end in saFrifiFe or exhausted death including la petite mort Bataille claims darkness is not absence of light or of sound but absorption into the outside 1988 17 For Bataille ecstasy is found in the leaving behind of objects the lament which is lost when the subject and object are simultaneously dissolved and the self is alienated from self This comes through a giving away of knowledge as anchoring the dialectic of self and nonself presence and revelation so that the others shifts from an other to the outside itseOf µ Fan SroYide it with neither a MustifiFation nor an end I remain in intolerable nonknowledge which has no other way out than ecstasy itself 1988 12 Bataille seems adamant ecstasy comes as agony mourning and painful failure of self It comes as slip seeking experience as an event to be souJht and FontePSOated ut in YoOuPinous eFstas reÀeFtion is iPSossibOe This is the Stendhal moment or Augustines lament that late have I loved thee Lord evincing presence independent from time as the now that cannot be accessed even while it is constitutive of the ecstatic self In address to time this could be called atemporality where the resonances of present past and future which while retaining their own qualities can be tactically perceived as simultaneous This also hurts For the art lover want for a future experience or the work already sees the want FoPe froP a sinJuOar eSerienFe that has inÀaPed the SossibiOit of new desire So the desire toward a future relation comes from something already been but that was not expected The self disappears at this point But of course neither the self nor the works cease to be sensed and sensible FstatiF AfÀiFtiRn The other of the art encounter is an intensityplane not a person or a singularly apprehensible piece of art or predesired scripted act of reading listening touching 3 In his interview with Kristeva Rainer Ganahl critiques the emphasis in art as an act of revolt on destruction as death He points out this tactic employs either a literal or metaphoric strategy both of which relocate themselves in established codes of representation even though content disrupts In Kristeva 2002 4 This syndrome the proper name of which is hyperkulturemia comes from 6tendhaOs eSerienFe of faintinJ at the 8fii JaOOer in OorenFe doFuPented in his Naples and Florence A Journey from Milan to Reggio Art Inhuman Ecstasy or seeing It is sudden and too much For each art encounter an event is created that produces a vague choice for the self to open to an indeterminate revolutionary alterity of selfother element whereby art encountering is an opening up to the outside or to nomenclature and dampen down the inherent subversive experience to reform the self much as discursive regulation and institutions including those which prescribe correct and incorrect readings and interpretations reform the selfconstellation into the human Pain is there the pain is the decisive intensity Forsaking humanity hurts because it both slaughters any sense of hermeneutic subjectivity and the rights counting as human affords The more majoritarian one is the more it hurts The ethics of the artencounter shows becoming ahuman is viable and necessary for new ways of thinking alterity in the realities of life for oppressed sub human subjects Clearly this has always been the case for those unable to control patterns of human signifying systems from sexual racial and diffabled others to other forms of life and the ecological interactions which sustain them beyond human manipulation ffaFePent and etenuation take the seOfwork inÀeFtion outside of diaOeFtiFs and discourse The future of the self needs rethinking because the past has been eSerienFed as surSrisinJ 7his inYoOYes an infinite iPaJination and eOuFidates permanent potentiality of the subject And where is the work Sensed before it was recognized lost when it was the work is achingly nonpresent to the self for capture and consumption yet it remains within the self and the self within the work The unique entity created between and as

atroShied reified as eFstatiF or overwhelmed to the point of the breaking of the Body without Organs we may risk if we take our experiment too far and stretch our tensor too tight The ecstatics joy when the state alters its distribution is one that welcomes the new pain In her memoirs perhaps the most famous ecstatic Teresa of Avila tells us when this pain of which I am now speaking begins the Lord seems to transport the soul and throw it into an ecstasy 211 Ecstatic being refuses the folding which Posthuman Ethics constitute subjectivisation Instead it experiences self as wonder inextricable from experience which experiences nothing recognisable or perceptible beyond indescribable state of encounter with the outside The event resonates with our encounter with the event of the

transport of the soul5 which is the state or condition of the being which is Blanchots being without end and being without thought yet it does not mean transportation in space or through time The souls transport is one of various relations with the outside which is always the same relation Just as thought is unthought pain and joy are neither and both The temporalization of pain as experience involves the pain being either on or off waiting for the pain and watching it recede so living in a state of what next or when Where Bataille sees the encounter with non knowledge as death or rather death as the cure for nonknowledge Bataille 1988 111 the ecstatics nonknowledge does not presume that that which will be known or that which is lost as knowable before it arrives  including the selfs

art encounter beyond the evanescent blind silent everything As Marsden points out the fact that the blinding and abasement of self should yield both insight and beatitude is one of the enduring enigmas of mystical experience It is precisely through the abdication of knowledge through the liquidation of its conditions of possibility that divinity is touched Marsden 2002 129 Differentiating ecstasy from a more obvious form of self suffering such as masochism to describe abasement as masochistic emphasizes the value of what is lost Blindness of self through art encounters is not the

1993a 767 While they are a catalyst they are neither extricated nor invasive but irrefutably dissipated within he and the protagonist is dissipated within them The catalyst is the event of encounter  the art event not the witness forming the contractual demand These entities are liberated from this limited option of emergence as dead or alive apart or as coming from within when the protagonist comprehends the option itself demands speech within a frame that gives the dead a before presence and no future hence absented loss of them only for he who sSeaks theP or OanFhot sSeeFh is aOso

Primarily it perhaps perversely gives the others as artworks their own mode of perception where traditional encounters with art denies the art catalyst facilitator all existence beyond a phantasized identity of clear meaning usually via the artist ut the other as unresSonsiYe inorJaniF works SerFeStion is not there to affirP the self so it is not a perceived perception It is imagined as

voluminous familiarcircle And it is ethical because the self that Art Inhuman Ecstasy is lost must trust the other as perceiving in this same aperceptive way I am here but not here because there is no

through surrogates in opposition to Blanchots protagonists encounter The life to come is the life which cannot be unique because it is a repetition of the life gone Temporal extension is inherent but the occupants of each time are the same and demand of their progeny they also be the same Existence is solitary and singular between entities of past and future The protagonists encounter is teeming and allpresent without phantasy or perception Orpheus desires sexual union with the Eurydice he reveals What makes art encounters interesting is that to an extent they premise themselves on solitary experience The reproducer and the act of sexual union need another that is isomorphically made appropriately correspondent to the self Bataille amusingly reminds us however that the solitary little theatre is always in operation like a daydream lived out in intercourse 2001 107 The artist may produce but not progeny reproducing the artist The art witness recognizes nothing in the encounter with and as the everything that art opens being both the opening and the open Unlike the voracious lover who seeks an object upon which to alight the art objects love demands a kind of inattention which

Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition This chapter attempts a project which creates an impasse even though it remains antagonistic to sovereign operations of representation or the very thought of the other It is one which posits a somewhat utopian scheme that may verge in its aspirations on unworkable within the frames of knowledge within which we operate It addresses animals or correctly nonhuman animals which will hitherto be referred to as nonhumans This is why it is a posthuman project Human apprehension and comprehension cannot limit nonhumans within an ethical relation What this chapter seeks is an absolute abolitionist stance on all interaction with  conceptually and actually  any nonhuman Radical animal rights is increasingly becoming fed up with thinking the animal even through antispeciesist philosophy as it elucidates the luxuriant arguments in which humans indulge in the name of the rights of them and us based on qualities of each or critiquing the qualities ascribed to each yet remaining within a realm that speaks of thus speaks for and ultimately speaks with human language Maintaining speech within the limits human language compels is the crux of all argument It implies a shared language Further from the repudiation of animal rights based on equivalence which antispeciesism has foregrounded in order to create an ethics of the inevitable shared living with nonhumans only the human can and needs to be deconstructed and the humans trajectories toward posthumanism have nothing to do with other life If this were the technique of posthumanism it would simply constitute a reverse of dragging nonhumans up to human level to be viable Any thinking of nonhuman entities in posthuman theory a clear trend in current posthuman publications fails the very premise of its ambition no matter how amorphous or experimental Thinking the nonhuman in posthuman ethics should indeed can only concern itself with the human and its decentred and delimited futures in order to create hope in reference to inevitable perhaps unfortunate not for humans often for nonhumans encounters with nonhumans This may sound nihilistic and certain responses are presumed  of course animals enjoy interactions with humans or we can help as much as hurt animal systems can teach us how to be posthuman or the most basic question we need to think differently about animals No we need to think about the undoing of us whatever that means From the irrefutably important work done by animal rights philosophers and activists unfortunate in its necessity seeking equality thinking needs to go further enough to accept thought itself as inherently unethical in reference to the nonhuman The simplest Posthuman Ethics premise of my perhaps contentious argument on the humans posthuman future visàvis the nonhuman comes from Serres devastatingly hopeful and demanding concept of grace whoever is nothing whoever has nothing passes and steps aside From a bit of force from any force from anything from any decision from any determination  Grace is nothing it is nothing but stepping aside Not to touch the ground with ones force not to leave any trace of ones weight to leave no mark to leave nothing to yield to step aside  to dance is only to make room to think is only to step aside and make room give up ones place 1995 47 Serres discussing dance as philosophy and philosophy as a dance elaborates that dance negotiates nakedness the unwritten tablet the absent man We can then speak of philosophys liberation from situatedness no matter how multiple or mobile to dance where seeking nothingness is antithetical to nihilistic nothingness rather a means by which we can become capable of anything and that very capacity results in the freedom of real responsibility far from the freedom to do what we can as dominant humans to allow the nonhuman to be Language is a power shared dissymmetrically with more or less weight between humans There is no shared language between humans and nonhumans Any sympathetic argument about what interactions we may have or share with nonhumans is always limited by our thinking the encounter even via abstracted language thoughts from outside which delimit language Many sympathetic to the wonder of encounters with nonhumans elevate these encounters to some kind of mystical experience because they demand another kind of thinking of the encounter itself But still the experience is human Claiming nonhuman encounters emphasize the animality of the human or the enchantments of incommensurable nonetheless available in relation with something that allows us to access the elements of us that escape the human which society culture language thought deny us are all human claims There is no deliverance from the human found in the nonhuman The division must remain for the very premise to be valid We are in a seeming impossible bind In Death of the Animal Paola Cavalieri incepts the basic premise of posthuman antispeciesism The notion of animality seems to have been created just to serve the metaphysics of the primacy of human beings Cavalieri 3 What Peter Singer calls second wave animal rights continues the same questions which place onus on nonhumans  do they thinksufferhave intelligence and therefore should we test an insipid prettied vernacular for torture eat essentially exocannibalism slaughter correctly murder and use for products such as milk and eggs enslave In Defense of Animals The Second Wave includes chapters on vivisection and speciesism in the laboratory farming reform the science of suffering criticism of zoos and advice for effective activism Noble and necessary though these arguments are they never rise from discursive games between humans about animals Abolitionist Gary Francoine points out Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition the smarts game is one that nonhuman animals can never win  The smarts game is just that  a game It is yet another reason not to accord animals moral siJnifiFanFe toda in faYor of Pore siOO and harPfuO researFh to deterPine whether animals can solve human math puzzles and perform other tasks that have no moral relevance We already know everything we need to know to come to the conclusion that we cannot justify eating wearing or using animals  that like us animals are sentient They are subjectively aware They have interests in not suffering and continuing to live Nothing more is needed 2011 Lyotard states It is in the nature of a victim not to be able to prove one has done a wrong A plaintiff is someone who has incurred damages and who disposes of the means to prove it One becomes a victim if one loses these means One loses them for example if the author of the damages turns out directly or indirectly to be ones judge  the perfect crime does not consist in killing the victim or the witnesses  but rather in obtaining the silences of the witnesses 1988 8 Both the welfarist and the persecutor are judge Nonhumans are not simply siOenFed but in the Post refined of unethiFaO situations inFaSabOe of anthinJ but silence when it is only the action of the human that should be silencedceased Various misguided liberation and welfarist movements perpetuate decreasing animal suffering Very few welfarist arguments see abolition as a clear direct and most enigmatically obvious simple resolution Questions which are persistent from both pro and anti animal rights include of what are they capable what do we owe to them Rather what happens when we ask of what are we capable or what is possible in the absolute cessation of interaction with animals at a conceptual as actual level The issue of rights is a human intervention The issue of moral obligation of should is a human folly Any ascription of any quality to any nonhuman is a human compulsion toward vindication or liberation The animal remains the point of exchange the site of contestation but always the There is nothing to think of the animal Thus Derrida states It would therefore be a reinscribing this difference between reaction ascribed by Lacan to the human and response ascribed to the animal and hence this historicity of ethical juridical or political responsibility within another thinking of life of the living within a different relation of the living to their selfness to their autos to their own autokinesis and reactional automaticity to death to techniques or to the machine Derrida 2003 129 2f his readinJ of errida oOfe states µburied under the definite artiFOe here µthe aniPaO is aOO the heteroJeneit that Pakes the

observe differences within species  or within small groups of one kind of species  or even within one example of a species These are still nomenclature of life In a seeming paradox a certain kind of recycling of the word animal may simply refer to each every this one incarnation of life Unethical Equivalence Much has been written on the rights of nondominant others and their equivalencies While clearly antagonistic to my criticism of any equivalencies much of Posthuman Ethics deals with the inhuman other that is the other who is biologically but not culturally or socially viable as a certain kind of human As Adams points out the current ontological condition of animals has less to do with their being than with our consciousness 194 The animal conception of women racial others the diffabled the generally maligned interrogates the heart of the power of language in constituting the broad species of non countingashumans In what could be seen as a brave claim Derrida to an extent Lyotard and Nobel Prize Laureates Isaac Bashevis Singer and JM Coetzee see the operation of factory farming testing and other uses of animals as equivalent to the operations of Auschwitz a comparison which is beautifully and painfully explored in Charles Pattersons Eternal Treblinka Marjorie Spiegels The Dreaded Comparison Human and Animal Slavery has a similar historical project Where current traditional ideology often posits the humannonhuman animal as the great divide intrahuman divides from the very beginnings of philosophy have seen minoritarians as organisms related more intimately with animals than dominant humans The continuation of the suggestion that what we used to do to huPans was unthinkabO horrifiF and thus Fan be PaSSed on our current treatment of nonhumans is a seductive form of rhetorical pathos It is certainly needed in its capacity for diminishing the effect of the perpetuation of torture and murder fetishization and forced assimilation But this does not eradiFate the issue n faFt in refininJ the SroMeFt of aniPaO Oiberation throuJh humananimal connections it may even exacerbate speciesism Certain species seem more clearly appropriate in their

when the ruPSs OeJs and thiJhs of FhiFkens are reÀeFted in the ruPSs and thighs of woman what happens to other animals Does the great ape project Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition verify the value of the human because of closely shared DNA Will we understand that the Oedipalization of the pet is not a better way of treating animals It is certainly consumption of a different kind but discourse continues to envelop and slaughter all animals in unique subtle and devastating ways Flawed or human arguments which seek to liberate animals are irrefutably necessary in the incremental saving of life from the oppressions of the human and these arguments all in their own way seek to cease certain human behaviours albeit pleading via human logic The persistence of the human turn will never attain a philosophy of grace nor will any philosophy of the nonhuman Where one stream of theory has sought to create historical rather than contemporary equivalencies to elucidate the extremity of the current treatment of nonhumans others think that by using animality we can be liberated toward posthuman becomings Animals like women cannot become majoritarian Adams association of animal rights with womens rights is persuasive in pointing out what both want is freedom not to but from and not from situations or acts of cruelty or oppression or death but from majoritarian or any attendant regime of general equivalence between systems of value  necessarily accompanied b an utterO hoSeOess fetishiation of Srofit1 Guattari 1996a 122 The rights of an aniPaO to be free froP torture and beinJ eaten reÀeFt the riJhts of woPen to be free from sexual assault Both emerge through a discourse which places the onus upon them as differend to prove they are not meant for food or sex Importantly for threshold and hybrid becomings while many advocates and rights philosophers address issues directly related to their own identity animal rights activists inherently speak as the irreducibly other because the other cannot speak the language which destroys it This is increasingly evident in recent US legal arguments which repudiate the rights of animals evaluated simply on the extent of their experiencing cruelty as wrong when it is for fun rather than cause to elevating animals to the status of entities with rights Property law and death as either one of autonomy or domination the question of whose property would give animals that very whoness that they are denied  who ness without equivalency based on similarity However the US supreme courts problem is that animals do not have standing to seek redress or assistance SlocumSchaffer 78 SlocumSchaffer points out that in various US legal cases violation of the rights of genetically engineered animals was ruled violation of patent that the refusal of students to dissect was acceptable based on the rights of students not animals The laws problem with animals is not that they may own their bodies but that they cannot recognize rules the very human paradigms which allow them to exist and which make them inferior as they apparently cannot make their own rules Serres states taxonomies to emphasize his point that the rational man and the foolish man differ in their affections and their affects but both strive to persevere in existing according to these affections and affects From this standpoint their only difference is one of power 1988b 102 Posthuman Ethics The declaration of the rights of man had the merit of saying every man and the weakness of thinking only men or men alone  objects

other is a seductive stepping stone not to how we should perceive nonhumans differently nor why maligned humans should be treated better than animals but explicitly why human discourse itself creates perpetuates and irretrievably binds the possibility of thinking ethically in reference to all which fall outside the human ideal The problem is not that aniPaOs suffer Oike us or eYen that the suffer for Srofit where SeoSOe dont care Unethical treatment of animals and women and unsympathetically Deleuze and Guattaris becoming animal terms and the posthuman fashion for demarcating fallacious patterns between technologies and insect and other nonhuman mapping theories involve legal contracts for which the other party has no agency or is acknowledged for its independent alterity really contracts between majoritarians for the use value of the object Animals are in the way or used for the way Joy Dunayer emphasizes human chauvinism is one type of speciesism 4 This is mirrored by Braidottis 2006 1059 however her claim that animal rights activism shifts the moral and legal balance in favour of animals 107 creates an unnecessary bifurcation Lyotard 1988 28 points out that such arguments involve placing the defender before the victim because the shift is created by someone the defender The animal cannot bear witness according to Lyotard and for this reason the animal is particularly in need as they neither create nor affect the paradigm directly Lyotard criticizes the belief in a universe prior to phrases but animals are prior to phrases and yet we implement them and only allow the possibility of their being or nonbeing as the speciesist would claim in this discursive world Thus the animal it could be argued is not one in a series of valued victims but its oppressed beingness makes its rights equivalent to other victimized beingnesses for no other reason than it is regardless of what it is Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition Whose Companionship Sympathetic explorations of animality coming from poststructural and posthuman theory seek to evocatively offer alternate potentializations of sense and perception based on fiJurations of the aOtered territories of ForSoreaO eSerienFe whiFh beOonJ to other species The most persistent question which prevails in much academic animal rights writing is perhaps ironically the same question that has allowed the oppression and slaughter of nonhuman bodies the question of who The tradition of observing the animal and denying it any rights because it is seen as a machine or a brute or an idea over which God gives the human dominion asks the same question but the response which vindicates speciesism is usually who it is not Utilitarianism comparative questions of personhood based on suffering and sense of a nonhumans own awareness of its existence and issues of welfare laid the groud for animal rights and from these posthuman trajectories have emerged Theorists who focus on the humananimal collapse and the question of Identity as a human investment when considering the liberation of the troubling concept nonconcept of animals such as Haraway Wolfe and Derrida to lesser or greater degrees ask the question in order to show three particular tendencies not simply in the humans formulation of relations between humannonhuman entities but the humans very capacity to ask itself the qualities which allow the question to emerge the paradigms which close off other questions and ultimately who has the riJht to sSeak where the wiOO be heard 7he first is the Tuestion of who whiFh

deeply troubling predispositions My and dog are both antagonistic to a posthuman ethics of nonhumanity Her dog is by being her dog the Oedipal dog In spite of her second question which is how is becoming with a practice of becoming worldly 2007 3 Haraway has missed the territory which diverges human Oedipal families to which the dog belongs from the abstract animal machines of becomings There is a becoming animal which is not content to proceed by resemblance and for which resemblance on the contrary would represent an obstacle or stoppage  an irresistible deterritorializations that forestalls attempts at professional Posthuman Ethics conjugal or Oedipal reterritorializations Are there Oedipal animals with which one can play Oedipus play family my little dog Deleuze and Guattari

ordinary and the profound absence of curiosity about and respect for and with actual animals 2007 27 Haraway performs a particular antagonistic and not entirely attentive reading of Deleuze and Guattari in two ways one of which is a reading I also contend The misreading Haraway and I would share is that for which Deleuze and Guattari have been critiqued by feminists such as Braidotti Irigaray Jardine and Massumi in reference to becoming woman Deleuze and Guattari use the minoritarian in order to facilitate a somewhat fetishistic adventure in what they are not insinuating cooption

participation of dog and human FonYenientO OookinJ for sPSathetiF reFonfiJurations of doPestiFation and that she calls the use of laboratory animals and animals murdered for food domestication is offensive while companionship is how she elegantly ablates the fact of dogs being enslaved through domestication No matter how deculturalized she sees the human companion while seeing the relation as natural it will always seem right Deleuze and Guattari show a belief in unnatural participations being here and now the notright as in not logical or based on commensurability within taxonomies that is all around us and that by seeing the unnatural as the only ethical direction shows both our responsibility and urgency in refusing the politics of comfort and resolution of humannonhuman relations which can be seen to be no better than the division of humannonhuman through disgust and subjugation Inevitably however Haraways main misreading comes from the fault of Deleuze and Guattaris concept of woman and animal in that they are not talking about women or animals They are talking about the abstract fabulations which deliver Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition siJnifiFation itseOf

those animal lives for which we are still responsible through depriving pets of their independence from humans over millennia of domestic enslavement Posthuman Ethics seemingly compulsory whether

collides with logocentrism Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition possible based on how to observe and classify5 Dialectic observation is part of the collapsed structure of metaphysics and humanism in philosophy science and the consideration of life The observer is perhaps the inobservable He must at least be last on the chain of observables If he is supplanted he becomes observed Thus he is in a position of a parasite Not only because he takes the observation that he doesnt return but also because he plays the last position Serres 2007 237 No matter how hard Derrida admonishes that observation by his cat makes him naked coupled with his criticism of Levinas by pointing out that in Levinasian ethics there is to my knowledge no attention ever given to the animal gaze 2008 107 the gaze is a human conceit and affording the animal a gaze continues to hold equality albeit sensitive to alterity as the mark of ethical attention toward animals Putting the human second to last is an

SaradiJPs of SerFeStion  not within species but within each animal life  and that this can never be subsumed or incorporated into any mode of thought the human can formulate even if the human seeks to open the world to animal liberty By giving the animal the gaze the human takes the position he doesnt return by returning it to a human conceit Many of the arguments made for animal rights are constituted by the complexity of a species social group or with the feelings and responses a species shows when engaged with human interactions The deduction tells the human we should not treat an animal cruelly because they6 can feel we should not denigrate their complexity because they show a diversity of behaviours within their soFiaO struFture Jain we find ourseOYes within sstePs of

human terrain posthumanism challenges 2009 13 6 I use the awkward and not entirely grammatically correct third person plural here This is not to homogenize animals as collectives but to avoid imposing human gender dimorphism on other life forms Posthuman Ethics states two points which resonate here In speaking of the Holocaust Lyotard states The plaintiffs conclusion should have been that since the only witnesses are the victims and since there are no victims but dead ones no place can be identified as a Jas FhaPber 1988   7he aSSOiFation of otards differend to the murdered animal is clear but the animal as differend is also the dead victim in that the living animal is dead to the capacity to negotiate its existence using the appropriate kind of phrase not to bear witness to its suffering but to bear witness to its ability to describe suffering within human paradigms Because this is impossible these descriptions come from human interpreters yet the inevitable problem of all animal speech being speaking for and speaking about animals emphasizes that all speech is human and all phrases are between humans The animal does not exist except as a human communication The animal does not exist as an animal or a life While we are human there are no animals only human ideas of animality The media wonders at and lauds the signing ape the speaking parrot the obedient dog who understands These individual animals speak human They are seen as clever and worthy because of their uncanny capacity to be human The protected species which dazzles through its aesthetic beauty  the big cat for example  speaks to our aesthetic language and must be saved But it is a species constituted by numbers not this cat or one cat but how many cats are left and how can more people see more cats for our pleasure One cow cannot speak human nor in its plentiful occurrences can it appeal with its scarcity Welfarists speak for the cow but someone somehow asks why the cow but rarely this or one cow or no use of species deserves its life The question should be not why we should question the treatment of certain animals homogenized as species and expect a reply nor why any animal should want to reply even though we think it would be in that animals best interest but what gives us the audacity to ask a nonhuman life any question The animal cannot be thought Therefore ethically the animal should not be thought If animal life and human life could be superimposed perfectly then neither man nor animal  and perhaps not even the divine  would any longer be thinkable Agamben 21 Agamben is critical of this turn seeing it as increasingly dehumanizing for human subjects Agamben however sees thought as necessary for human rights In the context of this chapter human thought more correctly operational tactical knowledge is the impasse that precludes any capacity for nonspeciesist ethiFs nowOedJe itseOf  defined as a FonsteOOation of noPenFOature totaOiinJ machine isomorphic dominance the repetitive and reifying patterns which continue the human logos  is what props discourse and discourse allows for thought Thought in a posthuman sense is thought from outside thinking

we are to encounter the nonhuman without being parasites the grace which can only come from leaving alone Traditional arguments would see more and more detail about the wonders of the animal as the most logical directive toward liberation Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition Posthuman ethics of grace requires nothing more than leaving all animals alone in interacting with them in thinking them in involving them at all with a human world Our becomingsinhuman do not devolve us toward more interaction with the natural world humanism and metaphysics cleave from us It delivers us from the inevitable destruction we wreak on that world The more we think that world the further it is irretrievably part of it Animals do not offer posthuman deliverance neither does rethinking the animal deliver nonhuman life As Serres says grace is a stepping aside and when the posthuman steps aside from discourse it steps aside from other life The logic of rights is a contract between species which was a result of humans acknowledging the damage we do No animals were involved in this contract just as no animals were involved in the contracts which tortured and murdered them The social contract was thereby completed but closed upon itself leaving the world on the sidelines an enormous collection of things reduced to passive objects to be appropriated Serres 2002 36 Rights are human laws Animal rights are human laws concerning contracts of liberty without the oppressed or liberated Immediate activism based on these rights is needed and do lead to certain individual lives being better But any intervention from human discourse will never break this perpetual contract against nature Animals do not need us except as a direct result of what we have done to them through domestication or destruction of habitat We use them the parasitic relation is never reciprocal we are never host Our discourse and communication about animals is a result of the ways we have exploited and ab used them parasite off them needed them and wanted them Arguments that aniPaOs need us are Àawed in their Fonstitution throuJh huPan FonFeSts 7he are often pragmatically and rightly based on the need for care borne of reliance on what our enslavement has made them depend Long term through preventing reproduction animals with close human dependent interaction this will be less relevant The natural contract outside of the capacity for human thought is the contract we make without knowing the tenets of the agreement because we do not know how to know them The contract is one of leaving alone and will as I will contentiously argue in the Epilogue ultimately demand of us the question of whether the only valid extinction is that of the human Abolitionists seek to abolish human intervention so abolish humans This makes the abolitionist approach to antispeciesism ethically posthuman Serres states War is characterized not by the brute explosion of violence but by its organization and its legal status  violence plus some contract  we must make a new pact a new preliminary agreement with the objective enemy of the human world the world as such  we must envisage along the other diagonal a new pact to sign with the world the natural contract 2002 1315 Posthuman Ethics To see the natural world the extrahuman world which we colonize with human siJnifiFation and oFFuS with deYastatinJ effeFts as antaJonistiF to the huPan world performs a beautiful dance just as Serres sees the philosophy of grace a dance Posthumanism directs a challenge to tenets of deconstructive elements of poststructuralism the zenith of which is Derridas maxim There is nothing outside the text As either the reading from the translation which suggests there is nothing outside of discourse or the French reading of textuality as a series of eternaO eOOiSses sOidinJ siJnifiers siJnifiers in debt to differenFe this Shrase has come to stand as both the cause and fate of human access or prevention of that

prelinguistic mark and what elsewhere in Kristeva for example is known as the semiotic or Guattari the asemiotic Whatever vocabulary we use to attempt to encounter this experience we are struck with the realization there is no vocabulary for it Very simply if there is nothing outside the text is taken as an attentive description of human experience then a posthuman philosophy attests to the world being everything When nothing is overcome everything arrives as part of posthuman experience a connective traversive ecosophical ethics Nonhumans are both posthuman as extradiscursive but they are also part of their own textual worlds to which we are irreducibly alienated Tempting though it may be to from a welfarist and ethological desire explore map or only acknowledge social communicative methods in other species or relinquishing species in individual lives who experience think express and are affected we can never ask because we can never know Thinking we can whether to empathize or denigrate is a humanist metaphysical ambition This terminal etriFation between indiYiduaO OiYinJ entities both reÀeFts the PuOtiSOe subMeFt in its teeming internal schizoaffects intrahuman relations insofar as two human lives are always in an impasse within communication and constitutes a relation that is ethically connective because it requires creativity and grace Gracious communications are natural contracts and binding ties which Serres describes as that liasing element between two entities that can stretch taut and atrophy or become loose and supple The elements themselves are created by the cord much as Spinozan ethics sees the expressive and affective appetite and will of the organism as constituted through its capacity to express and be affected that is through its relation with another element The bond between two elements is the natural contract It only becomes law when it is overstretched or is used to yoke dyssymetrically Law marks limits The bond makes it possible to feel these borders but only when it beFoPes taut straiJht that is when it beFoPes Oaw 3rior to that it defines a space plane or volume free and unbound Or a zone of nonlaw within law Thus the

becomings elucidating the detrimental effects of human discourse and thus the urgent need to forsake it and the powers which it affords It is perhaps the why that catalyses posthumanism without FonFretiinJ JeneaOoJ or oriJin that SrediFts future or finitude oth the nonhuman animal and the posthuman through the ethical bond become nothing but nothings of different orders The nonhuman animal is nothing as it is unthinkable and nothing because it should be avoided in order to prevent human intervention in nonhuman worlds even if they overlap It is however everything and suffiFient to itseOf and Pust be treated thus 7he SosthuPan is nothinJ as it is also unthinkable but involves thinking multiply and otherwise Against all claims we need to rethink animals the only gracious ethics of nonhuman relation is to absolutely cease all thought which includes animals The teaching corps like the dancing corps and the thinking subject is forever evoking forever invoking calling another focus than itself So naked so blank so empty so absent that it brings forth a presence Serres 1995 45 Where Levinas claims we need an Other not necessarily perceived but encountered toward which we turn in order to form an ethical relation using Serres I argue that leaving the other alone is ethical invocation responsibility for our actions not their lives or existences Posthuman Ethics and calling forth independent of result perceived emergent entity The thinking posthuman subject perceiving without knowledge thinking without perceiving brings forth the other as its own coming Serres grace as stepping aside allows without Fondition SrediFtion or affirPation 7he ePerJent other owes nothinJ to the posthuman The posthuman is created when the focus is away from the human and away from the nonhuman animal it discusses to vindicate its unethical use and abuse of each nonhuman animal entity 7 Activist Absence We do not owe an obligation to those lives we have enslaved awaiting their natural extinguishment We do not need to bear witness for them as differends who can no longer bear witness to their own tragedy We can and must bear witness to what we have done and attempt to make lives of enslaved nonhumans as without intervention as possible In reference to so called domesticated animals this may involve intervention but not mastery intervention as passive nonhumans allowing the enslaved nonhuman to be without conditions of their being This will be an ethics based entirely on singular interactions and without prescription or species conditioned strategy The obligation perversely is one without care to another but bearing witness to the ravages of what we have done In order to bear witness the onO iPaJe we see is the other without reSresentation or obMeFtifiFation so bearing witness to our refused traversal resists indulging in some mirror of selves plagued with accountability that through expiation can resolve us back to our huPanit and the faOOaFious Srefi of µhuPane ones 7he oSen of the huPan animal fails in the animal insofar as the animal is not open to I resist Agamben and Heideggers argument here as it maintains the humanist conceit that the nonhuman

remembering the welfarist argument is only relevant in an unethical nonposthuman world Examples would be the need to look after enslaved animals who have become dependent on humans To this I would agree but add all these lives should be prevented from reproducing and continuing the enslaved dependence A more radical criticism and one about which I am still uncertain is that if a truly ethical posthuman cared for the abolition of animal suffering then predators would be neutered fed on synthetic food which would stop all unnatural animal death and further as much animal iOOness wouOd be treated as was SossibOe 7his wouOd Pean huPan interYention not for benefit of humans but nonhuman life Cessation of predation may mean exhaustion of food resources for nonpredators This could lead to the suggestion that the only way to prevent all suffering of nonhuman life would be to prevent any further reproduction of any life I am not yet convinced this is a nonviable idea The human element of this suggestion will be explored in the Epilogue Animalities Ethics and Absolute Abolition has a nonhuman conceit much in the same way as atheism claims there is no god while needing to engage the concept of god to give this claim veracity Agamben and Heidegger utilize this denial of the animals openness which I neither deny or affirP but FonfirP as beOonJinJ onO and whoOO to the huPan in order to Yerif the residual nonhuman in the human but on its own terms as beingness of a uniquely human kind that grapples with the human being that opens in order to perceive apprehend and qualify Agamben quotes Jakob von Uexkull claiming the animal has no object 2004 39 This is due to the object and object relations belonging only to the human Just as nothing is outside discourse evokes everything so falling away from being open immerses us in the everything While man always has the world before him  always only stands facing opposite  and never enters the pure space of the outside  the animal instead moves into the open in a nowhere without the no  Agamben 2004 57 Obligation the bestowing of rights welfarism and sympathy are according to an abolitionism view the civilized versions of totemism fetishism and metaphor They retain the object and to what and how the human will be open They retain the address The radical inversion of abolition is that the address will always be detrimental because humanism cannot address without the object to which it feels obliged but which in actuality it makes oblige themselves to the human Thinking the animal thinks the object and opens to the object in the turn that constitutes the human Veganism can be used here as an example Veganism is frequently constituted in three ways8  as denial or avoidance of certain foods as giving up of these foods and as exemplifying life without these foods primarily through life without intervention into animal life The third is the most gracious way Denying and avoiding foods retains openness to them as foods Giving them up reorients a focus on a somewhat Sious subMeFtiYit 9eJanisP as eYinFed b we who OiYe without whiOe defininJ without as no possibility of inclusion so the with does not insinuate their could be a with and the out is not a departure or prevented intervening shows the very basic bare reality of humans not needing and never having need for the products of slavery torture and murder This phrasing is used with the focus away from the potentially more emotive and humanist description of acts of violence and toward the not We do not Not the welfarist rights or moral philosophers we should not although that is the case except the we are those who decided what should and should not be We do not need to address encounter or maintain the parasitic relation with the nonhuman Any and all studies claiming what humans need are human studies and are belied by the simple reality of living vegan life Similarly if the example of vivisection is used the lives now living have lived hitherto until now Anything to FoPe Pa etend the FoPSuOsiYe infinit Shantasies of huPan Oife but beond the arguments for this form of science being either repugnantly capitalist for

or sFientifiFaOO sSeFious to the detriPent of the human organism we are in a position to step aside and leave be Veganism here is only one example and as it also belongs to the human taxonomy of subjects it is used tactically as a contemporary example of grace as the stepping aside The relationship between the vegan and the animal is ended From the practical to the paradigmatic veganism can be changed to thought itself as the unthought encounter with the outside ithin infinite reOations and thinkinJs of their own whiFh are absolutely inaccessible to human apprehension the nonhuman animal belongs to the outside they cannot enter into human discourse and discourses of nonhumans are inaccessible to humans Our entrance with within and as the outside creates an inÀeFtion a new

derealized What we are and have is already phenomenally too much as I will discuss in chapters 7 and 8 but from an abolitionist gracious paradigm the posthuman refuses parasitic needs Gracious posthuman attestation to the nonhuman animal delivers the animal and the human from law to freedom Law as prescriptive according to Lyotards reading of Kant deduces its conclusion Incrementally

This ensures obligation remains with the I You is diminished as a comprehensible addressee to a life with will and appetite unknown but to which we are obliged without demanding obligation or reciprocity The entity harbouring this spontaneous causality which is neither principle nor demand cannot be the addressee The latter receives the announcement of spontaneity in the form of quoting Kant dependence constraint or coercion The addressee is not the one who is able to The addressor is the one who is able to who is the power Lyotard 1988 121 If the addressor makes ability a compulsory

Lyotard 1988 121 Our obligation to leave the nonhuman life alone from an activism perspective still obliges us to turn toward the other human to make demands not of you ought but you are able to because speciesist humans think they are either unable to live without animal slavery torture and murder which is fallacious or in the overwhelming face of animal abuse in all facets of human life they think they are unable to do anything because they really seek to tell the other human you ought to Command and response evince a lack of freedom of will of appetite But the submission most humans give to the you ought to shows that ability takes efforts of corporeality and imagination while succumbing to command fosters the luxuries of apathy many of which masquerade as a demand of the I for the right to abuse The right to dominance claimed by humans is the individuals exploitation of the perception of the you ought to as being you must but is actually you are able to but choose not to The dominating structures of capital which perpetuate torture slavery and 11 The effects of raising animals on world poverty and the environment are devastating however privileging world hunger and green issues over animal life is speciesist and somewhat politically fashionable Nonetheless issues such as natural environment damage causing suffering to life are crucial to attending to the effects

Teras Teratology has referred to the study of monsters and monstrosity in all epistemic incarnations though most often in medicine Two inclinations resonate with two effects encountered in relations with monsters Irrefutable and irresistible wonder and terror have led in the life sciences to a compulsion to cure or redeem through making sacred or sympathy The effect monstrosity has upon the

icon of what is normal and thus the monster as what is not human For this reason the monster has an ideal and intimate relationship with the concept of the posthuman Posthuman teratology interrogates

patterns of nonspecular expressivity such as behavioural or communicative diversions from what is Posthuman Ethics considered within the spectrum of unremarkable behaviour Each mode has its own unique

of monsters that becoming monster is fraught with the threat of being named monster by someone else in the wrong terms as the wrong kind of monster within the wrong discursive episteme But what becoming monster does successfully achieve is the emphatic refusal of categories and boundaries that have been set up for monsters semimonsters and the rare normal subject Braidotti emphasizes We need to learn to think of the anomalous the monstrously different not as a sign of pejoration but as the unfolding of virtual possibilities that point to positive alternatives for us all  1  7he YirtuaO

Monsters challenge all of these categories by being both resistant to and ambiguous within them Whatever the joys of love for and as monster the risks are great both towards our expectations of what posthuman teratology will mean in a real socioactivist context and also the risks we take by appropriating a concept that is dangerously linked with degrading and powerembedded practices Monsters in themselves are created through a bordering and create bordering encounters Within monstrous identity therefore there is already morethanone and relating with the monster mirrors this multiplicity within the singular There is no evidence of discrete identity not even bad identity Resonating with the turn to animality in posthuman theory the monster is a hybrid of animal and human But another way to utilize animality in posthuman teratology without assimilation or fetishization comes from fabulations of impossible combinations created not throuJh sutured forPs but interPinJOinJ intensities or eaPSOe in fiFtion Pth and SoSuOar FuOture we find the werewoOf and the YaPSire erewoOYes are Sart human part wolf without being examples of either They operate with the word werewolf because there

where the only demarcation of objects comes through proximity and vibration or turbulence Why in this argument I maintain the monster as monstrous object is twofold First the monster is frequently

OikeO the Ponster as reFeiYer Pore OikeO to reFeiYe in 6erres warninJ wa  beaten struck and so forth The ethical turn of the perceiving other will be a part of this sensation of diminishing affect

Post likely to form new unthought of relations which encounter the monster as molecular synthesis rather than obstructive traumatic collision Love for Monsters onstituted b the order of siJnifiFation the subMeFt in SroiPit with the Ponster cannot sense because sense is blocked by knowledge just as harmony is destroyed by collision Errors are of sensation as perception so an object cannot be an erroneous subject the monster not an erroneous human Monstrosity is experienced as a viscous seduction of perturbation We can only name monstrosity under these conditions as mucosal inextricable

OoYe in seeking sensation and grace in forsaking the human inclination to exert and maintain power through taxonomical ordering At this stage of thinking monstrosity comes a perplexing question What in this new desire does it mean to be a monster The troubling but somewhat necessary persistence of syntaxes of we and they have become confounded We speak of those who name while speaking of those who are named I have deliberately used this oscillating and sometimes frustrating pronoun use for two reasons 7he first aFknowOedJes µwe as in aOO subMeFts are FoPSOiFit in naming and exerting power through practices of knowledge This is most evident in historical genealogies of monstrosity taxonomy and teratology But it continues in any space where extrication from another is activated for purposes of preserving dominance or simply demarcation The second conversely welcomes and addresses the monstrosity that all subjects contain and the risks certain subjects take through political activities which enhance monstrosity through occupying spaces and performing actions that resist disrupt and make the concept of the normal transparent We are all monsters and all not monsters depending on our relation with signifying systems Power is its own act of desire Imagination through encounters with alterity that catalyse loss of self is a form of desire that is like the spectacle or encounter with the monster itself both frightening and FoPSeOOinJ seduFtiYe and danJerous 7hus Ponstrosit in its finaO definition as the siPSOe turbuOenFe that FoOOides or harPonies with the Àuidit of our own seOYes is nothing more than a wondrousness possible in all things which requires not the monster as entity but monstrous encounter The monster in this destructure is independent of all objects as it is a state of relation It is the in between the threshold and we are left with our selves as constituted as part of and through this The Wonder of Teras relation Without a relation of

entirely ahuman inhuman posthuman becomings When the human becomingimperceptible politic dissipates the human into collective molecular assemblages with environment and cosmos when I becomes we is it

disidentiﬁcation with this icon prompts me to take other directions towards the investigation of posthuman subjectivities Thirdly I will discuss current transformations of the humanities These transformations are on the one hand obviously prompted by neoliberalist quests for commodiﬁcation and demands that humanist research show utilitarist use value On the other hand they are also gener

other animals historically materially and culturally And more speciﬁcally how can we under stand such relations in feminist terms Animals play crucial roles in human lives we use them for food clothing medical research entertainment education recrea tion Moreover we mirror ourselves in other animals in them we see similarity and difference and thus also our own superiority The complex shifting and often contradictory relationships between us and other species are the focus of a growing area of academic inquiry known as humananimal studies HAS here we draw on this research to consider what a focus on humananimal relations brings to feminist theory Both feminism and animal politics have concerns with questions of power albeit in different ways how then can they inﬂuence each other As feminist theory has expanded its remit and embraced diversity it has chal lenged the position of humanity as the center of all life on earth and come to recognize the interconnected exploitations of different humans as well as other animals nature and terra at large Here we will outline three areas that in our view connect feminism and animal studies and raise questions for both These are identity politics embodiment and accountability  including the related ques tion of rights There are of course other areas that could possibly be explored affect voicing control etc What we want to do is to point out a few fruitful inter connections Through exploring these connections and disconnections between the L Birke Dept Biological Science University of Chester Parkgate Rd Chester

Braidotti eds A Feminist Companion to the Posthumanities httpsdoiorg1010079783319621401_10 interdisciplinary ﬁelds of feminist and humananimal studies we argue for an inter sectionality which includes species Like feminist studies HAS involves multidisciplinary inquiry What HAS brings is a speciﬁc focus on animals and humans in relation it takes nonhuman animals seriously as subjects who engage or not with humans in multiple ways Such mutual embodied communication is crucial to our relationships with what Haraway 2003 2008 calls companion species Using the example of humandog relations she emphasizes our mutual embeddedness in histories of shared engage ments and calls for a relational ethics We humans relate to dogs in multiple and intersecting ways not only through onetoone friendships with particular dogs but also through enfolding with them at many levels in networks of connections from breeders and pet food manufacturers to park wardens Bringing animals into focus as social actors raises many issues for humanities social science and politics  all of which have traditionally excluded them This exclusion has been true also for feminism Yet although the trajectories of femin ist concerns and humananimal studies have been different and there is sometimes tension between them we believe that there is a strong kinship and a theoretical base for understanding interspecies relationships in feminist terms This can entail multiple spaces and scales from global to interpersonal levels in institutions or organizations from historical to contemporary or even future concerns Humananimal relationships are profoundly connected to other oppressions including sexism Cudworth 2011 Connections between gender and animality have been explored by several ecofeminist writers eg Adams 1990 Gaard 2011 who have pointed to the ways that both women and animals become subordinated Alongside that work there has also been resistance to naturalizing ideologies espe cially those that imply linkages between animality and women Relatedly the sex gender distinction has contributed to the disconnections with animal theory Holmberg 2008 46 Animals like sex were seen as ﬁrmly belonging to nature But that division has been challenged in many ways from acknowledgement of the cultures of for example laboratory animals Birke 2003 Holmberg 2011 to Haraways insistence on the entwinement of naturecultures Haraway 2008 to Haywards recognition of crossspecies perception in encounters with marine life Hayward 2010 Hayward and AhKing this volume There is now more recognition that human exceptionalism is itself a socially constituted order  a naturalized ideol ogy  which can be understood as maintaining speciﬁc social norms Yet there are limitations to this work Deckha 2012 for example argues that feminist interven tions around species have made insufﬁcient impact on animal activism and ethics and have not been sufﬁciently intersectional sometimes excluding race and culture Here intersectionality may provide a promising feminist posthumanist approach to humananimal relations taking account of various forms of naturalized social orders Feminist theories of intersectionality offer ways to explore complex relations of gender race class and sexuality They are not however unproblematic Lykke 2005 McWeeny 2014  not least because they generally disregard nonhu mans and rarely consider how human power is materially constituted through animal bodies It is precisely these considerations that HAS can contribute to feminist L Birke and T Holmberg inquiry How can we consider the interaction of multiple identities and experiences of exclusion and subordination Davis 2008 67 if we take species into account How good are our theories at recognizing our situation as one species among many This is a considerable challenge as feminism has dealt little with species diversity or explored how exploitation of nonhumans crosscuts and coconstitutes other systems of oppression Such questions can greatly enrich feminist thinking We can view human animal relationships as intersectional and performative such that species intersects with genderclassrace and other structures of power see Cudworth 2011 Human animal relationships can be seen as performed and animaled Birke Bryld and Lykke 2004 they are intersectional rather than analogical meaning that different axes of power relations intersect transforming practices and discourses In what follows we explore three areas in which feminist and animal studies share common ground in order to highlight intersectional connections Identity Politics Pivotal to understanding humananimal relations as intersectional is to understand species as kin in itself as relational Charles 2014 Many of us live in multispe cies households raising questions about how sociality is constituted and how categories are negotiated Our relationships with animal companions are more over freighted with ideas of gender and identity for example with horses Birke and Brandt 2009 Here we focus on one example where gender intersects with ideas of animality and family around women and cats The phrase cat lady  title of a Canadian documentary 2008  can invoke a lascivious feline image or it can imply someone who lives with many cats The latter is often seen as lonely ill or crazy with a void ﬁlled by cats Two contrast ing womancat relationships emerge in the documentary One is epitomized by Margot who returns home from work to her three cats Her apartment features cat portraits and show rosettes and thus portrays her through her interspecies relation ship The cats appear wellgroomed content Margot arrives and talks to them so that they appear as her valued family But only up to a point Speaking of her lack of human friends she says sadly a lot of people dont know that I am as lonely as I am Cat Ladies 2008 For her loneliness cats are inadequate substitutes The second example is epitomized by Diane and her 132 cats They live unsur prisingly in chaos some in cages but many running around behind furniture or under beds Diane too moves constantly feeding cleaning giving medications Recognizing that it has got out of hand Diane says she must stop helping the cats and start thinking of herself she appears to have lost control of her life and the cats now control her Like other cat hoarders she is unable to care for her animals  or herself Here there are not only intersections of humannessfemininity and animalityfelinity but representations are also intersected with age social class and place for extended discussion see Holmberg 2015 Intersections The Animal Question Meets Feminist Theory The ﬁlm exploits several interspecies intersectional identity markers Diane is stressed rushing around like her cats but she is also portrayed as a victim of circumstances Gender and class interact with this animaling process so that Diane becomes a helpless woman in relation to the cats who take over Margot in contrast appears as an inadequate woman who mothers cats instead of children Moreover the place called home looks very different in these two stories Margots apartment seems feminine intersecting with her cat mothering identity while Dianes chaotic house is dominated by the lives of the cats producing a troublesome identity  a woman without a home yet not homeless When these cat ladies appear as home bound irrational and out of control they seem to lose something of their human status And if they lose humanness because of their lack of conspeciﬁc relationships the cats lose their petness Hissing cats in cages conﬂict with ideas of domesticated docile pussycats But even the human made babied cat breaks with the ideal image of the pet The examples clearly show that pet categories as well as human ones are contingent positions  their boundaries can be moved and renegotiated Holmberg 2015 Redmalm 2013 The cats in these stories emerge as both victims and abusers as well as sentient agents Feminist analyses of these embodied power relationships might question linkages between gender and sentimentality evident in these narratives From a HAS perspective we might add that representations of cats as frivolous deceitful or magical on the one hand and mothering and homely on the other  intersect with historical split identities of the feminine as sexually uncontrollablevirtuous mother The category of human is ideologically historically and practically contingent on separation from yet dependent upon nonhumanity Similarly the category of animal is multiple and gendered Representations structure and are structured by normative narratives about humans animals nature and society Haraway points out that narratives should be understood in terms of their materialsemiotic presences and effects 2008 in constructing an identity of animal we produce human exceptiona lism It is ironic that as feminist theory has strongly emphasised difference it has so easily reproduced the animal other as a singularity And this is a political move As Peggs 2012 argues human is a political identity precisely when it is mobilized in opposition to the interests of other animals However as the brief example on cat ladies above is intended to highlight identities are multiple and ﬂuent Intersectionality in our view must include a broader critical approach to modernity puriﬁcation taxo nomies and identity politics and aim at providing alternative subversive performances Thus there is a pressing need to extend our theorizing to take seriously multiple subjectivities whoever they are and morethanhuman dynamics and embodiments Embodiment  Intercorporeality Embodiment has long mattered to feminist theorizing In HAS too scholars have sought to understand how corporeality and affect impact upon interspecies com munication eg Acampora 2006 Donovan 2007 Both have invoked the idea of L Birke and T Holmberg intercorporeality to reference how bodies can affect one another in many con texts Between species this might for example include the incorporation of one body into another through food consumption Buller 2012 it might include the myriad relations implied by companion species Haraway 2008 or Haywards 2008 description of the impressions of cup corals and scientists It can also encompass close tactile onetoone physical activities such as horse riding Birke and Hockenhull 2015 Smith 2011 These diverse contexts convey the profound embodiment of social relations whether with people or other animals communicating especially with nonverbal others young children nonhuman animals means using the body becoming intercorporeal  what Smart 2011 refers to as bodily ways of knowing enacted through the body It is precisely those embodied ways of knowing that matter for our engagement with nonhuman animals they can mediate interspecies communi cation as well as making power explicit through the body and its comportment cf Butler 19931 In perceiving others actions we engage with them to become within these social encounters is also to become a body and to make oneself available to the becomings of others whoever they are and whatever their perceptual skills2 This entails not only reading and understanding bodies across species lines but also movingaffecting other bodies and allowing oneself to be movedaffected in turn Despret 2004 The resulting multisensory dialogue is evident when we watch humans and dogs interacting eg Sanders 1999 Irvine 2004 Higgin 2012 in his study of guide dogs and their people actions of human and nonhuman are not forced but coproduced3 Even when the person walks alongside movements may be coordinated Birke and Hockenhull 2015  a kind of bodily meshing in which horse and person pay attention and work together There is a mutual entwining here reﬂecting neuromuscular patterns as well as mutual affect Agents are not bounded individuals in this view but spill over into others experiences directly affecting each other Stuart 2013 314 speaks of a union between two nervous systems implicit in ways that teachers of postural techniques work with clients in coactivity She emphasizes bodily mutuality depending upon interindividual physiological resonances In the intercorporeality of humananimal relationships there is similarly a dialogical relation a neuromus cular dynamical ﬂow Although multisensory it is particularly affected and effected by touch The shared balletic ﬂows of horse and rider in dressage for example emerge from tactile sensations shared histories and understandings as well as physiological capabilities see Lagarde et al 2005 Although intercorpore ality is emphasized even eulogized in both HAS and feminist writing its mean ing often remains nebulous If horse and human or person and dog are moving together there are profound material changes going on biological ﬂows which both produce and are produced by the encounter and which transcend the indivi dual bodies there might for instance be echoing changes in nervous system func tion immune responses or hormone release4 Despite earlier fears about essentialism feminist theorists are now much more willing to engage with biology to refuse to put it into boxes and to think of the body as highly permeable and plastic Frost 2010 Shildrick 2010 These diverse insights could open up interesting ideas for HAS particularly for those of us whose focus is close interspecies encounters What precisely does it mean when riders speak of feel for the horse in terms of bodily experiencing through mus cles nerves sinews Certainly animals often readily pick up nonverbal and unin tentional cues from human bodies horses for instance increase their heart rate if the human handlers heart rate goes up Slight changes in human muscle tension are easily apparent to the animal even if all that links them is a lead rope Feminist theory around embodiment with its growing willingness to think across divides can offer insights into humananimal relationships as intercorporeal So too can animals contribute to feminist thinking First for example the exquisite sensitivity of many nonhumans to our actions even before we do them underscores the importance of nonverbal bodily ways of knowing which produce coactions Such crossspecies mutuality challenges individual human cognition and rational 3We acknowledge here that there is some degree of domination in that animals have fewer choices and are located ﬁrmly within a sociocultural framework in which animals are indeed dominated and abused Nevertheless there are possibilities sometimes for companion animals to experience pleasure in relatings with us see Cudworth 2011  and perhaps even to enjoy shared activities 4The hormone oxytocin for example often called the bonding hormone is released by both dog and person when they gaze at each other Nagasawa et al 2015 L Birke and T Holmberg language as the bases for sociality Secondly thinking about nonhuman animal embodiment challenges intersectionality as McWeeny 2014 emphasized Debates about intersectionality she argues can lose sight of speciﬁc bodily experiences harms She draws on ideas from ecofeminism and the colonialgender system to argue that our bodies are related to that of others through lines of intercorporeal relations that collectively form topographies of ﬂesh ibid 269 For McWeeny these lines of intercorporeality include nonhumans whose bodies experiences and oppressions are as fully implicated as those of humans In addition HAS scholars have shown how humans too have the ability to sense the wellbeing of other animals through their bodily demeanor Wemelsfelder 2012 These intercorporeal sensations are of course embedded in webs of power  For exam ple returning to the cat ladies above the interplay of knowing and sensing works in relation to the phenomenon of cat and dog hoarding assessment through sensuous governance Holmberg 2014 reinforcing hegemonic norms of proper living and humananimal relations based on sensually constructed knowledge This term refers to the ways in which experts use sensing through seeing hearing feeling and snifﬁng as a means of knowledge and as a method of management knowledge senses and power go hand in hand However animals play important roles in the governance of hoarding In the hoarding context cats and dogs also perform certain feralness most often refusing to collaborate with authorities Ideas about intercorporeality and inter species impressions can thus contribute to intersectionality  especially when interspe cies encounters are taken into account Various human and animal bodies  in this particular case cats human authorities of different kinds and socalled hoarders  interact and produce knowledge about the situation As in the case of humanhorse relations above intercorporeality is produced in between human and nonhuman actors albeit within different degrees of freedom between intersecting axes of power Power and Responsibility How can we understand power relations as both producing and constraining issues of life and death If nonhuman animals are crucially part of social life then there are moral implications To what extent can they be accorded rights even citizen ship Discourses of animal rights are problematic ﬁrst they are based on negative rights rather than saying anything about positive relational duties see Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011 Second from feminist perspectives Braidotti 2008 106 Responsibility Haraway points out builds on response Such a capacity can be shared only in and for multidirectional relationships in which always more than one responsive coactor is in the process of becoming That means that human beings are not uniquely obligated to and gifted with responsibility animals as workers in labs animals in all their worlds are responseable in the same sense that people are that is responsibility is a relationship crafted in intraaction through which entities subjects and objects come into being Haraway 2008 71 Humans and other animals are thus responseable meaning that since they have capacities to respond they also need to be responsible Although Haraways terminology might suggest that relations are non hierarchical she acknowledges that they are embedded in power see Cudworths 2011 critique of Haraway and that interests will always conﬂict Taking this stand point seriously it means that humans in general have a greater responseability for humanimal relations Having responsibilityresponseability implies an ethic of care For example Donovan and Adams write that attention is a key term when it comes to a feminist ethics of care including attention to the political and economic sys tems that are causing the suffering Donovan and Adams 2007 3 Systems that cause suffering include meat production thus they argue for vegan feminism Unlike Haraways demand for responsible practices they  as many other feminists writing about animals  see food production as inherently violent eg Adams 1990 Curtin 2007 Donovan 2007 Food practices they argue must be seen as part of a feminist ethics for these authors responsibility means avoiding using animals for food alto gether Relatedly having responsibility implies political and social obligations Animals in general may not be able to resist their oppression collectively though some do individually with varying success It has been argued that nonhuman animals fruitfully can be viewed as cocitizens Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011 as members of a shared social life eg companion animals or whose sovereignty should be respected animals in the wild To think about other species as part of our collective social lives is to think intersectionally5 HAS like feminism has roots in political activism Whatever position one takes in relation to animal politics there is a principle behind it of trying to organize politically on behalf of animals  of trying to do something for animals  which matters To have an ethics of care to be responsible also means being accountable  in academic terms that includes accountability to the subjects of our inquiries This issue has been much discussed among feminist scholars debating how to do respon sible research that is accountable to the people studied Skeggs 2001 Accountable research feminists usually argued was research that rejected objectivist assumptions that researchers could stand apart from their subjects It was furthermore research which involved the subjects at different stages as well as involving the researcher in the communities being investigated 5However this perspective could be accused of speaking to the same liberal ontology that we argued against above What would a politics that can take collectives into account look like see Holmberg 2015 L Birke and T Holmberg There is an ethics of care implicit in these feminist debates about accountability which could usefully inform HAS see Birke 2009 However much we study humananimal relationships we might also ask whats in it for animals To think about that question is not only to ponder what they might think about it but also to consider whether our investigations can help to bring about change  in the ways we think about them and their abilities in the ways we treat them in the ways we respect  or not  the places they live Accountability is not easy and there are inevitably imbalances of power  whether those studied are human or not In this context it is important to remember Spivaks 2006 theorizing on the subaltern and the voices that they are being denied Shouldcould we ever speak for them Nevertheless we would argue that accountability is an important issue that animal studies scholars can usefully glean from feminism see Birke 2009 It is moreover also the question of account ability to others including nonhuman others that continues to provide a signiﬁcant challenge to feminist scholarship we would argue It is not enough to talk about how our lives connect with those of other species if we remain oblivious to the poli tics of such relationships  essentially one of exploitation This would simply be an intellectual exercise leaving our theorizing unaccountable We need of course to keep in mind that although our relations with other species are primarily exploitative embedded in myriad layers of domination there may also be affection and love within speciﬁc relations  as many of us who share our lives with companion species would attest see Cudworth 2011 And to complicate the picture further feminist thinkers have taught us that love and care does not exclude power relations On the contrary caring relations are by deﬁnition asymmetric although not always in ways we can predict Conclusion Humananimal studies and posthumanist feminism have many in our view under explored intersecting points of interest Power relations naturalized ideological and capitalist systems as well as more cultural and symbolic dimensions bring the two areas together Despite this while gender and feminism have had at least some impact on the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of animal studies the role of other animals in feminist theory has been a rather invisible one What HAS largely recognizes is the sentience agency and cultures of nonhuman animals Abilities to feel and suffer or to work and play together  to thrive matter Haraway 2008 In Haraways view part of that lesson is to stop thinking about humans and animals as culture and nature as us and them and to start considering all rela tions as intersectional 2008 18 Species race and gender are relational rather than analogous Women for example are not treated like animals in porno graphy and trafﬁcking similarly industrial meat production systems including abattoirs are not like Nazi concentration camps These and other profoundly troubling phenomena must be analyzed in their own context otherwise we will Intersections The Animal Question Meets Feminist Theory contribute to the downgrading of other animals and as a paradoxical consequence of downgrading humans while losing some essential insights into humanimal becomings in that speciﬁcities may be lost This is why debates about intersectiona lity need to take into account all those who can feel or engage with others whatever their gender race  or species These other sentient creatures coproduce sociality and culture alongside us Bekoff 2002 and we should properly recognize that mutuality in our politics and consider its implications6 If we emphasize intersectionality in posthumanities research and feminist post humanist theorizing and seek to understand the multiple and complex ways that power structures cut across or complement each other then we must recognize where other species are situated in those power structures This is where insights from HAS scholarship can help to inform feminist inquiry not only does HAS work to trace the complex ways in which nonhuman lives are entwined with human ones but its activist connections remind us of the politics Nonhuman animals in our technoindustrial world are increasingly commodiﬁed and disem powered Similarly certain categories of humans are dehumanized and disempow ered The anthropological machine that produces the contingent boundaries surrounding the category of the human Agamben 2004 works in both ways Indeed it is precisely for this reason that we are wary of some versions of posthu manist scholarship whatever the philosophical promises posthumanist theorizing risks overemphasizing the political potentials of transgressing bodily boundaries through for example biotechnology without reﬂecting on the patterns which allows some bodily boundaries to become transgressed without consent This is where feminist theorizing is crucial keeping a critical eye on the multiple power relations producing knowledge bodies and cultural representations in certain directions and not others It is equally important that feminists engage with emerging debates about the cognition sentience and emotions of other animals Bekoff 2002 as is currently being done in other ﬁelds within new material feminism see Braidotti 2008 Shildrick 2010 Alaimo this volume Hird this volume To ignore nonhuman animals or to allocate them to an unchanging nature is to engage through natura lizing ideologies as acultural or even asocial and that is a political move serving to reinforce human domination It is not compassionate nor subversive And nor can politics which excludes power relations regarding species be called a feminist politics We have a strong conviction  and hope  that we will see more of human animal relations in feminist research with the current posthumanist and materialist turn 6There is growing recognition of animal sentience in legislative systems  European legislation for example acknowledges animal sentience But there are also increasing demands for at least some species to be accorded rights broadly analogous to human rights great apes for instance For further discussion of the issue of animals and citizenship see Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011 L Birke and T Holmberg" .

Butthis vital principle is not clear in the nineteenthcentury sdentific debate 1 can infer two directions important for my discussion on the living and that set apart grosso modo two philosophical trends the vitaIist and the materialist 1 life coming from the special arrangementof elements is like a spontaneous force in itself coming from withinmaterialist 2 life is a force insuffiated to matter as an outside factor given by GodNature  vital ist Claude Bernard the French physiqlogist held strongly to the idea oforga nization and even if he could not explain it further he was close to what the first half of twentieth century came up with  Another aspect of life was the teleological condition the final cases life has agoal organic matter is work ing in that direction Qrganization

Manifesto Science Tephnology and Socialist Copyright 2011 ProOuest LLC All rights reserved Copyright University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College Department of English Cyborg as Problematic Signifier Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century As a parallel then looking at litera ture of the nineteenth century even if the concept of cyborg did not exist we can still find some comparable figures of the thorization f manmachine and manorganismthe monster in Frankenstein Dracula  either dead or alive and the representationofhuman in Zolasle Docteur Pascal In other words these monsters from the past could come back in our postmodern culture and claim their new identity and rights as cyborgs and not just as the other And this is a big difference between cyborg and other The cyborg as Haraway keeps defining it is the postmodern constructthat transgresses challenges and subverts traditional dichotomies that ensured se curity control and domination over natureculture malefemale mjndbody naturalartificial machineorganism humannonhuman etcThe cyborg refuses unity odgin and stability it does not trust the Father and breaks definitely with the Mother It is an antiOedipus it is an illegitimate offspring refusingthe Fathers systemthat has to question also the Mother since the latter is part of the system the cyborg tries to destabilize The cyborgs position is that of the other fighting the system from within and as such it is frightening The cyborgs discourse is that of difference its politics of transgressionsubversion ani its social identity gives it no roots It is more than an illegitimate offspring it is an orphean beingitsown origin and its own end Haraway gives an interesting list correspondingtothe cyborg world inwhich dichotomies may be

there Copyright 2011 ProQuest LLC All rights reserved Copyright University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College Department of English Cyborg as Problematic Signifier is discontinuity in space and continuity intime My argument isthat the cyborg standing for living points at subjectivity that as a concept is relying on the Cartesian and Newtonian epistemology and as such it shows a crisis This oh jectified subjectivity then has tobe questioned Thns since the cyborg destabilizes our sense of ontology andjdentity some thing has happenedin the tableau ofnature and made a change

this shift mirrors that one between the eighteenth and nineteenth century  The salient point here inmyargmnent is that similarityanalogy as a mode of thinking is still central inthe tableau of nature and in this postmodern era similarity appears through the disguiSyd form of the metaphor of the cyborg At the riskto boldly go where no one has gone be fore I would say that metaphor making the

anthropomorphism To equate life with subjectivity is to go back before a Copernicianrevolution and put humans at the center of the world I would say with Haraway lhat the cyborg construct of postmodern culture is necessary to deconstruct boundaries and to open a new space of subjectivityidentity However in the way it is represented in the ques tion of living the cyborg is a discursive space where the crisis of postmodern thought occurs In both Star Trek and Blade Runner there is a subjectivity objectified in psycllOanalytical terms and as such it reinstalls the Cartesian and Newtonian epistemology in the tableau of nature The question of ontology should be a matter of discursive subjectivity tharwhich concerns the space of representa tion and not the tableau itself The discursive subjectivity is notthe focalized the object represented in the tibleau butthe focalization the tnode ofthinking that allows any object to be represented or to exist lnthat respect the discur sive subjectivity in Star Trek andBlade Runner is this discursive space opened by the concept of similarity that reveals the Cartesian and Newtonianepiste mology In a postmodern culture and cyberspace world the question of living is a matter ofmetaphor that needs to be questioned Infact the metaphor opens a crisis and a transference between machine and organism in which the objecti fied subjectivity through Freudian andLacanian models is at stake As a result the cyborg becomes a problematic signifier pointing at the impossibility to over come the dichotomies Cyborg as Problematic Signifier vidual essentially the same as itself   and finally what might be called closure that is the production of every living being through the sole action of the biological forces animating a progenitor of its own nature Lestienne 144 3 The dichotomies are usually humannonhuman and organismmachineAt times they overlap such as humanmachine By pointing at humanorganism I refer to an association of concept that do not oppose each other as previous associations do As such humanorganism points to an anthropomorphism 4 This expression is taken from Foucaults The Order of Things  It

Androids lies in his portrayal of a society in which humanlike robots have emerged at the same time as advances that make people more pliable and predictable like machines The film eschews the intricacies of plot that bring this to the fore in the book Dick 192882 was in many ways as paradoxical as his work He read widely and was well versed in the science of his day such as the cybernetics of Norbert Wiener Yet his formal education ended with school Shortly after enrolling at the University of California Berkeley in 1949  to study subjects includ ing philosophy  he dropped out possibly owing to the vertigo and agoraphobia that troubled him throughout his life The pop ular image of him which he encouraged was of a hallucinogenaddled mystic But it was amphetamines that fuelled Dicks most heroic bouts of productivity in 196364 he wrote 6 novels in 12 months His extraordi narily fecund imagination did the rest Dick wrote Androids in 1966 Others of his books such as Ubik 1969 and his great alternative history The Man in the High Castle 1962 were also garlanded with praise Yet none has perhaps so viscerally affected researchers as Androids Set in a postapocalyptic 1992 the book follows bounty hunter Rick Deckard in a risky mission to retire destroy six state oftheart Nexus6 androids who have fled to Earth after killing their human mas ters in a Martian colony Nexus6s can be distinguished from humans through the VoightKampff test This assesses capacity for empathy a human facility that even the most intelligent androids lack Deckard embarks on the hunt amid dreams of buying a pet with the reward Nuclear fallout has extinguished most ani mal life and pets are major status symbols Lifelike robotic animals abound such as the blackfaced sheep that Deckard owns but they are ultimately disappointing Through caring for an authentic beast he and his wife Iran hope to transcend the existential fug of living on a planet abandoned by all but the dregs of humanity Adherents of the religion Mercerism they feel bound to share such transcendental experiences with others by means of an empathy box a machine that meshes human consciousness These days academic discourse around the work dwells on what distinguishes humans from sophisticated robots  driven by the film Dicks approach was more nuanced The name Deckard for instance echoes that of seventeenthcentury French philosopher René Descartes who asked whether it was possible to distinguish with out direct access to their minds a human from an automaton Deckard explores that ambiguity

among others has argued that granting autonomous robots legal personhood would be a mistake it would render their makers unaccountable Bryson an admirer of the book believes that the mass production of machines with humanlike goals and ambitions should be prohibited But Dicks chief preoccupation in Androids is not the almosthuman robot as moral subject His synthetic beings are inhu man in

of the absolute end of Man What Jacques Derrida calls the apocalyptic tone1 should be toned down a little for as Nietzsche once pointed out it is remarkably difficult to cut off the humanist head through which we continue to behold all things 1996 15 While I am not for one moment interested in preserving humanism keeping its head firmly on its shoulders I do think that it is worth remembering the tale of the Lernaean hydra the mythical beast that of course remembers itself The hydra throve on its wounds Ovid recalls and none of its hundred heads could be cut off with impunity without being

heads N Katherine Hayles has of course done much to reveal the dangers of what might be called apocalyptic or complacent posthu manism2 This in fact is precisely where How We Became Posthuman commences This book began with a roboticists dream that struck me as mare I was reading Hans Moravecs Mind Children The Future and Human Intelligence enjoying the ingenious variety of his when I happened upon the passage where he argues it will soon sible to download human consciousness into a computer To illus invents a fantasy scenario in which a robot surgeon purees th brain in a kind of cranial liposuction reading the information molecular layer as it is stripped away and transferring the inf into a computer At the end of the operation the cranial cavity i and the patient now inhabiting the metallic body of the comput ens to find his consciousness exactly the same as it was before How I asked myself was it possible for someone of Moravecs obvious intelligence to believe that mind could be separated from body Even assuming such a separation was possible how could anyone think that consciousness in an entirely different medium would remain un changed as if it had no connection with embodiment Shocked into awareness I began to notice he was far from alone 1999 1 Moravec Hayles concludes is not abandoning the autonomous lib eral subject but is expanding its prerogatives into the realm of the posthuman 287 for the seemingly posthumanist desire to down load consciousness into a gleaming digital environment is itself downloaded from the distinctly humanist matrix of Cartesian dual ism Humanism survives the apparent apocalypse and more worry ingly fools many into thinking that it has perished Rumors of its death are greatly exaggerated3 Moravecs fatally seductive narrative does not of course exhaust the meanings of the posthuman Hayles 1999 283 and How We Be came Posthuman offers an admirably nuanced approach that seeks to avoid the lethal  grafting of the posthuman onto a liberal humanist This content downloaded from 1552304416 on Thu 30 Jan 2025 151419 UTC All use subject to httpsaboutjstororgterms view of the self 28687 What remains to haunt the book however is the possibility that humanism will haunt or taint posthumanism and it is precisely this problem that will concern me herea problem of what remains a problem of remains4 If Hayless project is to imag ine a posthumanism that does not fall into the kind of trap that ensnares Moravec mine is slightly different though not unrelated involving instead an attention to what of humanism itself persists insists and ultimately desists5 I want in short to ask an apparently straightforward question with deliberately Leninist overtones if traces of humanism find their way into even the most apocalyptic accounts of the posthumanist condition what is to be done BOTH SIDES NOW OR WHY ET WANTED TO GO HOME I chose to begin the introduction to my book on posthumanism with a reference to an image from the cover of Time that I have since real ized raises the problem of humanist remains Badmington 2000 Introduction 1 The issue in question dates from the first week of January 1983 when according to the Timehonored tradition the magazine was expected to announce its Man of the Year There was however something strange about the winner Several human can didates might have represented 1982 the magazines publisher explained to his readers but none symbolized the past year more richly or will be viewed by history as more significant than a machine the computer6 There had of course been previous years in which the honor was not strictly speaking bestowed upon a real person GI Joe towered over 1950 while Middle Americans dutifully represented 1969 for instance but this time something far more dramatic had occurred Humans had failed to leave their mark7 Man of the Year had given way to Machine of the Year and what looked like humanisms epitaph loomed over the covers striking scene The computer moves in The event did not go unnoticed Three weeks later Times letters page carried over thirty responses to the award Only a handful of the readers who chose to write in were happy with the magazines decision Irving Kullback of New Jersey was one of these I never dreamed he gushed that Times Man of the Year would be living This content downloaded from 1552304416 on

Allston Massachusetts while Ohios Joseph Hoelscher finally understood the real meaning of the box office success of the year Your cover rele gates man to a papiermache dummy and glorifies a machine No wonder ET wanted to go home8 These irate readers need not have worried too much about Man He was still alive still in the picture Quite literally in as I realized several months after submitting the manuscript of humanism to the publishers In my haste to draw attention to obvious headline and the presence of the computer at the cen of the picture I had overlooked the significance of the somew pathetic anthropomorphic figure that sat to the left looking Here in the margins of the image another side of the story be emerge Why if the computer has moved in should there b human witness What might such an onlooker reveal about the apparent apocalypse If technology has truly sped us outside and beyond the space of humanism why is Man still at our side If Man is present at his own funeral how can he possibly be dead What looks on lives on The end of Man was suddenly in doubt I had come up against the problem of what to do with human remains Margins Remains The inside and the outside Death This already sounds a lot like the work of Jacques Derrida a theorist whose work I want to bring to bear on the question of posthuman ism Although he was writing at the same time and in the same city as explicitly antihumanist thinkers like Lacan Foucault and Althusser Derrida took a somewhat different approach arguing that simply because thought always takes place within a certain tra dition thought itself is bound to bear some trace of that tradition No one can think himself or herself entirely without In The Ends of Man an essay first published in 1968 he turned his attention to the manner in which some of his contemporaries were conducting their questioning of humanism 1982 117 by affirming an abso lute break and absolute difference from established anthropocentric This content

force and the efficiency of tradi tion effect a stricter and more naive reinstatement of the new terrain on the oldest ground 135 The outside carries the inside beyond the apparent apocalypse The new now secretes the old then Humanism remains Unease with what he would later term the apocalyptic tone does not however mark the end of Derridas critique Neither doe it lead to a call for a simple return or surrender to the humanism that had dominated French philosophy in the postwar years largely under the guidance of JeanPaul Sartre12 There is Derrida propose another way to question humanism and this involves attempting the exit and the deconstruction without changing terrain by repeating what is implicit in the founding concepts and the original problematic by using against the edifice the instruments or stones available in the house that is equally in language The risk here is one of ceaselessly confirming consolidating relifting relever at an always more certain depth that which one claims to be deconstructing The continuous process of making explicit moving towards the opening risks sinking risque de senfoncer into the autism of the closure 13513 Alone however this is still not enough and Derrida goes on to sug gest that there is no simple and unique 135 choice to be made between the two methods of challenging humanism A new writ ing he concludes must weave and interlace the two motifs 13514 and the apocalyptic desire to leap wholly beyond needs to be married to the recognition that the outside bears with the inside a relationship that is as usual anything but simple exteriority 1976 35 This in short amounts to saying that it is necessary to speak several languages and produce several texts at once 1982 13515 The ease of speed and the speed of ease had found themselves called into question Given the unfashionable status of antihumanist theory at the pre sent moment it would be easy to argue that we do not really need Derrida to tell us in an essay written some time ago that the anti humanists were somewhat wide of the mark Their moment the story so often goes has passed Why would cultural critics interested in posthumanism want to bother with Derridas

Cyborgs and Women Haraway 1991 How We Became Posthuman Hayles 1999 Cyborg Citizen Gray 2001 and Rep resentations of the PostHuman Graham 2002 I do however want to bring Derrida into the picture to theorize posthumanism from a posi tion made possible by his work I think that Derridas reluctance to be seduced by the apocalyp tic tone bears repeating today as posthumanism begins to find its feet within the academy16 It seems to me that many are a little too quick to affirm an absolute break with humanism and a little too reluctant to attend to what remains of humanism in the posthuman ist landscape17 From one perspective this is perfectly understand able posthumans are far more exciting far sexier than humans To misquote Haraway I for one would rather go to bed with a cyborg than a Man of reason18 But someone has to do the dirty work humanism requires attention and as my argument unfolds I hope to show why this phrase should be understood in all its senses The familiar easy announcements of a complete change of terrain a pure outside need to be complemented by work that speaks to human isms ghost to the reappearance of the inside within the outside Both halves of the signifier in question demand attention posthumanism as I have argued elsewhere is as much posthumanist as it is post humanist 2001 1319 This should not be read as a regressive or reactionary gesture To engage with humanism to acknowledge its persistence is not neces sarily to support humanism Derridas call for critics to repeat what is implicit in the founding concepts and the original problematic is by no means a demand for a simple straightforward repetition of those concepts Deconstruction rather as he has insisted on various occasions consists in repeating things in a certain way21 in order to expose the overwhelming uncertainty of even the most apparently certain discourses If the version of posthumanism that I am trying to develop here repeats humanism it does so in a certain way and with a view to the deconstruction of anthropocentric thought If the pure out side is a myth it is nonetheless possible to lodge oneself within traditional conceptuality in order to destroy it Derrida 1978 Vio lence 111 to reveal the internal instabilities the fatal contradictions This content downloaded from 1552304416 on Thu 30 Jan 2025 151419 UTC All use subject to

there may be a fine line between insurrection and resurrection the risk I think must be measured against the alternative for as Hayles shows so well there is nothing more terrifying than a posthumanism that claims to be terminating Man while actually extending his term in office DESCARTESS MONKEY OR SIMIANS CARTESIANS AND PRIMATE REVISIONS How might this somewhat abstract theory actually be put into prac tice I have tried elsewhere to work through some of the implications of my approach with reference to Marge Piercys Body of Glass also known as He She and It and Don Siegels Invasion of the Body Snatch ers Badmington 2000 Posthumanist 2001 Here however I want to travel further back in time to the seventeenth century and a figure who might well be called one of the founders of humanism When Descartes writes about what it means to be human his words exude certainty security and mastery Near the beginning of the Discourse on the Method for instance reason is held aloft as the only thing that makes us men and distinguishes us from the beasts 1988 21 This essential power of judging well and distinguishing the true from the false  is naturally equal in all men 20 and it is precisely this ability to determine the truth that convinces Descartes of his human being I think therefore I am 3621 The truth of the human of what it means to be human lies that is to say in the rational mind or soul22 which is entirely distinct from the body Next examining attentively what I was and seeing that I could pretend that I had no body and that there was neither world nor place where I was but that I could not for all that pretend that I did not exist and that on the contrary simply because I was thinking about doubting the truth of other things it followed quite evidently and certainly that I existed whereas if I had merely ceased thinking even if everything else I had imagined had been true I should have had no reason to believe that I existed I knew from there that I was a substance whose whole essence This content downloaded from 1552304416 on Thu 30 Jan 2025 151419 UTC All use subject to httpsaboutjstororgterms THEORIZING POSTHUMANISM  17 or nature is solely to think and who in order to exist does not require any place or depend on any material thing So much so that this I that is to say the soul by which I am what I am is entirely distinct from the body Descartes 1988 Discourse on the Method 3623 Although the Meditations published four years after the Discourse on the Method concede that there is some kind of link between the mind and the body the fundamental dualism is soon reaffirmed When I consider the mind or myself in so far as I am merely a think ing thing I am unable to distinguish any parts within myself I under stand myself to be something quite single and complete Although the whole mind seems to be united to the whole body I recognize that if a foot or arm or any other part of the body is cut off nothing has thereby been taken away from the mind 1988 Meditations 120 The human being in this account is completely known knowable and present to the very being that is engaged in the meditation on what it means to be human As JeanFranqois Lyotard once put it the genre of firstperson narration chosen by Descartes to explain his method  confesses  the effort of the I to master every given including itself 1992 Missive 36 I think therefore I am But if Descartes is famous for his descriptions of the human he also told fascinating stories about the inhuman There is in fact a pas sage in the Discourse on the Method that reads to me like seventeenth century science fiction and not being a philosopher this is the only way that I really know how to approach Descartes24 If the argument runs there were a machine that looked like a monkey it would not be possible to distinguish between a real monkey and the fakeat the level of essencebecause the fact that neither the animal nor the machine could ever exercise rational thought means that there would be no essential difference Both figures are in Descartess eyes ulti mately inhuman If however machines were to attempt to simulate humans we would for two simple reasons always be able to tell the difference between the true and the false The first of these is that they could never use words or other signs com posing them as we do in order to declare our thoughts to others For we can certainly conceive of a machine so constructed that it utters words This content downloaded from 1552304416 on Thu 30 Jan 2025 151419 UTC All use subject to httpsaboutjstororgterms 18 1 NEIL BADMINGTON and even utters some regarding the bodily actions that cause certain changes in its organs for instance if you touch it in one spot it asks what you want to say to it if in another it cries out that you are hurting it and so on but not that it arranges them the words diversely to respond to the meaning of everything said in its presence as even the most stupid hebetes of men are capable of doing Secondly even though they might do some things as well as or even better than we do them they would inevitably fail in others through which we would discover that they were acting not through understanding connaissance but only from the disposition of their organs For whereas reason is a universal instrument which can be of use in all kinds of situations these organs need some particular disposition for each particular action hence it is impossible to conceive that there would be enough of them in a machine to make it act in all the occurrences of life in the way in which our reason makes us act 444525 The human in short is absolutely distinct from the inhuman over which it towers in a position of natural supremacy I think therefore I cannot possibly be an automaton But what if that wonderfully confident humanism pulled itself apart What if the ontological hygiene that Elaine L Graham 2002 locates at the heart of humanism were always already in crisis always already distinctly unhealthy Descartes asserts his anthropocentrism on the grounds that i would be impossible for a machine to possess enough different organs to enable it to respond to the infinite unpredictability of everyday life Sooner or later as countless subsequent science fiction narratives conveniently testify the truth will out Absolute and nat ural difference will eventually tell itself There is however something of a blind spot an aporia in Descartess account for if a machinein keeping with the spirit of his fantastic scenariowere constructed in such a way that it had what might be called an organ for every occa sion26 it would according to the letter of Descartess own argument no longer be possible to maintain a clear distinction between the human and the inhuman Given enough organs a machine would be capable of responding in a manner utterly indistinguishable from that of a human being Reason no longer capable of distinguishing us from the beasts would meet its match its fatal and flawless double On closer inspection in other words there lies within Descartess ontological hygiene a real sense in which to take

Refusing merely to ape the human it becomes a simian simulacrum a simulacrian if you will a copy for which there is no longer an original Humanism has slipped into posthumanism and the Discourse on the Method has begun to tell a story not unlike that of Haraways Simians Cyborgs and Women Anthropocentrism always already contains the conditions of its own transcendence28 Its structure to use Derridas words bears within itself the necessity of its own critique 1978 Structure 284 its inside turns itself inside out I think that the trickand this would certainly not be what Haraway calls a god trick 1991 189is to learn what the characters who experience the strange building in Mark Z Danielewskis House of Leaves 2000 know all too well the straightforward distinction between inside and outside is not always that straightforward29 The boundaries that ought to fall into line with common sense the laws of science and the land turn out to be far more uncertain Things are not what they seem The task of post humanism is to uncover those uncanny moments at which things start to drift of reading humanism in a certain way against itself and the grain This clearly involves a rethinking

understandings of the postmodern Essays such as Answer to the Question What Is the Postmodern 1992 and Note on the Meaning of Post 1992 repeatedly confounded popular opin ion by insisting among other things that the postmodern should not be seen as a historical period and even that postmodernity comes before modernity It is however to a text first published in 1987 that I want to turn here Rewriting Modernity opens with the suggestion that its title seems far preferable to the usual headings like postmodernity postmodernism postmodern under which this sort of reflection is usually placed Lyotard 1991 24 Developing his earlier insistence that the signifier postmodern simply indicates a mood or better a state of mind 198687 209 Lyotard goes on to declare that Postmodernity is not a new age but the rewriting of some of the fea tures claimed by modernity and first of all modernitys claim to ground its legitimacy on the project of liberating humanity as a whole through science and technology But as I have said that rewriting has been at work for a long time now in modernity itself 1991 34 Modernity and postmodernity that is to say should not be thought of as entirely distinct entities postmodernity is the rewriting of modern ity which is itself constitutionally and ceaselessly pregnant with its postmodernity 25 The post is forever tied up with what it is posting This is no cause for despair and should not for one moment be confused with Habermass claim that modernity is a project that still calls for and moreover is capable of completion30 Lyotards postmodern on the contrary attends to the modern in the name of questioning The re of the rewriting as he puts it in no way signifies a return to the beginning but rather what Freud called a working through 1991 26 The brief paper to which Lyotard is alluding at this point was composed in 1914 shortly after Freud had completed his analysis of the Wolf Man and makes an important theoretical distinction be tween remembering Erinnern repeating Wiederholen and working through Durcharbeitung The latter term refers to the delicate sit uation that arises when a patient initially resists the procedure of

become more conversant with this resistance with which he has now become acquainted to work through it to over come it by continuing in defiance of it the analytic work according to the fundamental rule of analysis Only when the resistance is at its height can the analyst working in common with his patient discover the repressed instinctual impulses which are feeding the resistance and it is this kind of experience which convinces the patient of the existence and power of such impulses The doctor has nothing else to do than to wait and let things take their course a course which cannot be avoided nor always hastened Freud 195374 155 emphasis in original The traumatic event cannot be remembered as such cannot be simply and surely represented to consciousness But neither can it be forgotten for if the patient could turn his or her back on the past he or she would not require the help of the analyst This strange condi tion this twilight zone is the predicament of anamnesis Faced with such a situation analysis must move slowly This workingthrough of the resistance Freud concludes may in practice turn out to be an arduous task for the subject of the analysis and a trial of patience for the analyst 155 There can be no simple settling of scores no sudden breaks with the troublesome past Lyotard is quick to heed Freuds warning Cultural analysis he proposes can learn from psychoanalysis Modernity that monstrous Thing with which postmodernity is trying to come to terms must be worked through patiently rewritten Rewriting as I mean it here obviously concerns the anamnesis of the Thing Not only that Thing that starts off a supposedly individual singularity but of the Thing that haunts the language the tradition and the material with against and in which one writes Lyotard 1991 33 And it is precisely this elaborate laborious labyrinthine rewriting that Lyotard names postmodernity I want to borrow Lyotards borrowing to carry italong with the work of Derridato the space of posthumanism31 Both thinkers it seems to me invite a careful reconsideration of the signifier in ques tion From a perspective informed by their thought the post of posthumanism

but must rather take the form of a critical practice that occurs inside human ism consisting not of the wake but the workingthrough of humanist discourse Humanism has happened and continues to happen to us it is the very Thing that makes us us in fact and the experi encehowever traumatic however unpleasantcannot be erased without trace in an instant The present moment may well be one in which the hegemony and heredity of humanism feel a little less certain a little less inevitable but there is I think a real sense in which the crisis as Gramsci once put it consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born 1971 276 The scene is changing but the guard is not Not yet not now A working through remains underway and this coming to terms is of course a gradual and

weight of tradition means a blindness toward things to come If to invoke Celan there are still songs to be sung beyond the human posthumanism marks the recognition that humanism always already in

greatest debt is to my family who have listened patiently to my ideas over the years and to my husband Nick Gessler from whom I have learned more than I can say Prologue You are alone in the room except for two computer terminals flickering in the dim light You use the terminals to communicate with two entities in an other room whom you cannot see Relying solely on their responses to your questions you must decide which is the man which the woman Or in an other version of the famous imitation game proposed by Alan Turing in his classic 1950 paper Computer Machinery and Intelligence you use the responses to decide which is the human which the machine 1 One of the entities wants to help you guess correctly Hisherlits best strategy Turing suggested may be to answer your questions truthfully The other entity wants to mislead you Hesheit will try to reproduce through the words that appear on your terminal the characteristics of the other entity Your job is to pose questions that can distinguish verbal performance from embodied reality If you cannot tell the intelligent machine from the intel ligent human your failure proves Turing argued that machines can think Here at the inaugural moment of the computer age the erasure of em bodiment is performed so that intelligence becomes a property of the formal manipulation of symbols rather than enaction in the human life world The Turing test was to set the agenda for artificial intelligence for the next three decades In the push to achieve machines that can think re searchers performed again and again the erasure of embodiment at the heart of the Turing test All that mattered was the formal generation and manipulation of informational patterns Aiding this process was a defini tion of information formalized by Claude Shannon and Norbert Wiener that conceptualized information as an entity distinct from the substrates carrying it From this formulation it was a small step to think of information as a kind of bodiless fluid that could flow between different substrates with out loss of meaning or form Writing nearly four decades after Turing Hans xi xii I Prologue Moravec proposed that human identity is essentially an informational pat tern rather than an embodied enaction The proposition can be demon strated he suggested by downloading human consciousness into a computer and he imagined a scenario designed to show that this was in principle possible The Moravec test in may call it that is the logical suc cessor to the Turing test Whereas the Turing test was designed to show that machines can perform the thinking previously considered to be an exclu sive capacity of the human mind the Moravec test was designed to show that machines can become the repository of human consciousnessthat machines can for all practical purposes become human beings You are the cyborg and the cyborg is you In the progression from Turing to Moravec the part of the Turing test that historically has been foregrounded is the distinction between thinking human and thinking machine Often forgotten is the first example Turing offered of distinguishing between a man and a woman If your failure to dis tinguish correctly between human and machine proves that machines can think what does it prove if you fail to distinguish woman from man Why does gender appear in this primal scene of humans meeting their evolu tionary successors intelligent machines What do gendered bodies have to do with the erasure of embodiment and the subsequent merging of ma chine and human intelligence in the figure of the cyborg In his thoughtful and perceptive intellectual biography of Turing Andrew Hodges suggests that Turings predilection was always to deal with the world as if it were a formal puzzle2 To a remarkable extent Hodges says Turing was blind to the distinction between saying and dOing Turing fundamentally did not understand that questions involving sex society politics or secrets would demonstrate how what it was possible for people to say might be limited not by puzzlesolving intelligence but by the restric tions on what might be done pp 42324 In a fine inSight Hodges sug gests that the discrete state machine communicating by teleprinter alone was like an ideal for Turings own life in which he would be left alone in a room of his own to deal with the outside world solely by rational argument It was the embodiment of a perfect J S Mill liberal concentrating upon the free will and free speech of the individual p 425 Turings later embroil ment with the police and court system over the question of his homosexu ality played out in a different key the assumptions embodied in the Turing test His conviction and the court ordered hormone treatments for his ho mosexuality tragically demonstrated the importance of doing over saying in the coercive order of a homophobiC society with the power to enforce its will upon the bodies of its citizens Prologue I xiii The perceptiveness of Hodgess biography notwithstanding he gives a strange interpretation of Turings inclusion of gender in the imitation game Gender according to Hodges was in fact a red herring and one of the few passages of the paper that was not expressed with perfect lucidity The whole point of this game was that a successful imitation of a womans responses by a man would not prove anything Gender depended on facts which were not reducible to sequences of symbols p 415 In the paper itself however nowhere does Turing suggest that gender is meant as a counterexample instead he makes the two cases rhetorically parallel indi cating through symmetry if nothing else that the gender and the hu manmachine examples are meant to prove the same thing Is this simply bad writing as Hodges argues an inability to express an intended opposi tion between the construction of gender and the construction of thought Or on the contrary does the writing express a parallelism too explosive and subversive for Hodges to acknowledge If so now we have two mysteries instead of one Why does Turing in clude gender and why does Hodges want to read this inclusion as indicat ing that so far as gender is concerned verbal performance cannot be equated with embodied reality One way to frame these mysteries is to see them as attempts to transgress and reinforce the boundaries of the subject respectively By including gender Turing implied that renegotiating the boundary between human and machine would involve more than trans forming the question of who can think into what can think It would also necessarily bring into question other characteristics of the liberal sub ject for it made the crucial move of distinguishing between the enacted body present in the flesh on one side of the computer screen and the rep resented body produced through the verbal and semiotic markers consti tuting it in an electronic environment This construction necessarily makes the subject into a cyborg for the enacted and represented bodies are brought into conjunction through the technology that connects them If you distinguish correctly which is the man and which the woman you in ef fect reunite the enacted and the represented bodies into a Single gender identity The very existence of the test however implies that you may also make the wrong choice Thus the test functions to create the possibility of a disjunction between the enacted and the represented bodies regardless which choice you make What the Turing test proves is that the overlay between the enacted and the represented bodies is no longer a natural in evitability but a contingent production mediated by a technology that has become so entwined with the production of identity that it can no longer meaningfully be separated from the human subject To pose the question xiv  Prologue of what can think inevitably also changes in a reverse feedback loop the terms of who can think On this view Hodgess reading of the gender test as nonsignifying with respect to identity can be seen as an attempt to safeguard the boundaries of the subject from precisely this kind of transformation to insist that the ex istence of thinking machines will not necessarily affect what being human means That Hodgess reading is a misreading indicates he is willing to prac tice violence upon the text to wrench meaning away from the direction to ward which the Turing test points back to safer ground where embodiment secures the univocality of gender I think he is wrong about embodiments securing the univocality of gender and wrong about its securing human identity but right about the importance of putting embodiment back into the picture What embodiment secures is not the distinction between male and female or between humans who can think and machines which cannot Rather embodiment makes clear that thought is a much broader cognitive function depending for its specificities on the embodied form enacting it This realization with all its exfoliating implications is so broad in its effects and so deep in its consequences that it is transforming the liberal subject regarded as the model of the human since the Enlightenment into the posthuman Think of the Turing test as a magic trick Like all good magic tricks the test relies on getting you to accept at an early stage assumptions that will de termine how you interpret what you see later The important intervention comes not when you try to determine which is the man the woman or the machine Rather the important intervention comes much earlier when the test puts you into a cybernetic circuit that splices your will desire and per ception into a distributed cognitive system in which represented bodies are joined with enacted bodies through mutating and flexible machine inter faces As you gaze at the flickering signifiers scrolling down the computer screens no matter what identifications you assign to the embodied entities that you cannot see you have already become posthuman  C b  0  p f er  Ooe TOWARD EMBODIED VIRTUALITY We need first to understand that the human formincluding human desire and all its external representationsmay be changing radically and thus must be revisioned We need to understand that five hundred years of humanism may be coming to an end as humanism transforms itself into something that we must helplessly call posthumanism Ihab Hassan Prometheus as Perfonner Towards a Posthumanist Culture This book began with a roboticists dream that struck me as a nightmare I was reading Hans Moravecs Mind Children The Future of Robot and Hu man Intelligence enjoying the ingenious variety of his robots when I hap pened upon the passage where he argues it will soon be possible to download human consciousness into a computer l To illustrate he invents a fantasy scenario in which a robot surgeon purees the human brain in a kind of cranial liposuction reading the information in each molecular layer as it is stripped away and transferring the information into a computer At the end of the operation the cranial cavity is empty and the patient now in habiting the metallic body of the computer wakens to find his conscious ness exactly the same as it was before How I asked myself was it possible for someone of Moravecs obvious intelligence to believe that mind could be separated from body Even as suming such a separation was possible how could anyone think that con sciousness in an entirely different medium would remain unchanged as if it had no connection with embodiment Shocked into awareness I began noticing he was far from alone As early as the 1950s Norbert Wiener pro posed it was theoretically possible to telegraph a human being a suggestion underlaid by the same assumptions informing Moravecs scenario2 The producers of Star Trek operate from similar premises when they imagine that the body can be dematerialized into an informational pattern and re materialized without change at a remote location Nor is the idea confined to what Beth Loffreda has called pulp science3 Much of the discourse on molecular biology treats information as the essential code the body ex presses a practice that has certain affinities with Moravecs ideas4 In fact a defining characteristic of the present cultural moment is the belief that in formation can circulate unchanged among different material substrates It is not for nothing that Beam me up Scotty has become a cultural icon for the global informational society Following this thread I was led into a maze of developments that turned into a sixyear odyssey of researching archives in the history of cybernetics interviewing scientists in computational biology and artificial life reading cultural and literary texts concerned with information technologies visit ing laboratories engaged in research on virtual reality and grappling with technical articles in cybernetics information theory autopoiesis com puter simulation and cognitive science Slowly this unruly mass of material began taking shape as three interrelated stories The first centers on how information lost its body that is how it came to be conceptualized as an en tity separate from the materialforms in which it is thought to be embedded The second story concerns how the cyborg was created as a technological artifact and cultural icon in the years follOwing World War II The third deeply implicated with the first two is the unfolding story of how a histori cally specific construction called the human is giving way to a different con struction called the posthuman Interrelations between the three stories are extensive Central to the construction of the cyborg are informational pathways connecting the or ganic body to its prosthetic extensions This presumes a conception of in formation as a disembodied entity that can flow between carbonbased organic components and siliconbased electronic components to make protein and silicon operate as a Single system When information loses its body equating humans and computers is especially easy for the materiality in which the thinking mind is instantiated appears incidental to its essential nature Moreover the idea of the feedback loop implies that the bound aries of the autonomous subject are up for grabs since feedback loops can flow not only within the subject but also between the subject and the envi ronment From Norbert Wiener on the flow of information through feed back loops has been associated with the deconstruction of the liberal humanist subject the version of the human with which I will be con cerned Although the posthuman differs in its articulations a common theme is the union of the human with the intelligent machine What is the posthuman Think of it as a point of view characterized by the follOwing assumptions I do not mean this list to be exclusive or defini tive Rather it names elements found at a variety of sites It is meant to be suggestive rather than prescriptive5 First the posthuman view privileges informational pattern over material instantiation so that embodiment in a biological substrate is seen as an accident of history rather than an in evitabilityoflife Second the posthuman view considers consciousness re Toward Embodied Virtuality I 3 garded as the seat of human identity in the Western tradition long before Descartes thought he was a mind thinking as an epiphenomenon as an evo lutionary upstart trying to claim that it is the whole show when in actuality it is only a minor sideshow Third the posthuman view thinks of the body as the original prosthesis we all learn to manipulate so that extending or re placing the body with other prostheses becomes a continuation of a process that began before we were born Fourth and most important by these and other means the posthuman view configures human being so that it can be seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines In the posthuman there are no essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily exis tence and computer simulation cybernetic mechanism and biological or ganism robot teleology and human goals To elucidate the Significant shift in underlying assumptions about sub jectivity signaled by the posthuman we can recall one of the definitive texts characterizing the liberal humanist subject C B Macphersons analysis of possessive individualism Its possessive quality is found in its conception of the individual as essentially the proprietor of his own person or capaci ties owing nothing to society for them   The human essence is freedom from the wills of others and freedom is a function of possession6 The ital icized phrases mark convenient points of departure for measuring the dis tance between the human and the posthuman Owing nothing to society comes from arguments Hobbes and Locke constructed about humans in a state of nature before market relations arose Because ownership of one self is thought to predate market relations and owe nothing to them it forms a foundation upon which those relations can be built as when one sells ones labor for wages As Macpherson points out however this imag ined state of nature is a retrospective creation of a market society The lib eral self is produced by market relations and does not in fact predate them This paradox as Macpherson calls it is resolved in the posthuman by doing away with the natural self The posthuman subject is an amalgam a collection of heterogeneous components a materialinformational entity whose boundaries undergo continuous construction and reconstruction Consider the sixmilliondollar man a paradigmatic citizen of the posthu man regime As his name implies the parts of the self are indeed owned but they are owned precisely because they were purchased not because ownership is a natural condition preexisting market relations Similarly the presumption that there is an agency desire or will belonging to the self and clearly distinguished from the wills of others is undercut in the posthu man for the posthumans collective heterogeneous quality implies a dis tributed cognition located in disparate parts that may be in only tenuous 4  Chapter One communication with one another We have only to recall Robocops mem ory flashes that interfere with his programmed directives to understand how the distributed cognition of the posthuman complicates individual agency If human essence is freedom from the wills of others the posthu man is post not because it is necessarily unfree but because there is no a priori way to identify a selfwill that can be clearly distingUished from an otherwill Although these examples foreground the cybernetic aspect of the posthuman it is important to recognize that the construction of the posthuman does not require the subject to be a literal cyborg Whether or not interventions have been made on the body new models of subjectivity emerging from such fields as cognitive science and artificial life imply that even a biologically unaltered Homo sapiens counts as posthuman The de fining characteristics involve the construction of subjectivity not the pres ence of nonbiological components What to make of this shift from the human to the posthuman which both evokes terror and excites pleasure The liberal humanist subject has of course been cogently criticized from a number of perspectives Feminist theorists have pointed out that it has historically been constructed as a white European male presuming a universality that has worked to sup press and disenfranchise womens voices postcolonial theorists have taken issue not only with the universality of the white male liberal subject but also with the very idea of a unified consistent identity fOCUSing instead on hybridity and postmodern theorists such as Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari have linked it with capitalism arguing for the liberatory potential of a dispersed subjectivity distributed among diverse desiring machines they call body without organs7 Although the deconstruction of the lib eral humanist subject in cybernetiCS has some affinities with these perspec tives it proceeded primarily along lines that sought to understand human being as a set of informational processes Because information had lost its body this construction implied that embodiment is not essential to human being Embodiment has been systematically downplayed or erased in the cybernetic construction of the posthuman in ways that have not occurred in other critiques of the liberal humanist subject espeCially in feminist and postcolonial theories Indeed one could argue that the erasure of embodiment is a feature common to both the liberal humanist subject and the cybernetic posthu man Identified with the rational mind the liberal subject possessed a body but was not usually represented as being a body Only because the body is not identified with the self is it possible to claim for the liberal subject its notorious universality a claim that depends on erasing markers of bodily Toward Embodied Virtuality  difference including sex race and ethnicity8 Gillian Brown in her influ ential study of the relation between humanism and anorexia shows that the anoretics struggle to decrement the body is possible precisely because the body is understood as an object for control and mastery rather than as an intrinsic part of the self Quoting an anoretics remarkYou make out of your body your very own kingdom where you are the tyrant the absolute dictator  Brown states Anorexia is thus a fight for selfcontrol a flight from the slavery food threatens selfsustaining selfpossession indepen dent of bodily desires is the anoretics crucial goalg In taking the selfpos session implied by liberal humanism to the extreme the anoretic creates a physical image that in its skeletal emaciation serves as material testimony that the locus of the liberal humanist subject lies in the mind not the body Although in many ways the posthuman deconstructs the liberal humanist subject it thus shares with its predecessor an emphaSiS on cognition rather than embodiment William Gibson makes the point vividly in Neuro mancer when the narrator characterizes the posthuman body as data made fleshlOTo the extent that the posthuman constructs embodiment as the instantiation of thoughtinformation it continues the liberal tradition rather than disrupts it In tracing these continuities and discontinuities between a natural self and a cybernetic posthuman I am not trying to recuperate the liberal sub ject Although I think that serious consideration needs to be given to how certain characteristics associated with the liberal subject especially agency and choice can be articulated within a posthuman context I do not mourn the passing of a concept so deeply entwined with projects of domination and oppression Rather I view the present moment as a critical juncture when interventions might be made to keep disembodiment from being rewritten once again into prevailing concepts of subjectivity I see the de construction of the liberal humanist subject as an opportunity to put back into the picture the flesh that continues to be erased in contemporary dis cussions about cybernetic subjects Hence my focus on how information lost its body for this story is central to creating what Arthur Kroker has called the flesheating 90s11 If my nightmare is a culture inhabited by posthumans who regard their bodies as fashion accessories rather than the ground of being my dream is a version of the posthuman that embraces the possibilities of information technologies without being seduced by fan tasies of unlimited power and disembodied immortality that recognizes and celebrates finitude as a condition of human being and that under stands human life is embedded in a material world of great complexity one on which we depend for our continued survival 6  Chapter One Perhaps it will now be clear that I mean my title How We Became Posthuman to connote multiple ironies which do not prevent it from also being taken seriously Taken straight this title points to models of subjec tivity sufficiently different from the liberal subject that if one assigns the term human to this subject it makes sense to call the successor posthu man Some of the historical processes leading to this transformation are documented here and in this sense the book makes good on its title Yet my argument will repeatedly demonstrate that these changes were never com plete transformations or sharp breaks without exception they reinscribed traditional ideas and assumptions even as they articulated something new The changes announced by the title thus mean something more complex than That was then this is now Rather human and posthuman coex ist in shifting configurations that vary with historically specific contexts Given these complexities the past tense in the titlebecame is in tended both to offer the reader the pleasurable shock of a double take and to reference ironically apocalyptic visions such as Moravecs prediction of a postbiological future for the human race Amplifying the ambiguities of the past tense are the ambiguities of the plural In one sense we refers to the readers of this bookreaders who by becoming aware of these new models of subjectivity if they are not al ready familiar with them may begin thinking of their actions in ways that have more in common with the posthuman than the human Speaking for myself I now find myself saying things like Well my sleep agent wants to rest but my food agent says I should go to the store Each person who thinks this way begins to envision herself or himself as a posthuman collec tivity an I transformed into the we of autonomous agents operating to gether to make a self The infectious power of this way of thinking gives we a performative dimension People become posthuman because they think they are posthuman In another sense we like became is meant ironically positioning itself in opposition to the technoecstasies found in various magazines such as Mondo 2000 which customarily speak of the transformation into the posthuman as if it were a universal human condi tion when in fact it affects only a small fraction of the worlds population a pOint to which I will return The larger trajectory of my narrative arcs from the initial moments when cybernetics was formulated as a discipline through a period of reformula tion known as secondorder cybernetics to contemporary debates swirling around an emerging discipline known as artificial life Although the progression is chronolOgical this book is not meant to be a history of cy bernetics Many figures not discussed here played important roles in that Toward Embodied Virtuality  history and I have not attempted to detail their contributions Rather my selection of theories and researchers has been dictated by a desire to show the complex interplays between embodied forms of subjectivity and argu ments for disembodiment throughout the cybernetic tradition In broad outline these interplays occurred in three distinct waves of development The first from 1945 to 1960 took homeostasis as a central concept the sec ond going roughly from 1960 to 1980 revolved around reflexivity and the third stretching from 1980 to the present highlights virtuality Let me turn now to a brief sketch of these three periods During the foundational era of cybernetics Norbert Wiener John von Neumann Claude Shannon Warren McCulloch and dozens of other distinguished researchers met at annual conferences sponsored by the JOSiah Macy Foundation to formulate the central concepts that in their high expectations would coalesce into a theory of communication and control applying equally to animals humans and machines Retrospectively called the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics these meetings held from 1943 to 1954 were instrumental in forging a new paradigm12 To succeed they needed a theory of information Shannons bailiwick a model of neural functioning that showed how neurons worked as informationprocessing systems McCullochs lifework computers that processed binary code and that could conceivably reproduce themselves thus reinforcing the analogy with biolOgical systems von Neumanns specialty and a visionary who could articulate the larger implications of the cybernetic paradigm and make clear its cosmic significance Wieners contribution The result of this breathtaking enterprise was nothing less than a new way oflooking at human beings Henceforth humans were to be seen primarily as informationpro cessing entities who are essentially similar to intelligent machines The revolutionary implications of this paradigm notwithstanding Wiener did not intend to dismantle the liberal humanist subject He was less interested in seeing humans as machines than he was in fashioning hu man and machine alike in the image of an autonomous selfdirected indi vidual In aligning cybernetiCS with liberal humanism he was following a strain of thought that since the Enlightenment had argued that human be ings could be trusted with freedom because they and the social structures they devised operated as selfregulating mechanisms 13 For Wiener cy bernetics was a means to extend liberal humanism not subvert it The point was less to show that man was a machine than to demonstrate that a ma chine could function like a man Yet the cybernetic perspective had a certain inexorable lOgiC that espe cially when fed by wartime hysteria also worked to undermine the very lib 8  Chapter One eral subjectivity that Wiener wanted to preserve These tensions were kept under control during the Macy period partly through a strong emphasis on homeostasis 14 Traditionally homeostasis had been understood as the ability ofliving organisms to maintain steady states when they are buffeted by fickle environments When the temperature soars sweat pours out of the human body so that its internal temperature can remain relatively stable During the Macy period the idea of homeostasis was extended to machines Like ani mals machines can maintain homeostasis using feedback loops Feedback loops had long been exploited to increase the stability of mechanical systems reaching a high level of development during the midtoIate nineteenth cen tury with the growing sophistication of steam engines and their accompany ing control devices such as governors It was not until the 1930s and 1940s however that the feedback loop was explicitly theorized as a flow of informa tion Cybernetics was born when nineteenthcentury control theory joined with the nascent theory of information IS Coined from the Creek word for steersman cybernetics signaled that three powerful actorsinformation control and communicationwere now operating jointly to bring about an unprecedented synthesis of the organic and the mechanical Although the informational feedback loop was initially linked with homeostasis it quickly led to the more threatening and subversive idea of reflexivity A few years ago I cotaught with a philosopher and a phYSiCist a course on reflexivity As we discussed reflexivity in the writings of Aristotle Fichte Kierkegaard Codel Turing Borges and Calvino aided by the in sightful analyses of Roger Penrose and Douglas Hofstader I was struck not only by the concepts extraordinarily rich history but also by its tendency to mutate so that virtually any formulation is sure to leave out some relevant instances Instructed by the experience I offer the follOwing tentative def inition which I hope will prove adequate for our purposes here Reflexivity is the rrwvement whereby that which has been used to generate a system is made through a changed perspective to become part of the system it gen erates When Kurt Codel invented a method of coding that allowed state ments of number theory also to function as statements about number theory he entangled that which generates the system with the system When M C Escher drew two hands drawing each other he took that which is presumed to generate the picturethe sketching handand made it part of the picture it draws When Jorge Luis Borges in The Circular Ru ins imagines a narrator who creates a student through his dreaming only to discover that he himself is being dreamed by another the system gene rat  ing a reality is shown to be part of the reality it makes As these examples il lustrate reflexivity has subversive effects because it confuses and entangles Toward Embodied Virtuality  world Reflexivity tends notoriously toward infinite regress The dreamer creates the student but the dreamer in tum is dreamed by another who in his tum is dreamed by someone else and so on to infinity This definition of reflexivity has much in common with some of the most influential and provocative recent work in critical theory cultural studies and the social studies of science Typically these works make the reflexive move of showing that an attribute previously considered to have emerged from a set of preexisting conditions is in fact used to generate the condi tions In Nancy Armstrongs Desire and Domestic Fiction A Political His tory of the Novel for example bourgeOiS femininity is shown to be constructed through the domestic fictions that represent it as already in place16 In Michael Warners The Letters of the RepubliC Publication and the Public Sphere in EighteenthCentury America the founding document of the United States the Constitution is shown to produce the very people whose existence it presupposes17 In Bruno Latours Science in Action How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society scientific experi ments are shown to produce the nature whose existence they predicate as their condition of possibility 18 It is only a slight exaggeration to say that contemporary critical theory is produced by the reflexivity that it also pro duces an observation that is of course also reflexive Reflexivity entered cybernetics primarily through discussions about the observer By and large firstwave cybernetics followed traditional scientific protocols in considering observers to be outside the system they observe Yet cybernetics also had implications that subverted this premise The objectivist view sees information flOwing from the system to the ob servers but feedback can also loop through the observers drawing them in to become part of the system being observed Although participants re marked on this aspect of the cybernetic paradigm throughout the Macy transcripts they lacked a single word to describe it To my knowledge the word reflexivity does not appear in the transcripts This meant they had no handle with which to grasp this slippery concept no Signifier that would help to constitute as well as to describe the changed perspective that reflexivity entails Discussions of the idea remained diffuse Most participants did not go beyond remarking on the shifting boundaries between observer and sys tem that cybernetics puts into play With some exceptions deeper formula tions of the problem failed to coalesce during the Macy discussions The most notable exception turned out to hurt more than it helped Lawrence Kubie a hardline Freudian psychoanalyst introduced a re flexive perspective when he argued that every utterance is doubly encoded  Chapter One acting both as a statement about the outside world and as a mirror reflecting the speakers psyche If reflexivity was already a subversive concept this in terpretation made it doubly so for it threatened to dissolve the premise of scientific objectivity shared by the physical scientists in the Macy group Their reactions to Kubies presentations show them shying away from re flexivity preferring to shift the conversation onto more comfortable ground Nevertheless the idea hung in the air and a few key thinkersespecially Margaret Mead Gregory Bateson and Heinz von Foersterresolved to pursue it after the Macy Conferences ran out of steam The second wave of cybernetics grew out of attempts to incorporate re flexivity into the cybernetic paradigm at a fundamental level The key issue was how systems are constituted as such and the key problem was how to redefine homeostatic systems so that the observer can be taken into account The second wave was initiated by among others Heinz von Foerster the Austrian emigre who became coeditor of the Macy tran scripts This phase can be dated from 1960 when von Foerster wrote the first of the essays that were later collected in his influential book Observing Systems 19 As von Foersters punning title recognizes the observer of sys tems can himself be constituted as a system to be observed Von Foerster called the models he presented in these essays secondorder cybernetics because they extended cybernetic principles to the cyberneticians them selves The second wave reached its mature phase with the publication of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varelas Autopoiesis and Cognition The Realization of the Living 20 Building on Maturanas work on reflexivity in sensory processing and Varelas on the dynamics of autonomous biologi cal systems the two authors expanded the reflexive tum into a fully articu lated epistemology that sees the world as a set of informationally closed systems Organisms respond to their environment in ways determined by their internal selforganization Their one and only goal is continually to produce and reproduce the organization that defines them as systems Hence they not only are selforganizing but also are autopoietic or self making Through Maturana and Varelas work and that of other influential theorists such as German SOCiologist Niklas Luhmann21 cybernetics by 1980 had spun off from the idea of reflexive feedback loops a theory of au topoiesis with sweeping epistemological implications In a sense autopoiesis turns the cybernetic paradigm inside out Its cen tral premisethat systems are informationally closedradically alters the idea of the informational feedback loop for the loop no longer func tions to connect a system to its environment In the autopoietic view no information crosses the boundary separating the system from its environ Toward Embodied Virtuality  I ment We do not see a world out there that exists apart from us Rather we see only what our systemic organization allows us to see The environ ment merely triggers changes determined by the systems own structural properties Thus the center of interest for autopoiesis shifts from the cy bernetics of the observed system to the cybernetics of the observer Au topoiesis also changes the explanation of what circulates through the system to make it work as a system The emphasis now is on the mutually constitutive interactions between the components of a system rather than on message signal or information Indeed one could say either that infor mation does not exist in this paradigm or that it has sunk so deeply into the system as to become indistinguishable from the organizational properties defining the system as such The third wave swelled into existence when selforganization began to be understood not merely as the reproduction of internal organization but as the springboard to emergence In the rapidly emerging field of arti ficiallife computer programs are designed to allow creatures that is dis crete packets of computer codes to evolve spontaneously in directions the programmer may not have anticipated The intent is to evolve the capacity to evolve Some researchers have argued that such selfevolving programs are not merely models oflife but are themselves alive What assumptions make this claim plausible If one sees the universe as composed essentially of information it makes sense that these creatures are life forms because they have the form oflife that is an informational code As a result the the oretical bases used to categorize all life undergo a significant shift As we shall see in chapters 9 and 10 when these theories are applied to human be ings H onw sapiens are so transfigured in conception and purpose that they can appropriately be called posthuman The emergence of the posthuman as an informationalmaterial entity is paralleled and reinforced by a corresponding reinterpretation of the deep structures of the phYSical world Some theorists notably Edward Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram claim that reality is a program run on a cosmic com puter22 In this view a universal informational code underlies the structure of matter energy spacetimeindeed of everything that exists The code is instantiated in cellular automata elementary units that can occupy two states on or off Although the jury is still out on the cellular automata model it may indeed prove to be a robust way to understand reality Even now a re search team headed by Fredkin is working on shOwing how quantum me chanics can be derived from an underlying cellular automata model What happens to the embodied lifeworld of humans in this paradigm In itself the cellular automata model is not necessarily incompatible with  Chapter One recognizing that humans are embodied beings for embodiment can flow from cellular automata as easily as from atoms No one suggests that be cause atoms are mostly empty space we can shuck the electron shells and do away with occupying space altogether Yet the cultural contexts and technological histories in which cellular automata theories are embedded encourage a comparable fantasythat because we are essentially inform a tion we can do away with the body Central to this argument is a conceptu alization that sees information and materiality as distinct entities This separation allows the construction of a hierarchy in which information is given the dominant position and materiality runs a distant second As though we had learned nothing from Derrida about supplementarity em bodiment continues to be discussed as if it were a supplement to be purged from the dominant term of information an accident of evolution we are now in a position to correct It is this materialityinformation separation that I want to contestnot the cellular automata model information theory or a host of related theo ries in themselves My strategy is to complicate the leap from embodied re ality to abstract information by pointing to moments when the assumptions involved in this move were contested by other researchers in the field and so became especially visible The point of highlighting such moments is to make clear how much had to be erased to arrive at such abstractions as bod iless information Abstraction is of course an essential component in all theOrizing for no theory can account for the infinite multiplicity of our in teractions with the real But when we make moves that erase the worlds multiplicity we risk losing Sight of the variegated leaves fractal branchings and particular bark textures that make up the forest In the pages that fol low I will identifY two moves in particular that played important roles in constructing the informationmateriality hierarchy Irreverently I think of them as the Platonic backhand and forehand The Platonic backhand works by inferring from the worlds noisy multi plicity a Simplified abstraction So far so good this is what theOrizing should do The problem comes when the move circles around to constitute the ab straction as the originary form from which the worlds multiplicity derives Then complexity appears as a fuzzing up of an essential reality rather than as a manifestation of the worlds holistic nature Whereas the platonic backhand has a history dating back to the Greeks the Platonic forehand is more recent To reach fully developed form it required the assistance of powerful comput ers This move starts from simplified abstractions and using simulation tech niques such as genetic algorithms evolves a multiplicity sufficiently complex that it can be seen as a world ofits own The two moves thus make their play in Toward Embodied Virtuality  opposite directions The backhand goes from noisy multiplicity to reductive simplicity whereas the forehand swings from simplicity to mulilicity They share a common ideologyprivileging the abstract as the Real and down playing the importance of material instantiation When they work together they lay the groundwork for a new variation on an ancient game in which dis embodied information becomes the ultimate Platonic Form If we can cap ture the Form of ones and zeros in a nonbiological mediumsay on a computer diskwhy do we need the bodys superfluous flesh Whether the enabling assumptions for this conception of information occur in information theory cybernetics or popular science books such as Mind Children their appeal is clear Information viewed as pattern and not tied to a particular instantiation is information free to travel across time and space Hackers are not the only ones who believe that information wants to be free The great dream and promise of information is that it can be free from the material constraints that govern the mortal world Marvin Minsky precisely expressed this dream when in a recent lecture he suggested it will soon be possible to extract human memories from the brain and import them intact and unchanged to computer disks23 The clear implication is that if we can become the information we have constructed we can achieve effective immortality In the face of such a powerful dream it can be a shock to remember that for information to exist it must always be instantiated in a medium whether that medium is the page from the Bell Laboratories Journal on which Shannons equations are printed the computergenerated topolOgi cal maps used by the Human Genome Project or the cathode ray tube on which virtual worlds are imaged The point is not only that abstracting in formation from a material base is an imaginary act but also and more fun damentally that conceiving of information as a thing separate from the medium instantiating it is a prior imaginary act that constructs a holistic phenomenon as an informationmatter duality24 The chapters that follow will show what had to be elided suppressed and forgotten to make information lose its body This book is a rememory in the sense of Toni Morrisons Beloved putting back together parts that have lost touch with one another and reaching out toward a complexity too unruly to fit into disembodied ones and zeros Seriation Skeuomorphs and Conceptual Constellations The foregOing leads to a strategic definition of virtuality Virtuality is the cultural perception that material objects are interpenetrated by informa tion patterns The definition plays off the duality at the heart of the condi tion of virtualitymateriality on the one hand information on the other Normally virtuality is associated with computer simulations that put the body into a feedback loop with a computergenerated image For example in virtual PingPong one swings a paddle wired into a computer which cal culates from the paddles momentum and position where the ball would go Instead of hitting a real ball the player makes the appropriate motions with the paddle and watches the image of the ball on a computer monitor Thus the game takes place partly in real life RL and partly in virtual reality VR Virtual reality technologies are fascinating because they make visually im mediate the perception that a world of information exists parallel to the real world the former intersecting the latter at many points and in many ways Hence the definitions strategic quality strategic because it seeks to connect virtual technologies with the sense pervasive in the late twentieth century that all material objects are interpenetrated by flows of informa tion from DNA code to the global reach of the World Wide Web Seeing the world as an interplay between informational patterns and material objects is a histOrically specific construction that emerged in the wake of World War II 25 By 1948 the distinction had coalesced suffiCiently for Wiener to articulate it as a criterion that any adequate theory of materi ality would be forced to meet Information is information not matter or energy No materialism which does not admit this can survive at the present day26 Wiener knew as well as anyone else that to succeed this conception of information required artifacts that could embody it and make it real When I say virtuality is a cultural perception I do not mean that it is merely a psychological phenomenon It is instantiated in an array of powerful tech nologies The perception of virtuality facilitates the development of virtual technolOgies and the technologies reinforce the perception The feedback loops that run between technologies and perceptions ar tifacts and ideas have important implications for how historical change oc curs The development of cybernetics followed neither a Kuhnian model of incommensurable paradigms nor a Foucauldian model of sharp epistemic breaks27 In the history of cybernetics ideas were rarely made up out of whole cloth Rather they were fabricated in a pattern of overlapping repli cation and innovation a pattern that I call seriation a term appropriated from archaeolOgical anthropology A brief explanation may clarifY this concept Within archaeolOgical anthropology changes in artifacts are cus tomarily mapped through seriation charts One constructs a seriation chart by parsing an artifact as a set of attributes that change over time Suppose a researcher wants to construct a seriation chart for lamps A key attribute is Toward Embodied Virtuality I the element that gives off light The first lamps dating from thousands of years ago used wicks for this element Later with the discovery of electric ity wicks gave way to filaments The figures that customarily emerge from this kind of analysis are shaped like a tigers irisnarrow at the top when an attribute first begins to be introduced with a bulge in the middle during the heyday of the attribute and tapered off at the bottom as the shift to a new model is completed On a seriation chart for lamps a line drawn at 1890 would show the figure for wicks waxing large with the figure for filaments intersected at the narrow tip of the top end Fiftyyears later the wick figure would be tapering off and the filament figure would be widening into its middle section Considered as a set the figures depicting changes in the at tributes of an artifact reveal patterns of overlapping innovation and replica tion Some attributes change from one model to the next but others remain the same As figure 1 illustrates the conceptual shifts that took place during the development of cybernetics display a seriated pattern reminiscent of mate rial changes in artifacts Conceptual fields evolve similarly to material cul ture in part because concept and artifact engage each other in continuous feedback loops An artifact materially expresses the concept it embodies but the process of its construction is far from passive A glitch has to be fixed a material exhibits unexpected properties an emergent behavior sur facesany of these challenges can give rise to a new concept which results in another generation of artifact which leads to the development of still other concepts The reasoning suggests that we should be able to trace the development of a conceptual field by using a seriation chart analogous to the seriation charts used for artifacts In the course of the Macy Conferences certain ideas came to be associ ated with each other Through a cumulative process that continued across several years of discussions these ideas were seen as mutually entailing each other until like love and marriage they were viewed by the partici pants as naturally going together Such a constellation is the conceptual en tity corresponding to an artifact possessing an internal coherence that defines it as an operational unit Its formation marks the beginning of a pe riod its disassembly and reconstruction Signal the transition to a different period Indeed periods are recognizable as such largely because constel lations possess this coherence Rarely is a constellation discarded whole sale Rather some of the ideas composing it are discarded others are modified and new ones are introduced Like the attributes composing an artifact the ideas in a constellation change in a patchwork pattern of old and new Period Self Organization signalnoise circular causality instrumental language Constellations Reflexivity Virtuality FIGURE 1 The three waves of cybernetics Artifacts electronic rat homeostat electric tortoise frogs visual cortex simulation mobile robot Skeuomorphs mallillthemiddle homeostasis selforgallizatioll Toward Embodied Virtuality  Here I want to introduce another term from archaeological anthropol ogy A skeuonwryh is a design feature that is no longer functional in itself but that refers back to a feature that was functional at an earlier time The dashboard of my Toyota Camry for example is covered by vinyl molded to simulate stitching The simulated stitching alludes back to a fabric that was in fact stitched although the vinyl stitching is formed by an injection mold Skeuomorphs visibly testify to the social or psychological necessity for innovation to be tempered by replication Like anachronisms their pe jorative first cousins skeuomorphs are not unusual On the contrary they are so deeply characteristic of the evolution of concepts and artifacts that it takes a great deal of conscious effort to avoid them At SIGGRAPH the annual computer trade show where dealers come to hawk their wares hard and soft there are almost as many skeuomorphs as morphs The complex psychological functions a skeuomorph performs can be illustrated by an installation exhibited at SIGGRAPH 93 Called the Catholic Turing Test the simulation invited the viewer to make a confes sion by chOOSing selections from the video screen it even had a bench on which the viewer could kneel 28 On one level the installation alluded to the triumph of science over religion for the role of divinely authorized interro gation and absolution had been taken over by a machine algorithm On an other level the installation pointed to the intransigence of conditioned behavior for the machines form and function were determined by its reli gious predecessor Like a Janus figure the skeuomorph looks to past and future Simultaneously reinforcing and undermining both It calls into a playa psychodynamic that finds the new more acceptable when it recalls the old that it is in the process of displacing and finds the traditional more comfortable when it is presented in a context that reminds us we can escape from it into the new In the history of cybernetics skeuomorphs acted as threshold devices smoothing the transition between one conceptual constellation and an other Homeostasis a foundational concept during the first wave func tioned during the second wave as a skeuomotph Although homeostasis remained an important concept in biology by about 1960 it had ceased to be an initiating premise in cybernetics Instead it performed the work of a gesture or an allusion used to authenticate new elements in the emerging constellation of reflexivity At the same time it also exerted an inertial pull on the new elements limiting how radically they could transform the con stellation A similar phenomenon appears in the transition from the second to the third wave Reflexivity the key concept of the second wave is displaced in the third wave by emergence Like homeostasis reRexivity does not alto gether disappear but lingers on as an allusion that authenticates new ele ments It performs a more complex role than mere nostalgia however for it also leaves its imprint on the new constellation of virtuality The complex story formed by these seriated changes is told in chapters 3 6 and 9 which discuss cybernetics autopoiesis and artificial life respectively I have already suggested that living in a condition of virtuality implies we participate in the cultural perception that information and materiality are conceptually distinct and that information is in some sense more essential more important and more fundamental than materiality The preamble to A Magna Carta for the Knowledge Age a document coauthored by Alvin TofHer at the behest of Newt Gingrich concisely sums up the matter by proclaiming The central event of the 20th century is the overthrow of matter29 To see how this view began to acquire momentum let us brieRy Rash back to 1948 when Claude Shannon a brilliant theorist working at Bell Laboratories defined a mathematical quantity he called information and proved several important theorems concerning it3o Information Theory and Everyday Life Shannons theory defines information as a probability function with no di mensions no materiality and no necessary connection with meaning It is a pattern not a presence Chapter 3 talks about the development of infor mation theory in more detail and the relevant equations can be found there The theory makes a strong distinction between message and signal Lacan to the contrary a message does not always arrive at its destination In information theoretic terms no message is ever sent What is sent is a sig nal Only when the message is encoded in a Signal for transmission through a mediumfor example when ink is printed on paper or when electrical pulses are sent racing along telegraph wiresdoes it assume material form The very definition of information then encodes the distinction between materiality and information that was also becoming important in molecular biology during this period31 Why did Shannon define information as a pattern The transcripts of the Macy Conferences indicate that the choice was driven by the twin engines of reliable quantification and theoretical generality As we shall see in chap ter 3 Shannons formulation was not the only proposal on the table Donald MacKay a British researcher argued for an alternative definition that linked information with change in a receivers mindset and thus with meaning32 To be workable MacKays definition required that psychologi Toward Embodied Virtuality  cal states be quantifiable and measurablean accomplishment that only now appears distantly possible with such imaging technologies as positron emission tomography and that certainly was not in reach in the immediate postWorld War II years It is no mystery why Shannons definition rather than MacKays became the industry standard Shannons approach had other advantages that turned out to incur large and mounting costs when his premise interacted with certain predisposi tions already at work within the culture Abstracting information from a material base meant that information could become freefloating unaf fected by changes in context The technical leverage this move gained was considerable for by formalizing information into a mathematical function Shannon was able to develop theorems powerful in their generality that hold true regardless of the medium in which the information is instanti ated Not everyone agreed this move was a good idea however despite its theoretical power As Carolyn Marvin  Chapter One such as Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and Bell Laboratories most ma jor research universities and hundreds of corporations have so thoroughly incorporated virtual technologies into their infrastructures that informa tion is as much as part of the researchers mindscapes as is electric lighting or synthetic plastics35 The thirty million Americans who are plugged into the Internet increasingly engage in virtual experiences enacting a division between the material body that exits on one side of the screen and the com puter simulacra that seem to create a space inside the screen36 Yet for mil lions more virtuality is not even a cloud on the horizon of their everyday worlds Within a global context the experience of virtuality becomes more exotic by several orders of magnitude It is a useful corrective to remember that 70 percent of the worlds population has never made a telephone call Nevertheless I think it is a mistake to underestimate the importance of virtuality for it wields an influence altogether disproportionate to the num ber of people immersed in it It is no accident that the condition of virtual ity is most pervasive and advanced where the centers of power are most concentrated Theorists at the Pentagon for example see it as the theater in which future wars will be fought They argue that coming conflicts will be decided not so much by overwhelming force as by neocortical warfare waged through the technosciences of information 37 If we want to contest what these technologies SignifY we need histories that show the erasures that went into creating the condition of virtuality as well as visions arguing for the importance of embodiment Once we understand the complex in terplays that went into creating the condition of virtuality we can demystifY our progress toward virtuality and see it as the result of historically specific negotiations rather than of the irresistible force of technological determin ism At the same time we can acquire resources with which to rethink the assumptions underlying virtuality and we can recover a sense of the virtual that fully recognizes the importance of the embodied processes constitut ing the lifeworld of human beings38 In the phrase virtual bodies I intend to allude to the historical separation between information and materiality and also to recall the embodied processes that resist this division Virtuality and Contemporary Literature I have already suggested that one way to think about the organization of this book is chronologically since it follows the three waves of seriated changes in cybernetics In this organization of the textual body each of the three chronologically arranged divisions has an anchOring chapter discussing the scientific theories on the Macy Conferences chapter 3 on autopoiesis Toward Embodied Virtuality   chapter 6 and on artificial life chapter 9 respectively Each section also has a chapter showing specific applications of the theories the work of Norbert Wiener chapter 4 taperecording technologies chapter 8 and humancomputer interactions chapter 10 Also included in each of the three divisions are chapters on literary texts contemporaneous with the development of the scientific theories and cybernetic technolOgies chap ters 57 and 10 I have selected literary texts that were clearly influenced by the development of cybernetics Nevertheless I want to resist the idea that influence flows from science into literature The crosscurrents are conSiderably more complex than a oneway model of influence would al low In the Neuromancer trilogy for example William Gibsons vision of cyberspace had a considerable effect on the development of threedim en sional virtual reality imaging software 39 A second way to think about the organization of How We Became Posthuman is narratively In this arrangement the three divisions proceed not so much through chronolOgical progression as through the narrative strands about the lost body of information the cyborg body and the posthuman body Here the literary texts playa central role for they display the passageways that enabled stories coming out of narrowly focused scien tific theories to circulate more widely through the body politic Many of the scientists understood very well that their negotiations involved premises broader than the formal scope of their theories strictly allowed Because of the wedge that has been driven between science and values in US culture their statements on these wider implications necessarily occupied the posi tion of ad hoc pronouncements rather than scientific arguments Shaped by different conventions the literary texts range across a spectrum ofissues that the scientific texts only fitfully illuminate including the ethical and cul tural implications of cybernetiC technologies4o Literary texts are not of course merely passive conduits They actively shape what the technolOgies mean and what the scientific theories signify in cultural contexts They also embody assumptions similar to those that permeated the scientific theories at critical points These assumptions in cluded the idea that stability is a desirable social goal that human beings and human social organizations are selforganizing structures and that form is more essential than matter The scientific theories used these as sumptions as enabling presuppositions that helped to gUide inquiry and shape research agendas As the chapters on the scientific developments will show culture circulates through science no less than science circulates through culture The heart that keeps this circulatory system flOwing is narrativenarratives about culture narratives within culture narratives 22  Chapter One about science narratives within science In my account of the scientific de velopments I have sought to emphasize the role that narrative plays in articulating the posthuman as a technicalcultural concept For example chapter 4 on Wieners scientific work is interlaced with analyses of the nar ratives he tells to resolve conflicts between cybernetics and liberal human ism and chapter 9 on artificial life is organized by looking at this area of research as a narrative field What does this emphasis on narrative have to do with virtual bodies FollOwing J eanFrancois Lyotard many theorists of postmodernity accept that the postmodern condition implies an incredulity toward metanarra tive41 As we have seen one way to construct virtuality is the way that Moravec and Minsky doas a metanarrative about the transformation of the human into a disembodied posthuman I think we should be skeptical about this metanarrative To contest it I want to use the resources of narra tive itself particularly its resistance to various forms of abstraction and dis embodiment With its chronolOgical thrust polymorphous digreSSions located actions and personified agents narrative is a more embodied form of discourse than is analytically driven systems theory By turning the tech nolOgical determinism of bodiless information the cyborg and the post human into narratives about the negotiations that took place between particular people at particular times and places I hope to replace a teleol ogy of disembodiment with historically contingent stories about contests between competing factions contests whose outcomes were far from obvi ous Many factors affected the outcomes from the needs of emerging tech nologies for reliable quantification to the personalities of the people involved Though overdetermined the disembodiment ofinformation was not inevitable any more than it is inevitable we continue to accept the idea that we are essentially informational patterns In this regard the literary texts do more than explore the cultural impli cations of scientific theories and technolOgical artifacts Embedding ideas and artifacts in the situated specificities of narrative the literary texts give these ideas and artifacts a local habitation and a name through discursive formulations whose effects are specific to that textual body In explOring these effects I want to demonstrate on multiple levels and in many ways that abstract pattern can never fully capture the embodied actuality unless it is as prolix and noisy as the body itself Shifting the emphaSiS from tech nolOgical determinism to competing contingent embodied narratives about the scientific developments is one way to liberate the resources of narrative so that they work against the grain of abstraction running through the teleology of disembodiment Another way is to read literary texts along Toward Embodied Virtuality I side scientific theories In articulating the connections that run through these two discursive realms I want to entangle abstract form and material particularity such that the reader will find it increaSingly difficult to main tain the perception that they are separate and discrete entities If for cul tural and historical reasons I cannot start from a holistic perspective I hope to mix things up enough so that the emphasis falls not on the separa tion of matter and information but on their inextricably complex com poundings and entwinings For this project the literary texts with their fashionings of embodied particularities are crucial The first literary text I discuss in detail is Bernard Wolfes Limbo 42 Writ ten in the 1950s Limbo has become something of an underground classic It imagines a postwar society in which an ideology Immob has developed the ideology equates aggression with the ability to move Pacifism equals passivity Immob slogans declare True believers volunteer to banish their mobility and presumably their aggreSSion by having amputations which have come to be regarded as signifiers of social power and influence These amputees get bored with lying around however so a vigorous cyberneticS industry has grown up to replace their missing limbs As this brief summary suggests Limbo is deeply influenced by cybernetiCS But the technical achievements of cybernetics are not at the center of the text Rather they serve as a springboard to explore a variety of social political and psycho logical issues ranging from the perceived threat that womens active sexu ality poses for Immob men to global EastWest tensions that explode into another world war at the end of the text Although it is unusually didactic Limbo does more than discuss cyberneticS it engages a full range of rhetor ical and narrative devices that work both with and against its explicit pro nouncements The narrator seems only partially able to control his verbally extravagant narrative There are I will argue deep connections between the narrators struggle to maintain control of the narrative and the threat to natural body boundaries posed by the cybernetiC paradigm Limbo in terrogates a dynamiC that also appears in Norbert Wieners workthe in tense anxiety that erupts when the perceived boundaries of the body are breached In addition it illustrates how the body of the text gets implicated in the processes used to represent bodies within the text Several Philip K Dick novels written from 1962 to 1966 including We Can Build You Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Dr Blood rooney and Ubik provide another set of texts through which the multiple implications of the posthuman can be explored43 Chronologically and the matically Dicks novels of simulation cross the scientific theory of au topoiesis Like Maturana Varela and other scientific researchers in the second wave of cybernetics Dick is intensely concerned with epistemolog ical questions and their relation to the cybernetic paradigm The problem of where to locate the observerin or out of the system being observed is conflated in his fiction with how to determine whether a creature is an droid or human For Dick the android is deeply bound up with the gender politics of his male protagonists relations with female characters who am biguously figure either as sympathetic lifegiving darkhaired girls or emotionally cold lifethreatening schizoid women Already fascinated with epistemological questions that reveal how shaky our constructions of reality can be Dick is drawn to cybernetic themes because he understands that cybernetics radically destabilizes the ontolOgical foundations of what counts as human The gender politics he writes into his novels illustrate the potent connections between cybernetics and contemporary understand ings of race gender and sexuality The chapter on contemporary speculative fictions constructs a semiotics of virtuality by shOwing how the central concepts ofinformation and materi ality can be mapped onto a multilayered semiotic square The tutor texts for this analYSis which include Snow Crash Blood Music Galatea 22 and Ter minal Games indicate the range of what counts as the posthuman in the age of virtuality from neural nets to hackers biolOgically modified humans and entities who live only in computer simulations44 In follOwing the construc tion of the posthuman in these texts I will argue that older ideas are rein scribed as well as contested As was the case for the scientific models change occurs in a seriated pattern of overlapping innovation and replication I hope that this book will demonstrate once again how crucial it is to recognize interrelations between different kinds of cultural productions specifically literature and science The stories I tell herehow informa tion lost its body how the cyborg was created as a cultural icon and techno lOgical artifact and how humans became posthumansand the waves of historical change I chart would not have the same resonance or breadth if they had been pursued only through literary texts or only through scientific discourses The scientific texts often reveal as literature cannot the foun dational assumptions that gave theoretical scope and artifactual efficacy to a particular approach The literary texts often reveal as scientific work can not the complex cultural social and representational issues tied up with conceptual shifts and technological innovations From my point of view lit erature and science as an area of specialization is more than a subset of cul tural studies or a minor activity in a literature department It is a way of understanding ourselves as embodied creatures living within and through embodied worlds and embodied words  ChQpreL  Two VIRTUAL BODIES AND FLICKERING SIGNIFIERS We might regard patterning or predictability as the very essence and raison d etre of communication   communication is the creation of redundancy orpatteming Gregory Bateson Steps to an Ecology of Mind The development of information theory in the wake of World War II left as its legacy a conundrum even though information provides the basis for much of contemporary US society it has been constructed never to be present in itself In information theoretic terms as we saw in chapter 1 information is conceptually distinct from the markers that embody it for example newsprint or electromagnetic waves It is a pattern rather than a presence defined by the probability distribution of the coding elements composing the message If information is pattern then noninformation should be the absence of pattern that is randomness This commonsense expectation ran into unexpected complications when certain devel opments within information theory implied that information could be equated with randomness as well as with pattern 1 Identifying information with both pattern and randomness proved to be a powerful paradox lead ing to the realization that in some instances an infusion of noise into a sys tem can cause it to reorganize at a higher level of complexity 2 Within such a system pattern and randomness are bound together in a complex dialec tic that makes them not so much opposites as complements or supplements to one another Each helps to define the other each contributes to the flow of information through the system Were this dialectical relation only an aspect of the formal theory its im pact might well be limited to the problems of maximizing channel utility and minimizing noise that concern electrical engineers Through the de velopment of information technologies however the interplay between pattern and randomness became a feature of everyday life As Friedrich Kittler has demonstrated in Discourse Networks 180011900 media come into existence when technologies of inscription intervene between the hand gripping the pen or the mouth framing the sounds and the production of the texts In a literal sense technologies of inscription are media when they are perceived as mediating inserting themselves into the chain oftex tual production Kittleridentifies the innovative characteristics of the type writer originally designed for the blind not with speed but rather with spatially designated and discrete signs along with a corresponding shift from the word as HOwing image to the word as a geometrical figure created by the spatial arrangements of the letter keys here Kittler quotes Richard Herbertz3 The emphasis on spatially fixed and geometrically arranged letters is significant fOritpoints to the physicality of the processes involved Typewriter keys are directly proportionate to the script they produce One keystroke yields one letter and striking the key harder produces a darker letter The system lends itself to a signification model that links Signifier to Signified in direct correspondence for there is a onetoone relation be tween the key and the letter it produces Moreover the Signifier itself is spatially discrete durably inscribed and Hat How does this experience change with electronic media The relation between striking a key and producing text with a computer is very different from the relation achieved with a typewriter Display brightness is unre lated to keystroke pressure and striking a Single key can effect massive changes in the entire text The computer restores and heightens the sense of word as imagean image drawn in a medium as Huid and changeable as water4 Interacting with electronic images rather than with a materially re sistant text I absorb through my fingers as well as my mind a model of sig nification in which no simple onetoone correspondence exists between signifier and Signified I know kinesthetically as well as conceptually that the text can be manipulated in ways that would be impossible if it existed as a material object rather than a visual display As I work with the textas Hickeringimage I instantiate within my body the habitual patterns of movement that make pattern and randomness more real more relevant and more powerful than presence and absence The technolOgies of virtual reality with their potential for fullbody me diation further illustrate the kind of phenomena that foreground pattern and randomness and make presence and absence seem irrelevant Already an industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars virtual reality puts the users sensory system into a direct feedback loop with a computer5 In one version the user wears a stereovision helmet and a body glove with sensors at joint positions The users movements are reproduced by a simulacrum called an avatar on the computer screen When the user turns his or her head the computer display changes in a corresponding fashion At the same time audiophones create a threedimensional sound field Kines Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier I thetic sensations such as GIoads for flight simulators can be supplied through more extensive and elaborate body coverings The result is a mul tisensory interaction that creates the illusion that the user is inside the com puter From my experience with the virtual reality simulations at the Human Interface Technology Laboratory and elsewhere I can attest to the disorienting exhilarating effect of the feeling that subjectivity is dispersed throughout the cybernetic circuit In these systems the user learns kines thetically and proprioceptively that the relevant boundaries for interaction are defined less by the skin than by the feedback loops connecting body and simulation in a technobiointegrated circuit Questions about presence and absence do not yield much leverage in this situation for the avatar both is and is not present just as the user both is and is not inside the screen Instead the focus shifts to questions about pattern and randomness What transformations govern the connections between user and avatar What parameters control the construction of the screen world What patterns can the user discover through interaction with the system Where do these patterns fade into randomness What stimuli cannot be encoded within the system and therefore exist only as ex traneous noise When and how does this noise coalesce into pattern Working from a different theoretical framework Allucquere Roseanne Stone has proposed that one need not enter virtual reality to encounter these questions although VR brings them vividly into the foreground Merely communicating by email or participating in a textbased MUD multiuser dungeon already problematizes thinking of the body as a self evident physicality6 In the face of such technologies Stone proposes that we think of subjectivity as a multiple warranted by the body rather than contained within it Sherry Turkle in her faSCinating work on people who spend serious time in MUDs convincingly shows that virtual technologies in a riptide of reverse influence affect how real life is seen Reality is not my best window one of her respondents remarks 7 In societies enmeshed within information networks as the US and other first world societies are these examples can be multiplied a thou sandfold Money is increasingly experienced as informational patterns stored in computer banks rather than as the presence of cash surrogacy and in vitro fertilization court cases offer examples of informational genetic patterns competing with physical presence for the right to determine the legitimate parent automated factories are controlled by programs that constitute the physical realities of work assignments and production sched ules as flows of information through the system8 criminals are tied to crime scenes through DNA patterns rather than through eyewitness accounts 28  Chapter Two verifYing their presence access to computer networks rather than physical possession of data determines ninetenths of computer law9 sexual rela tionships are pursued through the virtual spaces of computer networks rather than through meetings at which the participants are physically pre sent 10 The effect of these transformations is to create a highly heteroge neous and fissured space in which discursive formations based on pattern and randomness jostle and compete with formations based on presence and absence Given the long tradition of dominance that presence and ab sence have enjoyed in the Western tradition the surprise is not that forma tions based on them continue to exist but that these formations are being displaced so rapidly across a wide range of cultural sites These examples taken from studies of information technologies illus trate concerns that are also appropriate for literary texts If the effects that the shift toward patternrandomness has on literature are not widely rec ognized perhaps it is because they are at once pervasive and elusive A book produced by typesetting may look very similar to one generated by a computerized program but the technological processes involved in this transformation are not neutral Different technologies of text production suggest different models of signification changes in signification are linked with shifts in consumption shifting patterns of consumption initiate new experiences of embodiment and embodied experience interacts with codes of representation to generate new kinds of textual worlds 11 In fact each categoryproduction signification consumption bodily experi ence and representationis in constant feedback and feedforward loops with the others As the emphasis shifts to pattern and randomness characteristics of print texts that used to be transparent because they were so pervasive are becoming visible again through their differences from digital textuality We lose the opportunity to understand the implications of these shifts if we mistake the dominance of patternrandomness for the disappearance of the material world In fact it is precisely because material interfaces have changed that pattern and randomness can be perceived as dominant over presence and absence The patternrandomness dialectic does not erase the material world information in fact derives its efficacy from the mater ial infrastructures it appears to obscure This illusion of erasure should be the subject of inquiry not a presupposition that inquiry takes for granted To explore the importance of the mediums materiality let us consider the book Like the human body the book is a form ofinformation transmis sion and storage and like the human body the book incorporates its en codings in a durable material substrate Once encoding in the material base Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  has taken place it cannot easily be changed Print and proteins in this sense have more in common with each other than with magnetic encodings which can be erased and rewritten simply by changing the polarities In chapter 8 we shall have an opportunity to see how a books selfrepresenta tions change when the book is linked with magnetic encodings The print ing metaphors pervasive in the discourse of genetics are constituted through and by this similarity of corporeal encoding in books and bodies The entanglement of signal and materiality in bodies and books confers on them a parallel doubleness As we have seen the human body is under stood in molecular biology simultaneously as an expression of genetic in formation and as a physical structure Similarly the literary corpus is at once a physical object and a space of representation a body and a message Because they have bodies books and humans have something to lose if they are regarded solely as informational patterns namely the resistant materi ality that has traditionally marked the durable inscription of books no less than it has marked our experiences ofliving as embodied creatures From this affinity emerge complex feedback loops between contemporary litera ture the technologies that produce it and the embodied readers who pro duce and are produced by books and technologies Changes in bodies as they are represented within literary texts have deep connections with changes in textual bodies as they are encoded within information media and both types of changes stand in complex relation to changes in the construction of human bodies as they interface with information technolo gies The term I use to deSignate this network of relations is informatics Following Donna Haraway I take informatics to mean the technologies of information as well as the biological social linguistic and cultural changes that initiate accompany and complicate their development 12 I am now in a position to state the thesis of this chapter explicitly The contemporary pressure toward dematerialization understood as an epis temic shift toward patternrandomness and away from presenceabsence affects human and textual bodies on two levels at once as a change in the body the material substrate and as a change in the message the codes of representation The connectivity between these changes is as they say in the computer industry maSSively parallel and highly interdigitated My narrative will therefore weave back and forth between the represented worlds of contemporary fictions models of signification implicit in word processing embodied experience as it is constructed by interactions with information technologies and the technologies themselves The compounding of Signal with materiality suggests that new technolo gies will instantiate new models of signification Information technologies do more than change modes of text production storage and dissemination They fundamentally alter the relation of Signified to Signifier Carrying the instabilities implicit in Lacanian floating signifiers one step further infor mation technologies create what I will calljlickering signifiers character ized by their tendency toward unexpected metamorphoses attenuations and dispersions Flickering signifiers signal an important shift in the plate tectonics oflanguage Much of contemporary fiction is directly influenced by information technolOgies cyberpunk for example takes informatics as its central theme Even narratives without this focus can hardly avoid the rippling effects of informatics however for the changing modes of signifi cation affect the codes as well as the subjects of representation Signifying the Processes of Production Language is not a code Lacan asserted because he wanted to deny one toone correspondence between the Signifier and the signified13 In word processing however language is a code The relation between machine and compiler languages is specified by a coding arrangement as is the rela tion of the compiler language to the programming commands that the user manipulates Through these multiple transformations some quantity is conserved but it is not the mechanical energy implicit in a system oflevers or the molecular energy of a thermodynamical system Rather it is the in formational structure that emerges from the interplay between pattern and randomness When a text presents itself as a constantly refreshed im age rather than as a durable inscription transformations can occur that would be unthinkable if matter or energy rather than informational pat terns formed the primary basis for the systemic exchanges This textual flu idity which users learn in their bodies as they interact with the system implies that signifiers flicker rather than float To explain what I mean by flickering signifiers I will briefly review Lacans notion of floating signifiers Lacan operating within a view oflan guage that was primarily printbased rather than electronically mediated not surprisingly focused on presence and absence as the dialectic of inter est14 When he formulated the concept of floating signifiers he drew on Saussures idea that signifiers are defined by networks of relational differ ences between themselves rather than by their relation to signifieds He complicated this picture by maintaining that signifieds do not exist in them selves except insofar as they are produced by signifiers He imagined them as an ungraspable flow floating beneath a network of signifiers a network that itself is constituted through continual slippages and displacements Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  3 Thus for him a doubly reinforced absence is at the core of signification the absence of signifieds as thingsinthemselves as well as the absence of stable correspondences between signifiers The catastrophe in psycholin guistic development corresponding to this absence in signification is cas tration the moment when the male subject symbolically confronts the realization that subjectivity like language is founded on absence How does this scenario change when floating signifiers give way to flick ering signifiers Foregrounding pattern and randomness information technologies operate within a realm in which the signifier is opened to a rich internal play of difference In informatics the signifier can no longer be understood as a single marker for example an ink mark on a page Rather it exists as a flexible chain of markers bound together by the arbitrary rela tions specified by the relevant codes As I write these words on my com puter I see the lights on the video screen but for the computer the relevant signifiers are electronic polarities on disks Intervening between what I see and what the computer reads are the machine code that correlates al phanumeric symbols with binary digits the compiler language that corre lates these symbols with higherlevel instmctions determining how the symbols are to be manipulated the processing program that mediates be tween these instmctions and the commands I give the computer and so forth A signifier on one level becomes a signified on the nexthigher level PreCisely because the relation between signifier and signified at each of these levels is arbitrary it can be changed with a single global command If I am prodUCing ink marks by manipulating movable type changing the font requires changing each line of type By contrast if I am prodUCing flicker ing signifiers on a video screen changing the font is as easy as giving the sys tem a single command The longer the chain of codes the more radical the transformations that can be effected Acting as linguistic transducers the coding chains impart astonishing power to even very small changes Such amplification is possible because the constant reproduced through multi ple coding layers is a pattern rather than a presence Where does randomness enter this picture Within information theory information is identified with choices that reduce uncertainty for example when I choose which book out of eight on a reading list my seminar will read for the first week of class To get this information to the students I need some way to transmit it Information theory treats the communica tion situation as a system in which a sender encodes a message and sends it as a signal through a channel At the other end is a receiver who decodes the Signal and reconstitutes the message Suppose I write my students an email The computer encodes the message in binary digits and sends a sig nal corresponding to these digits to the server which then reconstitutes the message in a form the students can read At many points along this route noise can intervene The message may be garbled by the computer system so that it arrives looking like e 1 s   Or I may have gotten distracted thinking about DeLillo halfWay through the message so that although I meant to assign Calvino for the first week the message comes out If on a winters night a white noise These examples indicate that for reallife communication situations pattern exists in dynamic tension with the ran dom intrusions of noise Uncertainty enters in another sense as well Although information is often defined as reducing uncertainty it also depends on uncertainty Sup pose for example Gravitys Rainbow is the only text on the reading list The probability that I would choose it is 1 If I send an email telling my students that the text for this week is Gravitys Rainbow they willleam nothing they did not already know and no information is communicated The most surprising information I could send them would be a string of random letters Remember that information in the technical sense has nothing to do with meaning the fact that such a message would be mean ingless is thus paradoxically irrelevant to calculating the amount of infor mation it contains These intuitions are confirmed by the mathematical theory of information15 For an individual message the information increases as the probability that the event will occur diminishes the more unlikely the event the more information it conveys Appropriately this quantity is usually called the surprisal Lets say that nine of my reading assignments were on Gravitys Rainbow and one was on Vineland The students would gain more information from a message telling them that the assignment was Vineland than from a message stating that the assignment was Gravitys Rainbowthe more probable event and hence the more ex pected Most of the time however electrical engineers are not interested in individual messages but in all the messages that can be produced from a given source Thus they do not so much want to know the surprisal as the average amount of information coming from a source This average reaches a maximum when it is equally likely that any symbol can appear in any positionwhich is to say when there is no pattern or when the mes sage is at the extreme of randomness Thus Warren Weaver in his interpre tation of Shannons theory of information suggested that information should be understood as depending on both predictability and unpre dictability pattern and randomness16 What happens in the case of mutation Consider the example of the ge netic code Mutation normally occurs when some random event for exam ple a burst of radiation or a coding error disrupts an existing pattern and Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  something else is put in its place instead Although mutation disrupts pat tern it also presupposes a morphological standard against which it can be measured and understood as a mutation If there were only randomness as with the random movements of gas molecules it would make no sense to speak of mutation We have seen that in electronic textuality the possi bilities for mutation within the text are enhanced and heightened by long coding chains We can now understand mutation in more fundamental terms Mutation is crucial because it names the bifurcation point at which the interplay between pattern and randomness causes the system to evolve in a new direction It reveals the productive potential of randomness that is also recognized within information theory when uncertainty is seen as both antagonistic and intrinsic to information We are now in a position to understand mutation as a decisive event in the psycholinguistics of information Mutation is the catastrophe in the patternrandomness dialectic analogous to castration in the presenceab sence dialectic It marks a rupture of pattern so extreme that the expecta tion of continuous replication can no longer be sustained But as with castration this only appears to be a disruption located at a specific moment The randomness to which mutation testifies is implicit in the very idea of pattern for only against the background of nonpattern can pattern emerge Randomness is the contrasting term that allows pattern to be understood as such The crisis named by mutation is as wideranging and pervasive in its import within the patternrandomness dialectic as castration is within the tradition of presenceabsence for it is the visible mark that testifies to the continuing interplay of the dialectic between pattern and randomness replication and variation expectation and surprise Shifting the emphasis from presenceabsence to patternrandomness suggests different choices for tutor texts Rather than studying Freuds dis cussion of fort da a short passage whose replication in hundreds of com mentaries would no doubt astonish its creator theorists interested in pattern and randomness might point to David Cronenbergs film The Fly At a certain point the protagonists penis does falloff quaintly he puts it in his medicine chest as a memento of times past but the loss scarcely regis ters in the larger mutation he is undergoing The operative transition is not from male to femaleascastratedmale but from human to something rad ically other than human Flickering signification brings together language with a psychodynamics based on the symbolic moment when the human confronts the posthuman As I indicated in chapter 1 I understand human and posthuman to be histOrically specific constructions that emerge from different configura tions of embodiment technology and culture My reference point for the human is the tradition ofliberal humanism the posthuman appears when computation rather than possessive individualism is taken as the ground of being a move that allows the posthuman to be seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines To see how technology interacts with these construc tions consider the picture that nineteenthcentury VS and British an thropologists have drawn of man as a tooluser 17 V sing tools may shape the body some anthropolOgists made this argument but the tool never theless is envisioned as an object that is apart from the body an object that can be picked up and put down at will When the claim that mans unique nature was defined by tool use could not be sustained because other ani mals were shown also to use tools the focus shifted during the early twen tieth century to man the toolmaker Typical is Kenneth P Oakleys 1949 Man the ToolMaker a magisterial work with the authOrity of the British Museum behind it Oakley in charge of the Anthropological Section of the museums Natural History Division wrote in his introduction Employ ment of tools appears to be mans chief biological characteristic for con sidered functionally they are detachable extensions of the forelimb 18 The kind of tool he envisioned was mechanical rather than informational it goes with the hand not on the head Significantly he imagined the tool to be at once detachable and an extension separate from yet partaking of the hand If the placement and the kind of tool mark Oakleys affinity with the epoch of the human the construction of the tool as a prosthesis points forward to the posthuman By the 1960s Marshall McLuhan was speculating about the transforma tion that media understood as technological prostheses were effecting on human beings19 He argued that humans react to stress in their envi ronments by withdrawing the locus of selfhood inward in a numbing withdrawal from the world he called follOwing Hans Selye and Adolphe Jonas autoamputation This withdrawal in tum facilitates and requires compensating technological extensions that project the bodyasprosthesis back out into the world Whereas Oakley remains grounded in the human and looks only distantly toward the posthuman McLuhan clearly sees that electronic media are capable of bringing about a reconfiguration so exten sive as to change the nature of man As we saw in chapter 1 similar shifts in orientation informed the Macy Conference discussions taking place during the same period 194653 Participants wavered between a vision of man as a homeostatic self regulating mechanism whose boundaries were clearly delineated from the environment20 and a more threatening reflexive vision of a man spliced into an informational circuit that could change him in unpredictable ways Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier I 35 By the 1960s the consensus within cybernetics had shifted dramatically to ward reflexivity By the 1980s the inertial pull of homeostasis as a constitu tive concept had largely given way to selforganization theories implying that radical changes were possible within certain kinds of complex sys tems21 In the contemporary period the posthuman future of humanity is increaSingly evoked ranging from Hans Moravecs argument for a postbi ological future in which intelligent machines become the dominant life form on the planet to the more sedate and in part already realized prospect of a symbiotic union between human and intelligent machine a union that Howard Rheingold calls intelligence augmentation22 Although these vi sions differ in the degree and kind of interfaces they imagine they concur that the posthuman implies not only a coupling with intelligent machines but a coupling so intense and multifaceted that it is no longer possible to distinguish meaningfully between the biological organism and the infor mational circuits in which the organism is enmeshed Accompanying this change is a corresponding shift in how signification is understood and cor poreally experienced In contrast to Lacanian psycholinguistics derived from the generative coupling oflinguistics and sexuality flickering signifi cation is the progeny of the fascinating and troubling coupling oflanguage and machine Information Narratives and Bodies of Information The shift from presence and absence to pattern and randomness is en coded into every aspect of contemporary literature from the physical ob ject that constitutes the text to such staples of literary interpretation as character plot author and reader The development is by no means even some texts testify dramatically and explicitly to the shift whereas others manifest this shift only indirectly I will call those texts in which the dis placement is most apparent infonnation narratives Information narra tives show in exaggerated form changes that are more subtly present in other texts as well Whether in information narratives or contemporary fic tion generally the dynamiC of displacement is crucial One could focus on pattern in any era but the peculiarity of pattern in these texts is its inter penetration with randomness and its implicit challenge to phYSicality Pattern tends to overwhelm presence leading to a construction of immate riality that depends not on spirituality or even consciousness but only on in formation Consider William Gibsons Neuromancer 1984 the novel thatalong with the companion volumes Count Zero 1986 and Mona Lisa Overdrive 1988sparked the cyberpunk movement The Neuromancer trilogy gave a local habitation and a name to the disparate spaces of computer sim ulations networks and hypertext windows that before Gibsons interven tion had been discussed as separate phenomena Gibsons novels acted like seed crystals thrown into a supersaturated solution the time was ripe for the technology known as cyberspace to precipitate into public conscious ness In Neuromancer the narrator defines cyberspace as a consensual il lusion accessed when a user jacks into a computer Here the writers imagination outstrips existing technologies for Gibson imagines a direct neural link between the brain and the computer through electrodes An other version of this link is a socket implanted behind the ear that accepts computer chips allOwing direct neural access to computer memory Net work users collaborate in creating the richly textured landscape of cyber space a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system Unthinkable complexity Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind clusters and constellations of data Like city lights receding 23 Existing in the nonmaterial space of computer simulation cyberspace defines a regime of representation within which pattern is the essential reality presence an optical illusion Like the landscapes they negotiate the subjectivities who operate within cyberspace also become patterns rather than physical entities Case the computer cowboy who is the protagonist of Neuromancer still has a physical presence although he regards his body as so much meat that ex ists primarily to sustain his consciousness until the next time he can enter cyberspace Others have completed the transition that Cases values imply Dixie Flatline a cowboy who encountered something in cyberspace that flattened his EEG ceased to exist as a physical body and lives now as a per sonality construct within the computer defined by the magnetic patterns that store his identity The contrast between the bodys limitations and cyberspaces power highlights the advantages of pattern over presence As long as the pattern endures one has attained a kind of immortalityan implication that Hans Moravec makes explicit in Mind Children Such views are authorized by cultural conditions that make physicality seem a better state to be from than to inhabit In a world despOiled by overdevelopment overpopulation and timerelease environmental poisons it is comforting to think that phys ical forms can recover their pristine purity by being reconstituted as infor mational patterns in a multidimensional computer space A cyberspace body like a cyberspace landscape is immune to blight and corruption It is no accident that the vaguely apocalyptic landscapes of films such as Ter Virrual Bodies and Flickering Signifier I minator Blade Runner and Hardware occur in narratives focusing on cybernetic lifeforms The sense that the world is rapidly becoming unin habitable by human beings is part of the impetus for the displacement of presence by pattern These connections lie close to the surface in Neuromancer Get just wasted enough find yourself in some desperate but strangely arbitrary kind of trouble and it was possible to see Nlnsei as a field of data the way the matrix had once reminded him of proteins linking to distinguish cell specialities Then you could throw yourself into a highspeed drift and skid totally engaged but set apart from it all and all around you the dance of biz information interacting data made flesh in the mazes of the black mar ket24 The metaphOriC slippages between urban sprawl computer matrix and biolOgical protein culminate in the final elliptical phrase data made flesh Information is the putative origin physicality the derivative mani festation Body parts sold in blackmarket clinics body neurochemistry manipulated by synthetic drugs body of the world overlaid by urban sprawlall testifY to the precariousness of phYSical existence If flesh is data incarnate why not go back to the source and leave the perils of physi cality behind The reasoning presupposes that subjectivity and computer programs have a common arena in which to interact HistOrically that arena was first defined in cybernetiCS by the creation of a conceptual framework that con stitutedhumans animals and machines as informationprocessing devices receiving and transmitting Signals to effect goaldirected behavior25 Gibson matches this technical achievement with two literary innovations that allow subjectivity with its connotations of consciousness and self awareness to be articulated together with abstract data The first is a subtle modification in point of view abbreviated in the text as pov More than an acronym pov is a substantive noun that constitutes the characters subjec tivity by serving as a positional marker substituting for his absent body In its usual Jamesian sense point of view presumes the fiction of a per son who observes the action from a particular angle and tells what he sees In the preface to The Portrait of a Lady James imagines a house of fiction with a million windows formed by the need of the individual vision and by the pressure of the individual will At each window stands a figure with a pair of eyes or at least with a field glass which forms again and again for observation a unique instrument insuring to the person making use ofit an impression distinct from every other26 For James the observer is an em bodied creature and the specificity of his or her location determines what the observer can see when looking out on a scene that itself is phYSically 38  Chapter Two specific When an omniscient viewpoint is used the limitations of the nar rators corporeality begin to fall away but the suggestion of embodiment lingers in the idea of focus the scene created by the eyes movement Even for James vision is not unmediated technologically Significantly he hovers between eye and field glass as the receptor constituting vision Cyberspace represents a quantum leap fOIWard into the technological con struction of vision Instead of an embodied consciousness looking through the window at a scene consciousness moves through the screen to become the pov leaving behind the body as an unoccupied shell In cyberspace point of view does not emanate from the character rather the pov literally is the character If a pov is annihilated the character disappears with it ceasing to exist as a consciousness in and out of cyberspace The realistic fic tion of a narrator who observes but does not create is thus unmasked in cy berspace The effect is not primarily metafictional however but is in a literal sense metaphysical above and beyond phYSicality The crucial dif ference between the Jamesian point of view and the cyberspace pov is that the former implies phYSical presence whereas the latter does not Gibsons technique recalls Alain RobbeGrillets novels which were among the first information narratives to exploit the formal consequences of combining subjectivity with data In RobbeGrillets work however the effect of interfacing narrative voice with objective description was para dOxically to heighten the narrators subjectivity for certain objects like the jalousied windows or the centipede in Jealousy are inventoried with obses sive interest indicating a mindset that is anything but objective In Gibson the space in which subjectivity moves lacks this personalized stamp Cy berspace is the domain of virtual collectivity constituted as the resultant of millions of vectors representing the diverse and often conflicting interests of human and artificial intelligences linked together through computer networks27 To make this space work as a level playing field on which humans and computers can meet on equal terms Gibson introduces his second innova tion Cyberspace is created by transforming a data matrix into a landscape in which narratives can happen In mathematics matrix is a technical term denoting data that have been arranged into an ndimensional array Expressed in this form data seem as far removed from the fascinations of story as randomnumber tables are from the National Inquirer Because the array is already conceptualized in spatial terms however it is a small step to imagining the matrix as a threedimensional landscape Narrative becomes possible when this spatiality is given a temporal dimension by the povs movement through it The pov is located in space but it exists in time Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  Through the track it weaves the desires repressions and obsessions of subjectivity can be expressed The genius of Neuromancer lies in its explicit recognition that the categories Kant considered fundamental to human ex periencespace and timecan be used as a conjunction to join aware ness with data Reduced to a point the pov is abstracted into a purely temporal entity with no spatial extension metaphorized into an interactive space the datascape is narrativized by the povs movement through it Data are thus humanized and subjectivity is computerized allowing them to join in a symbiotic union whose result is narrative Such innovations carry the implications of informatics beyond the tex tual surface into the signifing processes that constitute theme and charac ter I suspect that Gibsons novels have been so influential not only because they present a vision of the posthuman future that is already upon usin this they are no more prescient than many other science fiction novels but also because they embody within their techniques the assumptions ex pressed explicitly in the themes of the novels This kind of move is possible when the cultural conditions authorizing the assumptions are pervasive enough that the posthuman is experienced as an everyday lived reality as well as an intellectual proposition The shift of emphasis from ownership to access is another manifestation of the underlying transition from presenceabsence to patternlrandom ness In The Condition ofPostrrwdernity David Harvey characterizes the economic aspects of the shift to an informatted society as a transition from a Fordist regime to a regime of flexible accumulation28 As Harvey and many others have pointed out in late capitalism durable goods yield pride of place to information29 A Significant difference between information and durable goods is replicability Information is not a conserved quantity If I give you information you have it and I do too With information the constraining factor separating the haves from the havenots is not so much possession as access Presence precedes and makes possible the idea of possession for one can possess something only if it already exists By con trast access implies pattern recognition whether the access is to a piece of land recognized as such through the boundary pattern defining that land as different from adjoining parcels confidential information constituted as confidential through the comparison of its informational patterns with lesssecure documents or a bank vault associated with knOwing the cor rectpattern of tumbler combinations In general access differs from pos session because the former tracks patterns rather than presences When someone breaks into a computer system it is not a physical presence that is detected but the informational traces that the entry has created30 40  Chapter Two When the emphasis falls on access rather than ownership the private public distinction that was so important in the formation of the novel is rad ically reconfigured Whereas possession implies the existence of private life based on physical exclusion or inclusion access implies the existence of credentialing practices that use patterns rather than presences to distin guish between those who do and those who do not have the right to enter Moreover entering is itself constituted as access to data rather than as a change in physical location In Don DeLillos White Noise 1985 for ex ample the Gladneys home traditionally the private space of family life is penetrated by noise and radiation of all wavelengthsmicrowave radio television31 The penetration signals that private spaces and the private thoughts they engender and figure are less a concern than the interplay be tween codes and the articulation of individual subjectivity with data Jack Gladneys death is prefigured for him as a pattern of pulsing stars around a computerized data display a striking image of how his corporeality has been penetrated by informational patterns that construct as well as predict his mortality Although the Gladney family still operates as a social unit albeit with the geographical dispersion endemic to postmodern life their conversations are punctuated by random bits of information emanating from the radio and Tv The punctuation points toward a mutation in subjectivity that comes from joining the focused attention of traditional novelistic con sciousness with the digitized randomness of miscellaneous bits The muta tion reaches incarnation in Willie Mink whose brain has become so addled by a deSigner drug that his consciousness is finally indistinguishable from the white noise that surrounds him Through a route different from that used by Gibson DeLillo arrives at a similar destination a vision of subjec tivity constituted through the interplay of pattern and randomness rather than presence and absence The bodies of texts are also implicated in these changes The displace ment of presence by pattern thins the tissue of textuality making it a semi permeable membrane that allows awareness of the text as an informational pattern to infuse into the space of representation When the fiction of pres ence gives way to the recognition of pattern passages are opened between the text asobject and those representations within the text that are charac teristic of the condition of virtuality Consider the play between text as physical object and as information How in Italo Calvinos If on a winters night a traveler 1979 The texts awareness of its own phYSicality is painfully apparent in the anxiety it manifests toward keeping the literary corpus intact Within the space of representation texts are subjected to Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  birth defects maimed and tom apart lost and stolen The text operates as if it knows it has a physical body and fears that its body is in jeopardy from a host of threats  from defective printing technologies and editors experienc ing middleage brain fade to nefarious political plots Most of all perhaps the text fears losing its body to information When you the reader are foiled in your pursuit of its story by the frailty of the texts physical corpus the narrator imagines you hurling the book through a closed window reducing the texts body to photons undu latory vibrations polarized spectra Not content with this pulverization you throw itthrough the wall so thatthe text breaks up into electrons neu trons neutrinos elementary particles more and more minute Still disgusted in an act of ultimate dispersion you send it through a computer line causing the textual body to be reduced to electronic impulses into the flow of information With the text shaken by redundancies and noises you let it be degraded into a Swirling entropy Yet the very story you seek can be envisioned as a pattern for that night you sleep and fight with dreams as with formless and meaningless life seeking a pattern a route that must surely be there as when you begin to read a book and you dont yet know in which direction it will carry you32 Once the texts phYSical body is interfaced with information technolo gies however the pattern that is story stands in jeopardy of being disrupted by the randomness implicit in information The disruptive power of ran domness becomes manifest when you find yourself entangled with Lotaria a reader who believes books are best read by scanning them into computers and letting the machine analyze wordfrequency patterns Seduced by Lotaria against your better judgment you get tangled up with her and with rolls of printout covering the floor The printouts contain part of the story that you desperately want to finish which Lotaria has entered into the com puter Distracted by her multiple entanglements Lotaria presses the wrong key and the rest of the story is erased in an instant demagnetization of the circuits The multicolored wires now grind out the dust of dissolved words the the of of of of from from from from that that that that in columns according to their respective frequency The book has been crum bled dissolved can no longer be recomposed like a sand dune blown away by the wind33 Now you can never achieve satiation never reach the point of satisfied completion that comes with finishing a book Your anxiety about reading interruptus is intensified by what might be called print interrup tus a print books fear that once it has been digitized the computer will gar ble its body breaking it apart and reassembling it into the nonstory of a data matrix rather than an entangled and entangling narrative This anxiety is transmitted to readers within the text who keep pursuing parts of textual bodies only to lose them as well as to readers outside the text who must try to make sense of the radically discontinuous narrative Only when the chapter titles are perceived to form a sentence is the literary corpus reconstituted as a unity Significantly the recuperation is syntactical rather than physical It does not arise from or imply an intact physical body Rather it emerges from the patternsmetaphorical grammatical narra tive thematic and textualthat the parts together make As the climactic scene in the library suggests the reconstituted corpus is a body of informa tion emerging from the discourse community among whom information circulates The textual body may be dismembered or ground into digital word dust the narrative implies but as long as there are readers who care passionately about stories and want to pursue them narrative itself can be recuperated Through such textual strategies If on a winters night testifies vividly to the impact of information technologies on bodies of books Human bodies are Similarly affected The correspondence between hu man and textual bodies can be seen as early as William Burroughss Naked Lunch written in 1959 in the decade that saw the institutionalization of cy bernetics and the construction of the first largescale electronic digital computer34 The narrative metamorphizes nearly as often as bodies within it suggesting by its cut up method a textual corpus that is as artificial het erogeneous and cybernetic as they are35 Since the fissures that mark the text always fall within the units that compose the textual bodywithin chapters paragraphs sentences and even wordsit becomes increas ingly clear that they do not function to delineate the textual corpus Rather the body of the textis produced precisely by these fissures which are not so much ruptures as productive dialectics that bring the narrative as a syntac tic and chronological sequence into being Bodies within the text follow the same logic Under the pressure of sex and addiction bodies explode or mutate protoplasm is sucked out of cocks or nostrils plots are hatched to take over the planet or nearest lifeform Burroughs anticipates Fredric Jamesons claim that an information society is the purest form of capitalism When bodies are constituted as informa tion they can be not only sold but fundamentally reconstituted in response to market pressures Junk instantiates the dynamiCS of informatics and makes clear the relation of junkasinformation to late capitalism Junk is the ideal product because the junk merchant does not sell his product to the consumer he sells the consumer to his product He does not improve and simplifY his merchandise He degrades and simplifies the client36 The junkieS body is a harbinger of the postmodern mutant for it demon Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier I by the flow of junkasinformation through points of amplification and re sistance The characteristics of information narratives include then an emphasis on mutation and transformation as a central thematic for bodies within the text as well as for the bodies of texts Subjectivity already joined with infor mation technologies through cybernetic circuits is further integrated into the circuit by novelistic techniques that combine it with data Access vies with possession as a structuring element and data are narrativized to ac commodate their integration with subjectivity In general materiality and immateriality are joined in a complex tension that is a source of exultation and strong anxiety Information technologies leave their mark on books in the realization that sooner or later the body of print will be interfaced with other media All but a handful of books printed in the United States and Europe in 1998 will be digitized during some phase of their existence Print texts such as If on a winters night a traveler bear the imprint of this digitalization in their narratives as if the text remembers the moment when it was nothing but electronic polarities on a disk At moments of crisis the repressed memory erupts onto the textual surface in the form of an acute fear that randomness will so interpenetrate its patterns that story will be lost and the textual cor pus will be reduced to a body of meaningless data These eruptions are vivid testimony that even print texts cannot escape being affected by informa tion technologies To understand more about the effects of informatics on contemporary fictions let us tum now to consider the relation between text and subjectiV ity specifically how information narratives constitute both the voice speak ing the narrative and the reader Functionalities of Narrative The very word narrator implies a voice speaking and a speaking voice im plies a sense of presence Jacques Derrida announcing the advent of gram matology focused on the gap that separates speaking from writing Such a change transforms the narrator from speaker to scribe or more precisely someone who is absent from the scene but toward whom the inscriptions point37 Informatics pushes this transformation further As writing yields to flickering signifiers underwritten by binary digits the narrator becomes not so such a scribe as a cyborg authorized to access the relevant codes The progression suggests that the dialectic between absence and presence came clearly into focus with the advent of deconstruction because it was al ready being displaced as a cultural presupposition by randomness and pat tern Presence and absence were forced into visibility so to speak because they were already losing their constitutive power to form the ground for discourse becoming instead the subject of discourse In this sense decon struction is the child of an information age formulating its theories from strata pushed upward by the emerging substrata beneath To see how the function of the narrator changes as we progress deeper into virtuality consider the seduction scene from I Was an Infinitely Hot and Dense White Dot one of the stories in Mark Leyners My Cousin My Gastroenterologist The narrator high on Sinutab and driving isotropi cally so that any destination is equally probable finds himself at a squalid little dive I dont know  but there she is I canttell if shes a human or a fifthgeneration gynemOIphic android and I dont care I crack open an ampoule of mating pheromone and let it waft across the bar as I sip my drink a methyl isocyanate on the rocksmethyl isocyanate is the substance which killed more than 2 000 people when it leaked in Bhopal India but thanks to my weight training aero bic workouts and a lowfat fiberrich diet the stuff has no effect on me Sure enough she strolls over and occupies the stool next to mine  My lips are now one angstrom unit from her lips  I begin to kiss her but she turns her head away  I cant kiss you were monozygotic replicantswe share 100 of our genetic material My head spins You are the beautiful day I exclaim your breath is a zephyr of eucalyptus that does a pas de bourre across the Sea of Galilee Thanks she says but we cant go back to my house and make love be cause monozygotic incest is forbidden by the elders What if I said I could change all that  What if I said that I had a miniature shotgun that blasts gene fragments into the cells of living organisms altering their genetic matrices so that a monozygotic replicant would no longer be a monozygotic replicant and she could then make love to a muscleman without transgressing the incest taboo I say opening my shirt and exposing the device which I had stuck in the waistband of my black jeans Howd you get that thing she gasps ogling its thick fiberreinforced plastiC barrel and the UziBiotech logo embossed on the mag azine which held two cartridges of gelated recombinant DNA I got it for Christ mas  Do you have any last words before I scramble your chromosomes I say taking aim Yes she says you first38 Much of the wit in this passage comes from the juxtaposition of folk wisdom and seduction cliches with hightech language and ideas The narrator sips a chemical that killed thousands when it leaked into the environment but Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  he is immune to damage because he eats a lowfat diet The narrator leans close to the womanandroid to kiss her but he has not yet made contact when he is an angstrom away considerably less than the diameter of a hy drogen atom The characters cannot make love because they are barred by incest taboos being replicants from the same monozygote which would make them identical twins but this does not seem to prevent them from be ing opposite sexes They are governed by kinship rules enforced by tribal elders but they have access to genetic technologies that intervene in and disrupt evolutionary modes of descent They think their problem can be solved by an UziBiotech weapon that will scramble their chromosomes but the narrator at least seems to expect their identities to survive intact Even within the confines of a short story no more than five pages long this encounter is not preceded or followed by events that relate directly to it Rather the narrative leaps from scene to scene all of them linked by only the most tenuous and arbitrary threads The incongruities make the narra tive a kind of textual android created through patterns of assembly and dis assembly There is no natural body to this text any more than there are natural bodies within the text As the title intimates identity merges with typography I was a  dot and is further conflated with such hightech reconstructions as computer simulations of gravitational collapse I was an infinitely hot and dense white dot Signifiers collapse like stellar bod ies into an explosive materiality that approaches the critical point of nova ready to blast outward into dissipating waves of flickering signification The explosive tensions between cultural codes that familiarize the ac tion and neologistic splices that dislocate traditional expectations do more than structure the narrative They also constitute the narrator who exists less as a speaking voice endowed with a plausible psychology than as a series of fissures and dislocations that push toward a new kind of subjectivity To understand the nature of this subjectivity let us imagine a trajectory that arcs from storyteller to professional to some destination beyond Walter Benjamins shared community of values and presencethe community that he had in mind when he evoked the traditional storyteller whose words are woven into the rhythms of workechoes faintly in allusions to the Song of Songs and tribal elders39 Overlaid on this is the professionalization that JeanFranois Lyotard wrote about in The Postrrwdem Condition in which the authOrity to tell the story is constituted by possessing the appropriate credentials that qualify one as a member of a physically dispersed elec tronically bound professional community4o This phase of the trajectory is Signified in a number of ways The narrator is driving isotropically in dicating that physical location is no longer necessary or relevant to the 46  Chapter Two production of the story His authority derives not from his physical partici pation in a community but from his possession of a hightech language that includes pheromones methyl isocyanate and gelated recombinant DNA not to mention the UziBiotech phallus This authority too is displaced even as it is created for the incongruities reveal that the narrative and therefore the narrator are radically unstable about to mutate into a scarcely conceivable form signified in the story by the hightech identity transforming orgasmic blast that never quite comes What is this form Its physical manifestations vary but the ability to ma nipulate complex codes is a constant The looming transformation already enacted through the language of the passage is into a subjectivity who de rives his authority from possessing the correct codes Popular literature and culture contain countless scenarios in which someone fools a computer into thinking that he or she is an authorized person because the person possesses or stumbles upon the codes that the computer recognizes as con stituting authorization Usually these scenarios imply that the person exists unchanged taking on a spurious identity that allows him or her to move un recognized within an informational system There is however another way to read these narratives Constituting identity through authorization codes the person using the codes is changed into another kind of subjectivity pre cisely one who exists and is recognized because oflmowing the codes The surface deception is underlaid by a deeper truth We become the codes we punch The narrator is not a storyteller and not a professional authority al though these functions lingerin the narrative as anachronistic allusions and wrenched referentiality Rather the narrator is a keyboarder a hacker a manipulator of codes 41 Assuming that the text was digitized at some phase in its existence in a literal sense he it is these codes The construction of the narrator as a manipulator of codes obviously has important implications for the construction of the reader The reader is similarly constituted through a layered archaeology that moves from lis tener to reader to decoder Drawing on a context that included information technologies Roland Barthes in SZ brilliantly demonstrated the possibil ity of reading a text as a production of diverse codes42 Information narra tives make that possibility an inevitability for they often cannot be understood even on a literal level without referring to codes and the infor matics that produce and are produced by these codes Flickering Significa tion extends the productive force of codes beyond the text to include the signifying processes by which the technologies produce texts as well as the interfaces that enmesh humans into integrated circuits As the circuits connecting technology text and human expand and intensifY the point Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  17 where quantitative increments shade into qualitative transformation draws closer Because codes can be sent over fiber optics essentially instantaneously there is no longer a shared stable context that helps to anchor meaning and guide interpretation Like reading decoding takes place in a location arbi trarilyfar removed in space and time from the source text In contrast to the fixity of print decoding implies that there is no original textno first edi tions no fair copies no holographic manuscripts There are only the flick ering signifiers whose transient patterns evoke and embody what c W S Trow has called the context of no context the suspicion that all contexts like all texts are electronically mediated constructions43 What binds the decoder to the system is not the stability of being a member of an interpre tive community or the intense pleasure of physically possessing the book a pleasure that all bibliophiles know Rather it is the decoders construction as a cyborg the impression that his or her physicality is also data made flesh another flickering signifier in a chain of signification that extends through many levels from the DNA that in formats the decoders body to the binary code that is the computers first language Against this dream or nightmare of the body as information what alter natives exist We can see beyond this dream I have argued by attending to the material interfaces and technologies that make disembodiment such a powerful illusion By adopting a double vision that looks simultaneously at the power of simulation and at the materialities that produce it we can bet ter understand the implications of articulating posthuman constructions together with embodied actualities One way to think about these material ities is through functionality Functionality is a term used by virtual real ity technologists to describe the communication modes that are active in a computerhuman interface If the user wears a data glove for example hand motions constitute one functionality If the computer can respond to voiceactivated commands voice is another functionality If the computer can sense body position spatial location is yet another functionality Func tionalities work in both directions that is they describe the computers ca pabilities and also indicate how the users sensorymotor apparatus is being trained to accommodate the computers responses Working with a VR sim ulation the user learns to move his or her hand in stylized gestures that the computer can accommodate In the process the neural configuration of the users brain experiences changes some of which can be longlasting The computer molds the human even as the human builds the computer When narrative functionalities change a new kind of reader is produced by the text The material effects of flickering signification ripple outward 48  Chapter Two because readers are trained to read through different functionalities which can affect how they interpret any text including texts written before computers were invented The impatience that some readers now feel with print texts for example no doubt has a physiological as well as a psycholog ical basis They miss pushing the keys and seeing the cursor blinking at them Conversely other readers or perhaps the same readers in different moods go back to print with a renewed appreciation for its durability its sturdiness and its ease of use I began to appreciate certain qualities of print only after I had experience with computers When I open a book it almost always works and it can maintain backward compatibility for hun dreds of years I also appreciate that on some occasionswhen I am revis ing a piece of writing for examplethere isnt a cursor blinking at me as if demanding a response With print I can take as long as I want and the pages never disappear or shut themselves down As these examples illustrate changes in narrative functionalities are deeper than the structural or the matic characteristics of a specific genre for they shift the embodied re sponses and expectations that different kinds of textualities evoke Arguing from a different historical context Friedrich Kittler made a similar point when he wrote about medial ecology44 When new media are introduced the changes transform the environment as a whole This transformation affects the niches that older media have carved for themselves so they change also even if they are not directly involved with the new media Books will not remain unaffected by the emergence of new media If my assessmentthat the emphasis on information technologies fore grounds patternrandomness and pushes presenceabsence into the back groundis correct the implications extend beyond narrative into many cultural arenas As I indicated in chapter 1 one of the most serious of these implications is a systematic devaluation of materiality and embodiment I find this trend ironic for changes in material conditions and embodied ex perience are precisely what give the shift its deep roots in everyday experi ence Implicit in nearly everything I have written here is the assumption that presence and pattern are opposites existing in antagonistic relation The more emphasis that falls on one the less the other is noticed and val ued Entirely different readings emerge when one entertains the possibil ity that pattern and presence are mutually enhanCing and supportive Paul Virilio has observed that one cannot ask whether information technolOgies should continue to be developed45 Given market forces already at work it is virtually if I may use the word certain that we will increasingly live work and play in environments that construct us as embodied virtuali ties46 I believe that our best hope to intervene constructively in this de Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifier  velopment is to put an interpretive spin on it one that opens up the possi bilities of seeing pattern and presence as complementary rather than an tagonistic Information like humanity cannot exist apart from the embodiment that brings it into being as a material entity in the world and embodiment is always instantiated local and specific Embodiment can be destroyed but it cannot be replicated Once the specific form constituting it is gone no amount of massaging data will bling it back This observation is as true of the planet as itis of an individuallifeform As we rush to explore the new vistas that cyberspace has made available for colonization let us re member the fragility of a material world that cannot be replaced  Cha  pLer  Thre  e CONTESTING FOR THE BODY OF INFORMATION THE MACY CONFERENCES ON CYBERNETICS When and where did information get constructed as a disembodied medium How were researchers convinced that humans and machines are brothers under the skin Although the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics were notthe only forum grappling with these questions they were particu larly important because they acted as a crossroads for the traffic in cyber netic models and artifacts This chapter charts the arguments that made information seem more important than materiality within this research community Broadly speaking the arguments were deployed along three fronts The first was concerned with the construction of information as a theoretical entity the second with the construction of human neural structures so that they were seen as flows of information the third with the construction of artifacts that translated information flows into observable operations thereby making the flows real Yet at each of these fronts there was also significant resistance to the reification of information Alternate models were proposed important qualifications were voiced objections were raised to the disparity between simple artifacts and the complex problems they addressed Reification was triumphant not because it had no opposition but because scientifically and culturally situated debates made it seem a better choice than the alterna tives Recovering the complexities of these debates helps to demystifY the assumption that information is more essential than matter or energy Fol lowed backto moments before it became a black box this conclusion seems less like an inevitability and more like the result of negotiations specific to the circumstances of the US technoscientific culture during and imme diately follOwing World War II The Macy Conferences were unusual in that participants did not pre sent finished papers Rather speakers were invited to sketch out a few Contesting for the Body of Information  main ideas to initiate discussion The discussions rather than the presen tations were the center of interest Designed to be intellectual freefor alls the conferences were radically interdisciplinary The transcripts show that researchers from a wide variety of fieldsneurophysiology electrical engineering philosophy semantics literature and psychology among othersstruggled to understand one another and make connec tions between others ideas and their own areas of expertise In the process a concept that may have begun as a model of a particular physical system came to have broader significance acting Simultaneously as mechanism and metaphor The dynamics of the conferences facilitated this mixing Researchers might not have been able to identify in their own work the mechanism dis cussed by a fellow participant but they could understand it metaphorically and then associate the metaphor with something applicable to their own field The process appears repeatedly throughout the transcripts When Claude Shannon used the word information for example he employed it as a technical term having to do with message probabilities When Gregory Bateson appropriated the same word to talk about initiation rituals he in terpreted it metaphorically as a difference that makes a difference and associated it with feedback loops between contesting social groups As mechanism and metaphor were compounded concepts that began with narrow definitions spread out into networks of broader Significance Ear lier I called these networks constellations suggesting that during the Macy period the emphaSiS was on homeostasis This chapter explores the elements that came together to form the homeostasis constellation it also demonstrates the chain of associations that bound refleXivity together with subjectivity during the Macy period which fix many of the phYSical scien tists was enough to relegate reflexivity to the category of nonscience rather than science Tracing the development of reflexive epistemologies after the Macy period ended the chapter concludes by showing how re flexivitywas modified so that it could count as prodUCing scientific knowl edge during the second wave of cybernetics The Meaninglessness of Information The triumph of information over materiality was a major theme at the first Macy Conference John von Neumann and Norbert Wiener led the way by making clear that the important entity in the manmachine equation was information not energy Although energy considerations are not entirely absent von Neumann discussed at length the problems involved in dissi pating the heat generated from vacuum tubes the thermodynamics of heat was incidental Central was how much information could flow through the system and how quickly it could move Wiener emphasizing the move ment from energy to information made the point explicitly The funda mental idea is the message    and the fundamental element of the message is the decisionl Decisions are important not because they pro duce material goods but because they produce information Control infor mation and power follows But what counts as information We sawin chapter 1 that Claude Shan non defined information as a probability function with no dimensions no materiality and no necessary connection with meaning Although a full exposition of information theory is beyond the scope of this book the fol lowing explanation adapted from an account by Wiener will give an idea of the underlying reasoning 2 Like Shannon Wiener thought of informa tion as representing a choice More specifically it represents a choice of one message from among a range of possible messages Suppose there are thirtytwo horses in a race and we want to bet on Number 3 The bookie suspects the police have tapped his telephone so he has arranged for his clients to use a code He studied communication theory perhaps he was in one of the summerschool classes on communication theory that Wiener taught at UCLA and he knows that any message can be communicated through a binary code When we call up his voice program asks if the number falls in the range ofl to 16 fit does we punch the number 1 if not the number 0 We use this same code when the voice program asks if the number falls in the range of 1 to 8 then the range of 1 to 4 and next the range of 1 to 2 Now the program knows that the number must be ei ther 3 or 4 so it says lf3 press 1 if 4 press 0 and a final tap communi cates the number Using these binary divisions we need five responses to communicate our choice How does this simple decision process translate into information First let us generalize our result Probability theory states that the number ofbi nary choices C necessary to uniquely identify an element from a set with n elements can be calculated as follows c  log2n In our case C  log232  5 the five choices we made to convey our desired selection Hereafter to simplify the notation consider all logarithms taken to base 2 Working Contesting for the Body of Information  from this formula Wiener defined information I as the log of the number n of elements in the message set  logn This fonnula gives  when the elements are equally likely Usually this is not the case in English for example the letter e is far more likely to occur than z For the more general situation when the elementss l S2 S3  sn are not equally likely and ps is the probability that the element s will be chosen s  log IIpsi  logpsJ This is the general formula for information communicated by a specific event in our case the call to the bookie Because electrical engineers must design circuits to handle a variety of messages they are less interested in specific events than they are in the average amount of information from a source for example the average of all the different messages that a client might communicate about the horse race This more complex case is rep resented by the following formula  ps logpsJ where ps is the probability that the message element Si will be selected from a message set with n elements indicates the sum of terms as i varies from 1 ton3 We are now in a position to understand the deeper implications ofinfor mation as it was theorized by Wiener and Shannon Note that the theory is formulated entirely without reference to what information means Only the probabilities of message elements enter into the equations Why di vorce information from meaning Shannon and Wiener wanted informa tion to have a stable value as it moved from one context to another If it was tied to meaning it would potentially have to change values every time it was embedded in a new context because context affects meaning Suppose for example you are in a windowless office and call to ask about the weather Its raining I say On the other hand if we are both standing on a street comer being drenched by a downpour this same response would have a very different meaning In the first case I am telling you something you dont know in the second I am being ironic or perhaps moronic An in formation concept that ties information to meaning would have to yield two different values for the two circumstances even though the message Its raining is the same To cut through this Gordian knot Shannon and Wiener defined infor mation so that it would be calculated as the same value regardless of the 54  Chapter Three contexts in which it was embedded which is to say they divorced it from meaning In context this was an appropriate and sensible decision Taken out of context the definition allowed information to be conceptualized as if it were an entity that can How unchanged between different material sub strates as when Moravec envisions the information contained in a brain being downloaded into a computer Ironically this reification of informa tion is enacted through the same kind of decontextualizing moves that the theory uses to define information as such The theory decontextualizes in formation Moravec decontextualizes the theory Thus a Simplification ne cessitated by engineering considerations becomes an ideology in which a reified concept of information is treated as if it were fully commensurate with the complexities of human thought4 Shannon himself was meticulously careful about how he applied infor mation theory repeatedly stressing that information theory concerned only the efficient transmission of messages through communication chan nels not what those messages mean Although others were quick to impute larger linguistic and social implications to the theory he resisted these at tempts Responding to a presentation by Alex Bavelas on group communi cation at the eighth Macy Conference he cautioned that he did not see too close a connection between the notion of information as we use it in com munication engineering and what you are doing here  the problem here is not so much finding the best encoding of symbols  but rather the de termination of the semantic question of what to send and to whom to send it5 For Shannon defining information as a probability function was a strategic choice that enabled him to bracket semantics He did not want to get involved in having to consider the receivers mindset as part of the com munication system He felt so strongly on this point that he suggested Bavelas distinguish between information in a channel and information in a human mind by characterizing the latter through subjective probabili ties although how these were to be defined and calculated was by no means clear Not everyone agreed that it was a good idea to decontextualize informa tion At the same time that Shannon and Wiener were forging what in formation would mean in a US context Donald MacKay a British researcher was trying to formulate an information theory that would take meaning into account At the seventh conference he presented his ideas to the Macy group The difference between his view and Shannons can be seen in the way he bridled at Shannons suggestion about subjective prob abilities In the rhetoric of the Macy Conferences objective was associ ated with being scientific whereas subjective was a code word implying Contesting for the Body of Information I magnificent but were certainly not science MacKays first move was to res cue information that affected the receivers mindset from the subjective label He proposed that both Shannon and Bavelas were concerned with what he called selective information that is information calculated by considering the selection of message elements from a set But selective in formation alone is not euough also required is another kind of information that he called structural Structural information indicates how selective information is to be understood it is a message about how to interpret a messagethat is it is a metacommunication To illustrate say I launch into a joke and it falls Bat In that case I may re sort to telling my interlocutor Thats a joke The information content of this message considered as selective information measured in metrons is calculated with probability functions similar to those used in the Shannon Wiener theory In addition my metacomment also carries structural infor mation measured in logons for it indicates that the preceding message has one kind of structure rather than another a joke instead of a serious statement In another image MacKay liked to use he envisioned selective information as choosing among folders in a file drawer whereas structural information increased the number of drawers jokes in one drawer aca demic treatises in another Since structural information indicates how a message should be inter preted semantics necessarily enters the picture In sharp contrast to mes sage probabilities which have no connection with meaning structural information was to be calculated through changes brought about in the re ceivers mind Its raining heard by someone in a windowless office would yield a value for the structural information different from the value that it would yield when heard by someone looking out a window at rain To em phaSize the correlation between structural information and changes in the receivers mind MacKay offered an analogy It is as if we had discovered how to talk quantitatively about size through discovering its effects on the measuring apparatus6 The analogy implies that representations created by the mind have a double valence Seen from one perspective they contain information about the world Its raining From another perspective they are interactive phenomena that point back to the observer for this informa tion is quantified by measuring changes in the measuring instrument that is in the mind itself And how does one measure these changes An observer looks at the mind of the person who received the message which is to say that changes are made in the observers mind which in tum can also be ob served and measured by someone else The progression tends toward the infinite regress characteristic of reflexivity Arguing for a strong correlation between the nature of a representation and its effect MacKays model rec ognized the mutual constitution of form and content message and receiver His model was fundamentally different from the ShannonWiener theory because it triangulated between reflexivity information and meaning In the context of the Macy Conferences his conclusion qualified as radical subjectivity far from being a morass to be avoided is precisely what enables information and meaning to be connected The problem was how to quantifY the model To achieve quantification a mathematical model was needed for the changes that a message triggered in the receivers mind The staggering problems this presented no doubt explain why MacKays version of information theory was not widely ac cepted among the electrical engineers who would be writing reading and teaching the textbooks on information theory in the coming decades Al though MacKays work continued to be foundational for the British school of information theory in the V nited States the ShannonWiener definition of information not MacKays became the industry standard Not everyone in the V nited States capitulated As late as 1968 Nicolas S Tzannes an information theorist working for the VS government sent Warren McCulloch a memorandum about his attempt to revise MacKays theory so that it would be more workable He wanted to define informa tion so that its meaning varied with context and he looked to Kotellys con text algebra for a way to handle these changes quantitatively In the process he made an important observation He pOinted out that whereas Shannon and Wiener define information in terms of what it is MacKay defines it in terms of what it does 8 The formulation emphasizes the reification that in formation undergoes in the ShannonWiener theory Stripped of context it becomes a mathematical quantity weightless as sunshine moving in a rarefied realm of pure probability not tied down to bodies or material in stantiations The price it pays for this universality is its divorce from repre sentation When information is made representational as in MacKays model it is conceptualized as an action rather than a thing Verblike it be comes a process that someone enacts and thus it necessarily implies con text and embodiment The price it pays for embodiment is difficulty of quantification and loss of universality In the choice between what information is and what it does we can see the rival constellations of homeostasis and reflexivity beginning to take shape Making information a thing allies it with homeostasis for so defined it can be transported into any medium and maintain a stable quantitative value reinforcing the stability that homeostasis implies Making informa Contesting for the Body of Information  tion an action links it with reflexivity for then its effect on the receiver must be taken into account and measuring this effect sets up the potential for a reflexive spiral through an infinite regress of observers Homeostasis won in the first wave largely because it was more manageable quantitatively Re flexivity lost because specifYing and delimiting context quickly ballooned into an unmanageable project At every point these outcomes are tied to the historical contingencies of the situationthe definitions offered the models proposed the techniques available the allies and resources mobi lized by contending participants for their views Conceptualizing informa tion as a disembodied entity was not an arbitrary decision but neither was it inevitable The tension between reified models and embodied complexities figures importantly in the next episode of our story If humans are information processing machines then they must have biological equipment enabling them to process binary code The model constructing the human in these terms was the McCullochPitts neuron The McCullochPitts neuron was the primary model through which cybernetics was seen as having a setting in the flesh as Warren McCulloch put it The problem was how to move from this strippeddown neural model to such complex issues as universals in thought gestalts in perception and representations of what a system cannot represent Here the slippage between mechanism and model be comes important for even among researchers dedicated to a hardscience approach such as McCulloch the tendency was to use the model meta phOrically to forge connections between relatively simple neural circuits and the complexities of embodied experience In the process the disem bodied logical form of the circuit was rhetorically transformed from being an effect of the model to a cause of the models efficacy This move familiar to us as the Platonic backhand made embodied reality into a blurred and messy instantiation of the clean abstractions oflogical forms Unlike others who make this move however McCulloch never relinquished his commit ment to embodiment The tension between logical form and embodiment in his work displays how the construction of a weightless information was complicated when cybernetics moved into the intimate context of the bodys own neural functioning Neural Nets as Logical Operators Warren McCulloch figured large in the Macy Conferences He chaired the meetings and according to all accounts was a strong leader who exercised considerable control over who was allowed to speak and who was not He had studied philosophy under F S C Northrop and was familiar with Rudolf Carnaps propositional lOgic When he turned to neurophysiology he was driven by two questions as much philosophical as scientific What is a number that a man may know it and a man that he may know a num ber9 He sought the answers in a model of a neuron that he envisioned as having two aspectsone physical the other symboliC The McCulloch Pitts neuron as it came to be called was enormously influential Although it has now been modified in significant ways for a generation of researchers it provided the standard model of neural functioning In its day it repre sented a triumph of experimental work and theoretical reasoning As Steve Heims points out it was not easy to extrapolate from amorphous pink tissue on the laboratory table to the clean abstractions of the model 10 Before complicating our story by looking at the interplay between lOgical form and complex embodiment let us first consider the model on its own terms The McCullochPitts neuron has inputs that can be either excitatory or inhibitory A threshold determines how much excitation is needed for it to fire A neuron fires only if the excitation of its inputs exceeds the inhibition by at least the amount of the threshold Neurons are connected into nets Each net has a set ofinputs Signals coming in to neurons in the net an out put set signals leading out from neurons in the net and a set of internal states determined by input output and Signals from neurons that operate inside the net but are not connected to incoming or outgoing neurons McCullochs central inSight was that neurons connected in this way are ca pable of signifYing logical propositions For example if neurons A and Bare connected to C and both are necessary for C to fire this situation corre sponds to the proposition If A and B are both true then C is true If either A or B can cause C to fire the signified proposition is If A or B is true then C is true IfB is inhibitory and C will fire on input from A only if B does not fire the signified proposition is c is true only if A is true and B is not true This much McCulloch had formulated by 1941 when he met Walter Pitts a brilliant and eccentric seventeenyearold who was to become his most im portant collaborator11 Pitts worked out the mathematics proving several important theorems about neural nets In particular he showed that a neural net can calculate any number that is any proposition that can be calculated by a Turing machine12 The proof was important because it joined a model of human neural functioning with automata theory Demonstrating that the operations of a McCullochPitts neural net and a Turing machine formally converge confirmed McCullochs insight that brains do not secrete thought as the liver secretes bile but  they compute thought the way electronic computers calculate numbers13 Contesting for the Body of Information  Although McCulloch knew as well as anyone that the McCullochPitts neuron was a simplified schematic of an actual neurons complexity not to mention the brains complexity he pushed toward connecting the opera tions of a neural net directly with human thought In his view when a neu ron receives an input related to a sensory stimulus its firing is a direct consequence of something that happened in the external world When he says a proposition calculated by a neural net is true he means that the event to which the firing refers really happened How did McCulloch ac count for hallucinations and such phenomena as causalgia an amputees burning sensation that refers to a limb no longer present He proposed that neural nets can set up reverberating loops that once started continue fir ing even though no new Signals are incoming To distinguish between fir ings signifying an external event and those caused by past history he called the former signals and the latter signs A Signal always implies its occa sion but a sign is an enduring affair which has lost its essential temporal reference14 The multiple meanings that McCulloch and his colleagues attached to reverberating loops indicate how quickly speculation leaped from the simplified model to highly complex phenomena Lawrence Kubie linked reverberating loops with the repetitive and obsessive qualities of neuroses numerous Macy participants suggested that the loops could ac count for gestalt perception and McCulloch himself connected them not only with phYSical sensations but also with universals in philosophical thought lo5 The gap between the relatively simple model and the complex phenom ena it was supposed to explain is the subject of an exchange of letters be tween McCulloch and HansLukas Teuber a young psychologist who joined the Macy group on the fourth meeting and later became a coeditor of the published transcripts Here in correspondence with a junior col league McCulloch lays bare the assumptions that make embodied reality derivative from logical form In a letter dated November 101947 Teuber argues that similarity in outcome between different cybernetic systems does not necessarily imply similarity in structure or process Your robot may become capable of doing innumerable tricks the nervous system is able to do it is still unlikely that the nervous system uses the same methods as the robot in arriving at what might look like identical results Your mod els remain modelsunless some platonic demon mediate between the investigators of organic structure and the diagrammaking mathemati cians Only the psychologist he claims can give the neurophysiologist in formation on what the most relevant aspects of the recipient structures in sensory function might be16 Cybernetic mechanisms do not signify un 60  Chapter Three less they are connected with how perception actually takes place in human observers In his response on December 101947 McCulloch explained his posi tion I look to mathematics including symbolic logic for a statement of a theory in terms so general that the creations of God and man must exem plifY the processes prescribed by that theory Just because the theory is so general as to fit robot and man it lacks the specificity required to indicate mechanism in man to be the same as mechanism in robot In this argu ment universality is achieved by bracketing or blackbOxing the specific mechanisms It emerges by erasing particularity and looking for general forms Rhetorically however McCulloch presents the theory as though it preexisted specific mechanisms and then was later imperfectly instantiated in them This backhanded swing invests the theory with a coercive power that cannot be ignored for it expresses a law so general that every circuit built by God or man must exemplify itin some form 17 In actuality the theorem to which McCulloch refers is proved only in re lation to the simplified model of a McCullochPitts neural net It therefore can have the coercive power he claims for it only if the assumptions made for the model also hold for embodied actuality a congruence that can be ex act only if the model is as complex and noisy as reality itself Building such a model would of course defeat the purpose of modelmaking as Lewis Carroll and later Jorge Luis Borges playfully points out when he imagines a kings mad cartographer who is satisfied only when he creates a map that covers the entire kingdom reflecting its every detail in a scale of 1118 Teuber points to a gap when he ironically asks if some platonic demon is mediating between organic structure and abstract diagrams a gap that has not been closed despite McCullochs backhand volley In a feminist critique of the history oflogic Andrea Nye traces similar Platonic backhands that were made to develop a logiC coercive in its lawlike power 19 Nye points out that such moves are always made in specific politi cal and historical contexts in which they have important social implica tionsimplications that are masked by being presenting as preexisting laws of nature20 Like the logicians McCulloch stripped away context to expose or create a universal form But unlike the lOgicians McCulloch in 1947 does notwantto leave embodied reality behind He is searching for an empirical epistemology a way of combining embodied actuality with the force oflogical propositions Teubers objections hit a nerve or neuron be cause he insisted that the abstraction is not the actuality Dedicated to an empirical epistemology McCulloch cannot rest con tent with interpreting logical form as a universal command that embodied Contesting for the Body of Information I flesh must obey A suture is needed to bind the flesh more tightly to the model The suture appears in his invocation of mechanisms that had previ ously been blackboxed in his appeal to universality He recounts two in stances when circuits he had sketched out for patternrecognition in robots were identified by colleagues as accurate representations of the auditory and visual portions of the cortexin humans Now McCullochlike a knight that moved from the diagonal to attack the queen exposes the queen to the bishops attack as wellhas caught Teuber in a twopronged attack In the first approach humans and robots are judged alike because they obey the same universal law whatever their mechanisms In the sec ond approach humans and robots are judged alike because they use the same mechanisms This double attack is also invoked as we shall see in the next chapter by Norbert Wiener and his collaborators when a young up start philosopher took issue with their cybernetic manifesto It tends to appear when cybernetic arguments are challenged because it allows a de fense on two fronts Simultaneously If mechanisms are blackboxed so that only behavior counts humans and robots look the same because they can be made to behave the same If the black boxes are opened up and viewed from carefully controlled perspectives the mechanisms inside the boxes look the same again demonstrating the equivalence How can the queen be saved By recognizing that the abstractions here are multilayered When McCulloch goes down a level away from what in formation is toward what it does he still ends up several layers away from embodied complexity Consider his claim that patternrecognition circuits in a robot mechanism and in a human cortex are the same These circuits are diagrams that have been abstracted from two different kinds of embod iments neural tissue for the human and vacuum tubes or silicon chips for the robot Although there may be a level of abstraction at which similarities can be made to appear there is also a level of specificity at which differ ences create a Significant gap It depends on how the perspective is con structed Controlling the context particularly the movement from instantiated specificity to abstraction was crucial to constructing the path ways through which the McCullochPitts neuron was made to stand simul taneously for a computer code and for human thought Transforming the body into a flow of binary code pulSing through neurons was an essential step in seeing human being as an informational pattern In context this transformation can be seen as a necessary Simplification that made an im portant contribution to neurophysiology Taken out of context it is extrapo lated to the unwarranted conclusion that there is no essential difference between thought and code 62  Chapter Three I admire McCulloch because he made the audacious leap from amor phous tissue to lOgical model I admire him even more because he resisted the leap Although he emphasized the ability of his neurons to formulate propositions he never saw them as disembodied He was aware that infor mation moves only through signals and that Signals have existence only if they are embodied By definition a Signal is a proposition embodied in a physical process he asserted in a speech entitled How Nervous Struc tures Have Ideas to the American Neurological Association in 194921 In the context of his writing as a whole a commitment to embodiment exists in dynamic tension with an equally strong proclivity to see embodiment as the instantiation of abstract propositions This tension can be seen in the manuscript version of Whats in the Brain That Ink May Character dated August 28 1964 McCulloch re counts about a recent trip to Ravello I was told that an automaton or a nerve net like me was a mapping of a free monoid onto a semigroup with the possible addition of identity The parenthetical like me points up the incongruity between a highly abstract mathematical model involving monoids and semigroups and the embodied creature who pens these lines This is the same sort of nonsense one finds in the writings of those who never understood abstract form as an embodiment he continues It is like mistaking a Chomsky language for a real language You will find no such categorical confusion in the original Pitts and McCulloch of 1943 There the temporal propositional expressions are events occurring in time and space in a phYSically real net The postulated neurons for all their oversim plifications are still physical neurons as truly as the chemists atoms are physical atoms22 Here in the slippages between abstract propositions models of neurons and physically real nets we can see McCulloch trying to keep three balls in the air at once Although the neurons are onlypostu lated and are admittedly oversimplifications McCulloch fiercely wants to insist they are still phYSical Ifhe does not entirely succeed in creating an empirical epistemology he nevertheless achieves no small feat in insist ing that none of the balls can be dropped without sacrificing the complexi ties of embodied thought The McCullochPitts neuron is a liminal object part abstraction and part embodied actuality but other models were more firmly in the material realm Part of what made cybernetics convincing to Macy participants and others were the electromechanical devices that showed cybernetiC princi ples in action CybernetiCS was powerful because it worked If you dont be lieve watch William Grey Walters robot tortoise returning to its cage for an electrochemical nip when its batteries are running low or see Wieners Contesting for the Bode of Information  avoid it These devices were simple mechanisms by contemporary stan dards Nevertheless they served an important function because they acted as material instantiations of the momentous conclusion that humans and robots are siblings under the skin Particularly important for the Macy Con ferences were Shannons electronic rat a goalseeking machine that mod eled a rat learning a maze and Ross AshbyS homeostat a device that sought to return to a steady state when disturbed These artifacts functioned as ex changers that brought man and machine into equivalence they shaped the kinds of stories that participants would tell about the meaning of this equiv alence In conjunction with the formal theories they helped to construct the human as cyborg The Rat and the Homeostat Looping between Concept and Artifact There are moments of clarity when participants came close to explicitly ar ticulating the presuppositions informing the deep structure of the discus sion At the seventh conference John Stroud of the US Naval Electronic Laboratory in San Diego pOinted to the farreaching implications of Shannons construction of information through the binary distinction be tween Signal and noise Mr Shannon is perfectly justified in being as arbi trary as he wishes Stroud observed We who listen to him must always keep in mind that he has done so Nothing that comes out of rigorous argu ment will be uncontaminated by the particular set of decisions that were made by him at the beginning and it is rather dangerous at times to gener alize If we at any time relax our awareness of the way in which we Originally defined the signal we thereby automatically call all of the remainder of the received message the not signal or noise23 As Stroud realized Shannons distinction between Signal and noise had a conservative bias that privileges stasis over change Noise interferes with the messages exact replication which is presumed to be the desired result The structure of the theory im plied that change was deviation and that deviation should be corrected By contrast MacKays theory had as its generative distinction the difference in the state of the receivers mind before and after the message arrived In his model information was not opposed to change it was change Applied to goalseeking behavior the two theories pointed in different directions Privileging signal over noise Shannons theory implied that the goal was a preexisting state toward which the mechanism would move by making a series of distinctions between correct and incorrect choices The goal was stable and the mechanism would achieve stability when it reached 64  Chaprer Three the goal This construction easily led to the implication that the goal for mulated in general and abstract terms was less a specific site than stability itself Thus the construction ofinformation as a signalnoise distinction and the privileging of homeostasis produced and were produced by each other By contrast MacKays theory implied that the goal was not a fixed point but was a changing series of values that varied with context In his model set ting a goal temporarily marked a state that itself would become enfolded into a reflexive spiral of change In the same way that signalnoise and homeostasis went together so did reflexivity and information as a signifying difference These correlations imply that before Shannons electronic rat ever set marker in maze it was constituted through assumptions that affected how it would be interpreted Although Shannon called his device a mazesolv ing machine the Macy group quickly dubbed it a rat24 The machine con sisted of a fivebyfive square grid through which a sensing finger moved An electric jack that could be plugged into any of the twentyfive squares marked the goal and the machines task was to move through the squares by orderly search procedures until it reached the jack The machine could remember previous search patterns and either repeat them or not depending on whether they had been successful Although Heinz von Foerster Margaret Mead and Hans Teuberin their introduction to the eighth conference volumehighlighted the electronic rats significance they also acknowledged its limitations We all know that we ought to study the organism and not the computers if we wish to understand the organ ism Differences in levels of organization may be more than quantitative They go on to argue however that the computing robot provides us with analogs that are helpful as far as they seem to hold and no less helpful whenever they break down To find out in what ways a nervous system or a social group differs from our manmade analogs requires experiment These experiments would not have been considered if the analog had not been proposed25 There is another way to understand this linkage By suggesting certain kinds of experiments the analogs between intelligent machines and hu mans construct the human in terms of the machine Even when the experi ment fails the basic terms of the comparison operate to constitute the signifying difference If I say a chicken is not like a tractor I have character ized the chicken in terms of the tractor no less than when I assert that the two are alike In the same way whether they are understood as like or un like ranging human intelligence alongside an intelligent machine puts the two into a relay system that constitutes the human as a special kind of infor Contesting for the Body of Information  mation machine and the information machine as a special kind ofhuman26 Although some characteristics of the analogy may be explicitly denied the basic linkages it embodies cannot be denied for they are intrinsic to being able to think the model Presuppositions embodied in the electronic rat in clude the idea that both humans and cybernetic machines are goalseeking mechanisms that learn through corrective feedback to reach a stable state Both are information processors that tend toward homeostasis when they are functioning correctly Given these assumptions it was perhaps predictable that refleXivity should be constructed as neurosis in this model Shannon demonstrating how his electronic rat could get caught in a reflexive loop that would keep it Circling endlessly around remarked It has established a vicious circle or a singing condition27 Singing condition is a phrase that Warren McCulloch and Warren Pitts had used in an earlier presentation to de scribe neuroses modeled through cybernetic neural nets If machines are like humans in having neuroses humans are like machines in having neu roses that can be modeled mechanically Linking humans and machines in a common circuit the analogy constructs both of them as steady state sys tems that become patholOgical when they fall into reflexivity This kind of mutually constitutive interaction belies the implication inscribed in the volumes introduction that such analogs are neutral heuristic devices More accurately they are relay systems that transport assumptions from one arena to the next28 The assumptions traveling across the relay system set up by homeostasis are perhaps most visible in the discussion ofW Ross AshbyS homeostat 29 The homeostat was an electrical device constructed with transducers and variable resistors When it received an input changing its state it searched for the configuration of variables that would return it to its initial condition Ashby explained that the homeostat was meant to model an organism which must keep essential variables within preset limits to survive He em phaSized that the cost of exceeding those limits is death If homeostasis equals safety Your life would be safe Ashby responded when demon strating how the machine could return to homeostasis departure from homeostasis threatens death p 79 One of his examples concerns an engi neer sitting at the control panel of a ship The engineer functions like a homeostat striving to keep the dials within certain limits to prevent cata strophe Human and machine are alike in needing stable interior environ ments The human keeps the shipS interior stable and this stability preserves the homeostasis of the humans interior in turn allOwing the hu man to continue to ensure the shipS homeostasis Arguing that homeosta 66  Chapter Three sis is a requirement uniform among the inanimate and the animate Ashby privileged it as a universally desirable state p 73 The postwar context for the Macy Conferences played an important role in formulating what counted as homeostasis Given the cataclysm of the war it seemed selfevident that homeostasis was meaningful only ifit included the environment as part of the picture Thus Ashby conceived of the homeostat as a device that included both the organism and the environment Our ques tion is how the organism is going to struggle with its environment he re marked and if that question is to be treated adequately we must assume some speCific environment pp 7374 This specificity was expressed through the homeostats four units which could be arranged in various con figurations to simulate organismplusenvironment For example one unit could be designated organism and the remaining three the environment in another arrangement three of the units might be the organism with the remaining one the environment Formulated in general terms the prob lem the homeostat addressed was this given some function of the environ ment E can the organism find an inverse function 1 such that the product of the two will result in a steady state When Ashby asked Macy participants whether such a solution could be found for highly nonlinear systems Julian Bigelow correctly answered In general no p 75 Yet as Walter Pitts ob served the fact that an organism continues to live means that a solution does exist More preCisely the problem was whether a solution could be articu lated within the mathematical conventions and technologies of representa tion available to express it These limits in tum were constituted through the models specificities that translated between the question in the abstract and the particular question posed by that experiment Thus the emphasis shifted from finding a solution to stating the problem This dynamic appears repeatedly throughout the Macydiscussions Par ticipants increasingly understood the ability to specifY exactly what was wanted as the limiting factor for building machines that could perform hu man functions Von Neumann stated the thesis at the first conference and Walter Pitts restated it near the end of the meetings at the ninth confer ence At the very beginning of these meetings Pitts recalled the ques tion was frequently under discussion of whether a machine could be built which would do a particular thing and of course the answer which every body has realized by now is that as long as you definitely speCify what you want the machine to do you can in principle build a machine to do it p 107 After the conferences were over McCulloch repeated this dy namic in Embodiments of Mind EchOing across two decades the assertion has important implications for language Contesting for the Body of Information I If what is exactly stated can be done by a machine the residue of the uniquely human becomes coextensive with the linguistic qualities that in terfere with precise specificationambiguity metaphoric play multiple encoding and allusive exchanges between one symbol system and another The uniqueness of human behavior thus becomes assimilated to the ineffa bility of language and the common ground that humans and machines share is identified with the univocality of an instrumental language that has banished ambiguity from its lexicon Through such chunking processes the constellations of homeostasis and reflexivity assimilated other elements into themselves On the side of homeostasis was instrumental language whereas ambiguity allusion and metaphor stood with reflexivity By todays standards Ashbys homeostat was a simple machine but it had encoded within it a complex network of assumptions Paradoxically the models simplicity facilitated the overlay of assumptions onto the arti fact for its very lack of complicating detail meant that the model stood for much more than it physically enacted During discussion Ashbyacknowl edged that the homeostat was a simple model and asserted that he would like to get on to the more difficult case of the clever animal that has a lot of nervous system and is nevertheless trying to get itself stable p 97 The slippage between the simplicity of the model and the complexity of the phenomena did not go unremarked J Z Young from the Anatomy De partment at University College London sharply responded Actually that is experimentally rather dangerous You are all talking about the cortex and you have it very much in mind Simpler systems have only a limited number of possibilities p 100 Yet the simpler systems helped to reinforce sev eral ideas humans are mechanisms that respond to their environments by trying to maintain homeostasis the function of scientific language is exact speCification the bottleneck for creating intelligent machines lies in for mulating problems exactly and an information concept that privileges ex actness over meaning is therefore more suitable to model construction than one that does not Ashbys homeostat Shannons information theory and the electronic rat were collaborators in constructing an interconnected network of assumptions about language teleology and human behavior3o These assumptions did not go uncontested The concept that most clearly brought them into question was reflexivity As we have seen during the Macy Conferences reflexivity was a nebulous cluster that was not ex pliCitly named as such To give the flavor of the discussions that both in voked the possibility of reflexivity and failed to coalesce into coherent theory about it we can consider the image of the maninthemiddle The image was given currency by World War II engineering technolOgies that 68  ChapTer Three aimed to improve human performance by splicing humans into feedback loops with machines The image takes center stage in the sixth conference during John Strouds analysis of an operator sandwiched between a radar tracking device on one side and an antiaircraft gun on the other The gun operator Stroud observed is surrounded on both sides by very precisely known mechanisms and the question comes up What kind of a machine have we put in the middle 31 The image as Stroud used it constructs the man as an inputoutput device Information comes in from the radar trav els through the man and goes out through the gun The man is significantly placed in the middle of the circuit where his output and his input are al ready spliced into an existing loop Were he at the end it might be neces sary to consider more complex factors such as how he was interacting with an openended and unpredictable environment The focus in Strouds pre sentation was on how information is transformed as it moves through the maninthemiddle As with the electronic rat and the homeostat the em phaSiS was on predictability and homeostatic stability Countering this view was Frank FremontSmiths insistence on the ob servers role in constructing the image of the maninthemiddle Proba bly man is never only between the two machines he pOinted out Certainly he is never only in between two machines when you are studying him because you are the other man who is making an input into the man You are studying and changing his relation to the machines by virtue of the fact that you are studying him FremontSmiths introduction of the ob server was addressed by Stroud in a revealing image that sought to convert the observerinto a maninthemiddle The human being is the most mar velous set of instruments Stroud observed but like all portable instru ment sets the human observer is noisy and erratic in operation However if these are all the instruments you have you have to work with them until something better comes along32 In Strouds remark the man is converted from an openended system into a portable instrument set The instrument may not be phYSically connected to two mechanistic terminals the image implied but this lack of tight connection only makes the splice invisible It does not negate the suture that constructs the human as an information processing machine spliced into a closed circuit that ideally should be homeostatic in its operation however noisy it is in practice FremontSmith responded You cannot pOSSibly Dr Stroud eliminate the human being Therefore what I am saying and trying to emphaSize is that with all their limitations it might be pertinent for those scientific in vestigators atthe general level who find to their horror that we have to work with human beings to make as much use as possible of the inSights avail Contesting for the Body of Information I able as to what human beings are like and how they operate33 As his switch to formal address indicates FremontSmith was upset at the recu peration of his comment back into the ideology of objectivism His com ment cuts to the heart of the objection against reflexivity Just as with MacKays model of structural information reflexivity opens the manin themiddle to psychological complexity so that he can no longer be con structed as a black box functioning as an inputoutput device The fear is that under these conditions reliable quantification becomes elusive or im possible and science slips into subjectivity which to many conferees meant that it was not real science at all Confirming traditional ideas of how sci ence should be done in a postwar atmosphere that was already clouded by the hysteria of McCarthyism homeostasis implied a return to normalcy in more than one sense The thrust of FremontSmiths observations was of course to intimate that psychological complexity was unavoidable The responses of other participants reveal that this implication was preCisely what they were most concerned to deny They especially disliked reflexive considerations that took the personal form of suggesting that their statements were not asser tions about the world but were revelations of their own internal states The primary spokesperson for this disconcerting possibility was Lawrence Kubie a psychoanalyst from the Yale University Psychiatric Clinic In cor respondence Kubie enraged other participants by interpreting their criti cisms of his theories as evidence of their subconscious resistances rather than as matters for scientific debate In his presentations he was more tact ful but the reflexive thrust of his arguments remained clear His presenta tions occupy more space in the published transcripts than those of any other participant composing about onesixth of the total Although he met with repeated skepticism among the physical scientists he continued to defend his position At the center of his explanation was the multiply encoded nature oflanguage which operated at once as an instrument that the speaker could use to communicate and as a reflexive mirror that re vealed more than the speaker knew Like MacKays theory of information Kubies psychoanalytic approach built reflexivity into the model Also like MacKays theory Kubies argument met the greatest conscious resis tance in the demand for reliable quantification Kubies ideas will serve as a springboard for looking at the role that re flexivity played in the Macy Conferences and in the lives of some partici pants after the conferences ended particularly the lives of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson and their daughter Mary Catherine Bateson Con trasting the Macy Conferences with Catherine Batesons account of a simi 70  Chapter Three lar conference held in 1968 will illustrate why the full implications of re flexivity could scarcely have been admitted during the Macy period Once the observer is made a part of the picture cracks in the frame radiate out ward until the perspectives that controlled context are fractured as irre trievably as a safetyglass windshield hit by a large rock The Macy participants were right to feel wary about reflexivity Its potential was every bit as explosive as they suspected Kubies Last Stand Lawrence Kubie had been trained as a neurophysiologist He won McCul lochs admiration for his 1930 paper suggesting that neuroses were caused by reverberating loops similar to those McCulloch later modeled in neural nets34 In midcareer Kubie converted to psychoanalysis By the time of the Macy Conferences he was affiliated with the hardline Freudianism of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute In his presentation at the sixth confer ence he laid out the fundamentals of his position Neurotic processes are dominated by unconscious motivations As goalseeking behavior these processes are ineffective because the unconscious pursues its goals in sym bolic form A man wants to feel secure and money symbolizes this security for him But when he acquires money he still does not feel secure He has acquired the symbol but lacks what the symbol represents With the gap between desire and reality yawning as widely as ever he may actually feel more rather than less anxious as he approaches his putative goal Although McCulloch thought of Kubie as an experimentalist from the beginning of the conferences Kubie resisted the reductive approach that was characteristic of McCullochs work At the first conference Kubie ex pressed uneasiness over reducing complex psychological phenomena to mechanistic models equating humans and automata At the sixth confer ence he was still resisting In Neurotic Potential and Human Adaptation he explained why he had not addressed feedback mechanisms I wanted to make clear the complexity and subtlety of the neurotic process as it is en countered clinically Without this we are constantly in danger of oversim plifying the problem so as to scale it down for mathematical treatment35 Instead of mechanistic models his formulations emphasized the reflexivity of psychological processes At the seventh conference in The Relation of Symbolic Function in Language Formation and in Neurosis he insisted on the fact that the human organism has two symboliC functions and not one One is language The other is neurosis Moreover the two functions converge into the same utterance FremontSmith drove the point home Contesting for the Body of Information  7 What Dr Kubie is really trying to say is that language is a double coding both a statement about the outside and a statement about the inside It is that doubleness which gives this consciousunconscious quality to it 36 In this view a statement intended as an observation of the external world is pierced by reflections of the speakers interior state including neurotic processes of which the speaker is not conscious If a scientist denies this is the case insisting that he or she speaks solely about external reality these objections themselves can be taken as evidence of unconscious motiva tions For experimentalists like McCulloch concerned to give an objective account of mental processes psychoanalysis was the devils plaything be cause it collapsed the distance between speaker and language turning what should be scientific debate into a tar baby that clung to them the more they tried to push it away The damage that this view of reflexive utterance could do to scientific objectivity was dramatically laid out by McCulloch in a 1953 address to the Chicago Literary Club Entitled The Past of a Delusion the speech was a fiery denunciation of Freudian psychoanalysis37 If all scientific utterance is tinged with subjectivity McCulloch felt then scientific theory must inex tricably be tied to the foibles and frailties of humans as subjective beings To show the disastrous effects that this close coupling could have on sci ence McCulloch took as his case study Freudian psychoanalysis a theory that in his view both promoted the idea of close coupling and itself insidi ously instantiated it McCulloch ripped into Freud suggesting that Freud had turned to psychoanalysis because he had wanted to make more money than he would have as a Jewish medical doctor McCulloch recounted Freuds sex life intimating that Freud put sexuality at the heart of his the ory because he was sexually frustrated himself McCulloch denounced psy choanalysts as charlatans who motivated by greed kept treating their patients as long as those patients had money to pay He sneered at the empirical evidence used by Freud and other psychoanalysts In his ironic conclusion McCulloch cautioned his audience not to try to argue with psy choanalysts All they would get for their pains he predicted were psycho analytic interpretations of their objections as evidence of their own unconscious hostilities Kubie learned of this speech from a colleague who had been in the audi ence38 Although McCulloch went out of his way to exempt Kubie from his general scorn for psychoanalysis in a 1950 letter to FremontSmith he had written Of all the psychoanalysts I know Kubie has the clearest head for theory39 the attack was too stinging not to draw a rejOinder As pat as McCulloch would have wished Kubie interpreted the speech as a sign of 72  Chapter Three McCullochs own psychological distress Speaking to a colleague Kubie noted that McCullochs vitriole may be due to an accumulation of personal frustrations of his own displaced onto analysis4o Later when he heard about McCullochs erratic behavior during a presentation at Yale he wrote to McCullochs host sending a copy of the letter to FremontSmith I am distressed by this news about Warren  in him the boundary between sickness and health has always been narrow p 137 Kubie even tried to arrange for psychoanalysts in the Boston area to meet with McCulloch on a social pretext if necessary with a view to getting him the help that Kubie thought he needed p 138 As Steve Heims observes in his account of these incidents McCulloch would have been enraged had he known about Kubies attempts at intervention McCullochs The Past of a Delusion is vivid evidence that Fremont Smiths attempts at reconciliation between psychoanalysts and physical sci entists did not succeed Kubie was well aware of the experimentalists attitudes After repeated attempts to win them over he delivered his final presentation at the ninth conference in what sounds like a state of con trolled rage He likened the supposed troublemaker psychiatrist to a naturalist reporting on the facts of human nature as observed by him By contrast he noted the physical scientists ignore complex psychological phenomena in favor of the Simplifications of an abstract model The ex perimentalist and mathematician then after their explanation whereupon the naturalist presents additional observations which confront the experi mentalist and the mathematician with an even more complex version of natural phenomena As the cycle continues these new complexities are accepted with increasing reluctance and skepticism41 In these remarks Kubie presented his version of his presentations at the Macy Conferences He merely reported on the facts whereas the others offered inadequate mechanistic explanations for them This characterization ignores of course the Freudian framework he used to interpret his colleagues be havior a framework at least as theoryladen in its observations as anything McCulloch proposed42 I think of this presentation loaded with controlled anger as if in pointcounterpoint to McCullochs extravagant display of anger in his speech of the follOwing year as Kubies last stand The resistance it de scribes and inscribes went in both directions from the psychoanalyst to the experimentalist and from the experimentalist to psychoanalyst For the ex perimentalists psychoanalYSiS strengthened the chain of association that bound refleXivity together with subjectivity for it added to the already daunting problems of quantification the unfalsifiable notion of the uncon Contesting for the Body of Information I scious It is no wonder that reHexivity came to seem for many of the partic ipants a dead end for legitimate scientific inquiry Even as one version of reHexivity fizzled out other versions were being constructed in terms that made them more productive in part because these versions avoided associating reHexivitywith the unconscious Temple Burling reading the published transcripts in 1954 wrote to McCulloch I was surprised at the jamb that the group got into at this late date over the question of  the unconscious It seems to me that is putting the cart before the horse It isnt unconscious neuro activity that is puzzling but conscious Consciousness is the great mystery43 Burlings comments point to an other way into reHexivity a way taken by a handful of participants including Heinz von Foerster Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson Though they were not necessarily opposed to psychoanalytic interpretation it was not the focus of their attention The scale on which they wanted to play their tunes did not run up and down the consciousunconscious keyboard Rather they wanted to create models that would take into account the ob servers role in constructing the system The important dichotomy for them was observersystem and the important problems were how to locate the observer inside the system and the system inside the observer Circling the Observer In 1969 near the end of his career FremontSmith wrote or rather had his secretary write to participants of the various Macy Conferences that he had organized over three decades asking for their evaluation of the inter disciplinary programs and the discussion formats The inquiry was clearly a careerclOSing move he was looking for affirmation of what he considered his lifework Some of the replies were disarmingly frank Jimmie Savage wrote about how it feltto be a young man allowed to hobnob with such a di verse group ofillustrious and brilliant people He recalled that he had fre quently found himself thinking that the emperor had no clothes but wondering ifhe could trust his own feelings He confessed Cybernetics it self seemed to me to be mostly baloney44 R W Gerard expressed similar dissatisfactions recalling being intensely frustrated by the perpetual tan gents to tangents that developed during a meeting and the rare satisfaction of intellectual closure and completion of any line of thought or argument He added You may recall that this frustration was sufficient so that I did not wish to attend later meetings45 These responses are interesting not only because they throw light on the conferences but also because they talk frankly about feelings Affect ran high Savage recalled In the 74  Chapter Three transcripts by contrast emotions enter the discussion only as objects for scientific modeling Almost never are they articulated as something the participants are experiencing The contrast between the letters and the transcripts illuminates the scientific ethos that ruled at the meetings Emo tions were considered out of bounds for several reasons all of which per haps came down to the same reason The framework of scientific inquiry had been constructed so as to ignore the observer Heinz von Foerster in his letter to FremontSmith saw the inclusion of the observer as the central issue of cybernetics 46 He noted that at the begin ning of the century with the advent of relativity theory and the Uncertainty Principle a most enigmatic object was discovered which until then was carefully excluded from all scientific discourse the observer Who is he was the question indignantly asked by those who subscribed to a sour grape strategy and seriously asked by those who felt that any science worth its name must include the subject that makes the observations at the first place There were no precedents for this inclusion he continued The whole methodology of a science that includes the observer had to be developed from scratch He generously credited FremontSmith with the idea of bringing together people rather than disciplines and thus placing relation ships at the center of the discussions although the transcripts rarely ac knowledge these relationships He also commented that FremontSmith understood that including the observer would have to be an interdisciplinary task In establishing the focus as problems of communication Fremont Smith hoped the Macy group would see that the topic required an intensive and comprehensive study of man Thus the sciences were to be unified by an overarching framework that could simultaneously explain man and the people who studied man Cybernetics was to provide that framework In March 1976 two decades after the conferences had ended Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson were sitting with Stewart Brand at Batesons kitchen table in a rare joint interview Brand asked them about the Macy Conferences They agreed that including the observer was one of the cen tral problems raised by the cybernetic paradigm Reaching for a scrap of paper Bateson sketched a diagram which Brand included in the published interview of the communication system as it was envisioned before cyber netics The drawing shows a black box with input output and feedback loops within the box The space labeled Engineer remains outside the box A second drawing represents Batesons later understanding of cyber netics Here the first black box along with the names Wiener Bateson Mead is encapsulated within a larger box In this drawing the observers are included within the system rather than looking at it from the out Contesting for the Body of Information  side The interview turned to a discussion of the dynamics that had pre vailed at the Macy Conferences Mead commented Kubie was a very im portant person at that point She added McCulloch had a grand design in his mind He got people into that conference who he then kept from talk ing Bateson continued Yes he had a design for how the shape of the con versation would run over five yearswhat had to be said before what else could be said When Brand asked what that design was Bateson an swered Who knows But Mead thought it was more or less what hap pened47 Brand wanted to know why cybernetics had run out of steam What happened he asked repeatedly His sense of the situation is confirmed by correspondence exchanged between the transcript editorsHeinz von Foerster Margaret Mead and Hans Teuberafter the tenth conference in 1953 Fremont Smith and McCulloch wanted the transcripts published just as the transcripts for the previous four conferences had been pub lished But Teuber disagreed noting that the discussions were too rambling and unfocused if published he said they would be an embar rassment Although he was the junior member of the editorial board he stood his ground He wrote to Fremont Smith sending a copy of the letter to McCulloch that if the others decided to publish over his objections he wanted his name removed from the list of editors48 As the junior member he had the most to lose the others already had established reputations McCulloch must have written a stiff note in reply for Teuber answered de fenSively He insisted that the issue was not his reputation but the quality of the transcripts From your note it is obvious that I sound stuffY to you and Walter Do tell him that I wanted to get off the list of editors not because I am worried about reputations but Simply because I cant do enough for this transcript to get it into any sort of shape The transactions of this last meet ing simply do not add to the earlier onesthey detract Granted there are a few sparks but there is not enough of the old fire lowed it to you and Frank FremontSmith to speak my mind on this matter49 Mead worked out a compromise The three speakers would publish their talks as formal papers and McCullochs summary of all the conferences would be used as an introduction No one thought of suggesting more conferences or more transcripts It was the end of an era But not the end of reflexivity Although a reflexive view of cybernetics failed to coalesce into a coherent theory during the Macy Conferences Bateson did not want to let the idea go He determined to go ahead on his own He organized a conference in July 1968 to explore how the reflexive implications of cybernetics could provide the basis for a new epistemology and he invited a group of scientists social scientists and humanists In cluded were Warren McCulloch and Gordon Pask both central players in cybernetics along with Mary Catherine Bateson known as Catherine to her father as Cap an anthropologist specializing in comparative reli gions Out of this weeklong conference came Catherines 1972 book Our awn Metaphor 50 Her account of this conference in some ways a reflection of the MacyConferences contrasts sharply with the Macytranscripts The best explanation for this difference I think is epistemological Catherine assumes that of course the observer affects what is seen so she takes care to tell her readers about her state of mind and situation at the time She re counts for example finding out that she was pregnant in the months pre ceding the conference how awed she felt by the life that whether she consciously attended to it or not continued to grow within her and her devastation when the baby was born prematurely lived for an afternoon and died Her grief was still fresh when she attended the conference and it naturally colored she feels how she interpreted what she learned there The difference between her account and the Macy transcripts does not lie in the fact that one is technical and the other anecdotal It is obviously important to Catherine to understand as clearly as possible what each pre senter is saying and she skillfully guides her reader through presentations fully as complex technical and detailed as any in the Macy transcripts Rather the difference lies in her attitude toward her material and her de termination to include as much of the context as she can She takes care to tell her readers not only what ideas were exchanged but also how the people looked and her interpretation of how they were feeling In addition to the words exchanged she includes appearance body language and emotional atmosphere At the Macy Conferences her mother Margaret Mead had repeatedly cautioned that the transcripts were a purely verbal record and therefore represented only a fraction of the communication taking place Mead wanted a much fuller record that would include pos ture gesture and intonation 51 Two decades later Catherine fulfilled that desire in her precisely crafted descriptions Here is Catherines account of Warren McCulloch Warren had bright fierce eyes and held his head dropped low between thin shoul ders He had white hair and a white beard and curious blend of glee and grief of belligerence and gentleness aaM pp 2324 When he gave a presentation Catherine strained to follow his ideas and found it odd that he was not more responsive to the needs and situations of those who were listening More than anyone else present Warren tended to use an Contesting for the Body of Information  uncompromisingly technical vocabulary referring to scientists I knew nothing of and calling on unfamiliar mathematics and neurophysiology As I listened I kept checking to see whether I was sorting out what each example was about what kind of thing he was trying to say in this inter disciplinary context where not more than two or three people could follow the substance of most of his examples OOM p 65 In her con textualized account McCullochs fierce commitment to an empirical epistemology carries with it an obvious pricea tendency toward de contextualization that made him less than effective in communicating with this audience Catherine Bateson included in her prologue Gregory Batesons docu ment that set the agenda for the conference and laid out the problems it would explore The influence of cybernetics as it had evolved during the Macy Conferences is apparent throughout Equally clear are Gregorys re visions critiques and transformations of those concepts He indicated that he wanted participants to consider three cybernetic or homeostatic sys terns the individual the society and the larger global ecosystem in which both are embedded Although consciousness would be considered as an important component in the coupling of these systems OOM p 13 epis temologically its role was limited From an enormously great plethora of mental events it chooses a few on which to focus 00 M p 16 An impor tant factor guiding this choice he hypothesized is purpose Problems arise when this purposeful selection is taken as the whole If consciousness has feedback upon the remainder of mind and if consciousness deals only with a skewed sample of the events of the total mind then there must exist a systematic ie nonrandom difference between the conscious views of self and the world and the true nature of selfand the world OOM p 16 Thus the emphasis on purpose so central to the Macy Conferences be came here not an assumed orientation but a lens that consciousness wears and that distorts what it sees Specifically this lens obscures the cybernetic nature of self and the world an obfuscation that tends to be imperceptible to consciousness OOM p16 Nowhere is the transformation that Gregory worked on the Macy Con ferences clearer than in what he considers the cybernetic nature of world and self For him cybernetics is no longer the homeostatic model of the Macy Conferences although echoes of this language still linger  Rather it has become the reflexivity of the larger box that he would sketch a decade later at his kitchen table Equally striking is the changed significance of separating a system from its surrounding context For Bateson decontex tualization is not a necessary scientific move but a systematic distortion 78  Chapter Three The inclination of the conscious mind toward purpose makes it focus on an arc of causally related events leading to a perceived goal Obliterated or for gotten is the matrix in which these arcs are embedded A truly cybernetic approach for Bateson concentrates on the couplings that bind the parts into interactive wholes The revisionist thrust of Gregorys view of cybernetics is apparent in a letter he wrote to Catherine in June 1977 a year after his interview with Stewart Brand The letter begins with Gregory remarking on how reread ing Our Own Metaphor vividly brought the conference back to his mind Then Gregory lays out the gist of his new cybernetic epistemology He starts from the premise that we never know the world as such We know only what our sensory perceptions construct for us In this sense we know nothing about the world But we know something and what we know is the end result of the internal processes we use to construct our inner world Thus we know ourselves as complex beings including processes that extend below consciousness and beyond ourselves out into the world through the inner world available to a consciousness that exists only be cause of those processes We are our epistemology is Gregorys formula tion52 Catherines phrasing is similar Each person is his own central metaphor DDM p 285 In this view the dualism between subject and object disappears for the object as a thing in itself cannot exist for us There is only the subjective inner world The world as this cybernetics con structs it is a monism Nevertheless it is not solipSistic for Gregory be lieves that the microcosm of the inner world is functional within the larger ecosystem only because it is an appropriate metaphor for the macrocosm In her concluding chapter Catherine amplifies on this view by supposing that we can understand the complexity of the outer world only because our codes for constructing the inner world are Similarly diverse and complex In this sense we are a metaphor not only for ourselves but also for the larger system in which we are embedded This leads her into a subtly nuanced analysis of couplings between inner world and outer world including the inSight that because the worlds are coupled they must in the last analysis be regarded as a Single system For Gregory McCulloch represents a Moseslike figure who could lead others to the brink of this new epistemology but was unable to enter into it himself His last speech makes a special sort of sense if you read it as spoken in that context Gregory suggests53 Catherine uses McCullochs speech to end her account of the conference and the speech is worth quot ing in detail I am by nature a warrior and wars dont make sense any more McCulloch begins DDM p 311 The recognition rings true I Contesting for the Body of Information  think of the statement in his summary of the Macy Conferences Our most notable agreement is that we have learned to know one another a bit better and to fight fair in our shirt sleeves54 For him scientific debate was a form of agonistic conflict He continues in his speech by recalling the nittygritty details of his experimental work its difficulties and funny moments Then his thoughts tum to human mortality He is an old man although he can not know it now within a year he will die Earlier in the conference he snapped says Catherine I dont particularly like people Never have Man to my mind is about the nastiest most destructive of all the animals I dont see any reason ifhe can evolve machines that can have more fun than he himself can why they shouldnt take over enslave us quite happily They might have a lot more fun Invent better games than we ever did DDM p 226 N ow at the penultimate moment of the conference of Catherines book that she will dedicate to him and of his life he confesses to mortal feelings The difficulty is that we who are not singlecell organisms cannot simply divide and pass on our programs We have to couple and there is behind this a second requirement Warren began to weep We learn  that theres a utility in death because  the world goes on changing and we cant keep up with it In have any disciples you can say this of every one of them they think for themselves DDM p 311 If Gregory Bateson thought of himself as McCullochs disciple the epi taph that McCulloch wanted for himself is certainly true in Batesons case for he both learned from his mentor and went beyond him Taking the cy berneticparadigm of McCullochs empirical epistemology and making it into our own metaphor Bateson reintroduced the reflexive dimension that McCulloch had fought so hard to exorcise when it was associated with psychoanalysis Yet Batesons reinterpretation succeeded in articulating a version of reflexivity that did not depend on a psychoanalytic entanglement of conscious and unconscious meanings in scientific statements Moreover his epistemology gave an important role to objective constraints for it in sisted that only those constructions that were compatible with reality were conducive to longterm survival And survival was very much the name of the game for Catherine and Gregory Bateson The larger issues they wanted their conference to address included the increasing degradation of the environment In looking for an epistemology that would proceed from a sense of the worlds complexity they did not give up the idea that some constructions are better than others Let me now anticipate connections between the path the Batesons fol lowed and those paths traced in subsequent chapters In breaking new con 80  Chapter Three ceptual ground Gregory Bateson drew on a famous article on the frogs vi sual cortex The article had been coauthored by several people from the Macy Conferences including Warren McCulloch Walter Pitts and Jerome Lettvin also listed as coauthor was a newcomer who did not attend the Macy Conferences Humberto Maturana55 In using this article to de velop our own metaphor Bateson went where no experimentalist could easily follow for he made speculative leaps that would take decades of ex perimental work to confirm He went into the inner world and turned it in side out so to speak so that the inner world became a metaphor for the outer world Maturana was to follow a similar yet different path He went into the inner world and insisted that it cant be turned inside out that it is a metaphor for nothing other than its own creation of itself as a system This is the theory of autopoiesis which we will discuss in chapter 6 Maturana did not identifY with cybernetics as much as Bateson did and he did not generally use that term to describe his work Nevertheless his theory took up certain problems that were left hanging after the Macy Conferences ended Like Bateson Maturana found reflexivity more promising than homeostasis Also like Bateson he both appropriated concepts from the Macy context and changed them profoundly Janet FreudFreed Like Bateson Mead and Brand sitting at a kitchen table on that March morning in 1976 I am sitting at my kitchen table in March 1996 Im look ing at the pages on which their interview is published Im particularly in trigued by a photograph that Brand included one evidently given to him by Mead or Bateson Its a large picture too large to include in one frame so it stretches across two pages The caption identifies the setting as the 1952 Macy Conferencethe ninth the conference with the last real Macy tran script for the tenth volume as noted above was not a transcript but was in stead formal papers This was the conference of Kubies last stand The photograph shows a large group of men and one woman  Margaret Mead sitting around clothcovered tables pulled into a Vshape A speaker stands at the mouth of the V the caption identifies him as Yehoshua Bar Hillel But wait That must mean the date is incorrect since BarHillel spoke at the tenth conference He wasnt present at the ninth So this pho tograph must have been taken in 1953 at the conference in which the con versation was so meandering and dilatory that it couldnt be published I wonder where the caption came from I imagine Bateson digging out the photograph and giving it to Brand while he and Mead clue Brand in on who Contesting for the Body of Information  was who as Brand scribbles down the names probably while they are all still sitting at the kitchen table Now I notice that Mead isnt the only woman in the picture Another woman sits with her back to the photographer her arms extended hands reaching out to a machine I cant quite see The caption identifies her as Janet Freud but I know this cant be right either She must be Janet Freed listed in the published transcripts as assistant to the conference program I have seen her name in the typed transcripts of the editorial meetings that followed the later conferences and I know more or less what she did She was responsible for turning these mens and a couple of womens words into type She was the one who listened to the taperecordings of the early conferences and strained to catch inaudible strange words When she sent McCulloch the typed transcript of the second Macy conference she plaintively wrote that she knew there were many many blank spaces but that Dr FremontSmith had ordered her and her staff to listen to the recordings only twice and to type what they heard56 Evidently transcrib ing the taperecordings was taking too much staff time and Fremont Smith did not want to waste his resources that wayhis resources her time The quirk of memory or handwriting that made Brand call her Janet Freud seems eerily appropriate for this was the woman who like Freuds patients had no voice in the transcripts although the transcripts have a voice that we can read only because of her She was the one who preSided over the physical transformations of signifiers as they went from tape recording to transcript to revised copy to galley to book Othersthe edi tors Teuber Mead and von Foerster the organizer FremontSmith and the chairman McCullochworried about contentbut her focus was the materiality of the processes that make sounds into words marks into books She did the best she could but the transcription took much time and she had many other things to do When she was told not to take time the tran script had more ellipses than words and she felt bad What to do She sug gested to FremontSmith that he and McCulloch insist the speakers deliver drafts of their talks ahead of time57 Then she wouldnt have to strain to listen to taperecordings that were noisy beyond endurance by to days standards She wouldnt have to guess at unfamiliar words the manu scripts of the transcripts are peppered with misspellings She learned stenotypography or perhaps arranged to hire someone else who knew it so that the words could be transcribed directly into the machine This com bined with the drafts of the presentations allowed her to come up with rea 82  Chapter Three sonable transcripts of both presentation and discussion without driving herself crazy At an editorial meeting when others suggested that it was too much work to pressure the speakers to get their drafts into the office ahead of time she spoke up The drafts were essential She defended the other woman who was lower on the totem pole than she washer staffand said that this woman could be expected to do only so much She didnt say so but surely she had herself in mind as well Janet Freeds role in the Macy group is teasingly hinted at in the tran scripts to the 1949 Editors Meeting FremontSmith depended on her to keep him on track He decided to make up a little booklet for the Macy Conference chairmen to supply them with guidelines commenting It oc curred to us in fact it was Miss Freeds suggestion   Elsewhere when he realized that he had jumped around a good deal and gotten off track he referred to the list of topics that Freed had made up for him to follow  58 When one of the men remarked that there were now thirteen Macy groups and wondered ifhis office was going to be able to do it FremontSmith must have looked at Freed for he uttered a comment that in this profes sional and overwhelmingly male meeting comes across as almost shocking in its personal nature You write and get a lovely smile Do you have any thing else you want to say at this point No she replies not elaborating Nowhere else in the Macy transcripts to my knowledge does someone simply answer No Perhaps she was embarrassed or perhaps she simply felt her position made it inappropriate for her to say more FremontSmiths remark faithfully preserved by the transcription tech nologies that Janet Freed oversaw has a slightly odd phrasing and I puzzle over it She writes and gets a smile as if she had to go somewhere to fetch it as if it were produced elsewhere and transported back to her face I feel I dont know where the smile comes from because Janet Freed effaces her self Rarely do we see her directly we glimpse her largely through her re flections in the speech of others More than anyone else she qualifies as the outside observer who watches a system that she constructs through the marks she makes on paper although the system itself has a great deal of trouble including her within the names of those people who are authorized to speak and make meaning What are we to make ofJ anet F this sign of the repressed this Freudian slip of a female who with a flick of a u the U shaped table at which she sits goes from Freed to Freud Freud to Freed Thinking of her I am re minded of Dorothy Smiths suggestion that men of a certain class are prone to decontextualization and reification because they are in a position to com mand the labors of others59 Take a letter Miss Freed he says Miss Contesting for the Body of Information I Freed comes in She gets a lovely smile The man speaks and she writes on her stenography pad or perhaps on her stenography typewriter The man leaves He has a plane to catch a meeting to attend When he returns the letter is on his desk awaiting his signature From his point of view what has happened He speaks giving commands or dictating words and things happen A woman comes in marks are inscribed onto paper letters appear conferences are arranged books are published Taken out of context his words fly by themselves into books The full burden of the labor that makes these things happen is for him only an abstraction a resource di verted from other possible uses because he is not the one performing the labor Miss Freed has no such illusions Embedded in context she knows that words never make things happen by themselvesor rather that the only things they can make happen are other abstractions like getting married or opening meetings They cant put marks onto paper They cant get letters in the mail They cant bring twentyfive people together at the right time and in the right place atthe Beekman Hotel in New York City where white tablecloths and black chalkboards await them For that material and em bodied processes must be usedprocesses that exist never in isolation but always in contexts where the relevant boundaries are permeable nego tiable instantiated On a level beyond words beyond theories and equations in her body and her arms and her fingers and her aching back Janet Freed knows that information is never disembodied that messages dont flow by themselves and that epistemology isnt a word floating through the thin thin air until it is connected up with incorporating practices  c h a p  e r  FO  Uf LIBERAL SUBJECTIVITY IMPERILED NORBERT WIENER AND CYBERNETIC ANXIETY Of all the implications that firstwave cybernetics conveyed perhaps none was more disturbing and potentially revolutionary than the idea that the boundaries of the human subject are constructed rather than given Con ceptualizing control communication and information as an integrated system cybernetics radically changed how boundaries were conceived Gregory Bateson brought the point home when he puzzled his graduate students with a question koanlike in its simplicity asking if a blind mans cane is part of the man 1 The question aimed to spark a mindshift Most of his students thought that human boundaries are naturally defined byepi dermal surfaces Seen from the cybernetic perspective coalescing into awareness during and after World War II however cybernetic systems are constituted by Hows of information In this viewpoint cane and man join in a Single system for the cane funnels to the man essential information about his environment The same is true of a hearing aid for a deaf person a voice synthesizer for someone with impaired speech and a helmet with a voice activated firing control for a fighter pilot This list is meant to be seductive for over the space of a comma it moves from modifications intended to compensate for deficiencies to inter ventions designed to enhance normal functioning Once this splice is passed establishing conceptual limits to the process becomes difficult In A Manifesto for Cyborgs Donna Haraway wrote about the potential of the cyborg to disrupt traditional categories 2 Fusing cybernetic device and biolOgical organism the cyborg violates the humanmachine distinction replacing cognition with neural feedback it challenges the humananimal difference explaining the behavior of thermostats and people through the ories of feedback hierarchical structure and control it erases the ani matelinanimate distinction In addition to arousing anxiety the cyborg can Liberal SubjecTiviTy Imperiled  also spark erotic fascination witness the female cyborg in Blade Runner The flip side of the cyborgs violation of boundaries is what Haraway calls its pleasurably tight coupling between parts that are not supposed to touch Mingling erotically charged violations with potent new fusions the cyborg becomes the stage on which are performed contestations about the body boundaries that have often marked class ethnic and cultural differences Especially when it operates in the realm of the Imaginary rather than through actual physical operations which act as a reality check on fantasies about cyborgism cybernetics intimates that body boundaries are up for grabs As George Lakoff and Mark Johnson have shown in their study of em bodied metaphors our images of our bodies their limitations and possi bilities openings and selfcontainments inform how we envision the intellectual territories we stake out and occupy 3 When the body is revealed as a constmct subject to radical change and redefinition bodies of know 1 edge are similarly apt to be seen as constmcts no more inevitable than the organic form that images them At the same time that cybernetics was re configuring the body as an informational system it was also presenting itself as a science of information that would remap intellectual terrains Branching out into diSCiplines as different as biology psychology and elec trical engineering it claimed to be a universal solvent that would dissolve traditional disCiplinary boundaries4 Norbeli Wiener the father of cyber netics could be supposed to endorse this imperialist ambition Yet con templating the penetration of cybernetics into social and humanistic fields he found himself confronted with some disturbing questions Where should the cybernetic dissolution of boundaries stop At what point does the anxiety provoked by dissolution overcome the ecstasy His writings tes tify to both the exhilaration and the uneasiness that cybernetics generated when its boundary dismptions threatened to get out of hand They illus trate the complex dynamiCS that marked the constmction of the cyborg during the foundational period of the late 1940s and 1950s As this brief summary suggests to engage Wieners work is to be stmck by contradiction Envisioning powerful new ways to equate humans and machines he also spoke up strongly for liberal humanist values A talk given to an audience of physiCians in 1954 illustrates the breadth of his concern and ambivalence  5 He predicted the existence of the automatic factory ar gued that electronic computers were thinking machines capable of taking over many human deCiSionmaking processes and cautioned that humans must not let machines become their masters As I indicated in chapter 1 the values ofliberal humanisma coherent rational self the right of that 86  Chapter Four self to autonomy and freedom and a sense of agency linked with a belief in enlightened selfinterestdeeply inform Wieners thinking Often these values stand him in good stead for example when he rejected the practice oflobotomy at a time when Lawrence Kubie along with many others was endorsing it During World War II he frantically immersed himself in militaryfunded research but after the war he announced his opposition to nuclear weapons and from then on refused to do military research6 The tension between Wieners humanistic values and the cybernetic viewpoint is everywhere apparent in his writing On the one hand he used cybernet ics to create more effective killing machines as Peter Galison has noted7 applying cybernetics to selfcorrecting radar tuning automated antiair craft fire torpedoes and guided missiles Yet he also struggled to envision the cybernetic machine in the image of a humanistic self Placed alongside his human brother sisters rarely enter this picture the cybernetic ma chine was to be deSigned so that it did not threaten the autonomous self regulating subject of liberal humanism On the contrary it was to extend that self into the realm of the machine But the confluence of cybernetics with liberal humanism was not to run so smoothly The parallel between selfregulating machinery and liberal humanism has a history that stretches back into the eighteenth century as Otto Mayr demonstrates in AuthOrity Liberty and Automatic Machinery in Early Modem Europe 8 Mayr argues that ideas about selfregulation were instrumental in effecting a shift from the centralized authoritarian control that characterized European political philosophy during the six teenth and seventeenth centuries especially in England France and Ger many to the Enlightenment philosophies of democracy decentralized control and liberal selfregulation Because systems were envisioned as selfregulating they could be left to work on their ownfrom the Invisible Hand of Adam Smiths selfregulating market to the political philosophy of enlightened selfinterest These visions of selfregulating economic and political systems produced a complementary notion of the liberal self as an autonomous selfregulating subject By the midtwentieth century liberal humanism selfregulating machinery and possessive individualism had come together in an uneasy alliance that at once helped to create the cyborg and also undermined the foundations ofliberal subjectivity Philip K Dick tapped into this potential instability when he used his fiction to pose a dis turbing question should a cybernetic machine sufficiently powerful in its selfregulating processes to become fully conscious and rational be al lowed to own itself9 If owning oneself was a constitutive premise for lib eral humanism the cyborg complicated that premise by its figuring of a Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  markets The inconsistencies in liberal philosophy that Dicks fiction exposes are also apparent in Wieners texts His writing indulges in many of the prac tices that have given liberalism a bad name among cultural critics the ten dency to use the plural to give voice to a privileged few while presuming to speak for everyone the masking of deep stmctural inequalities byenfran chiSing some while others remain excluded and the complicity of the speaker in capitalist imperialism a complicity that his rhetorical practices are deSigned to veil or obscure The closest that Wiener comes to a critique of these complicities is a rigid machine he constmcts in opposition to the cybernetic machine This alien and alienating machine is invested with qualities he wants to purge from cybernetics including rigidity oppres sion militaristic regulation of thought and action reduction of humans to antlike elements manipulation betrayal and death The scope of the cri tique is limited for it distances the negative values away from his projects instead of recognizing his complicity with them When he predicted the au tomatic factory for example he foresaw that it would result in largescale economic displacements with all the implications that this would have for workingclass people as autonomous independent agents but he offered no remedy other than the platitude that men must not let machines take over 10 Wiener was not unaware of the ironies through which cybernetics would imperil the very liberal humanist subject whose origins are enmeshed with selfregulating machinery Throughout his mature writings he stmggled to reconcile the tradition of liberalism with the new cybernetic paradigm he was in the process of creating When I think of him I imagine him labOring mightily to constmct the mirror of the cyborg He stands proudly before this product of his reflection urging us to look into it so that we can see our selves as controlcommunication devices differing in no substantial regard from our mechanical siblings Then he happens to glance over his shoulder sees himself as a cyborg and makes a horrified withdrawal What assump tions underlie this intense ambivalence What threads bind them together into something we might call a worldview How are the ambivalences ne gotiated and when do they become so intense that the only way to resolve them is to withdraw What can these complex negotiations tell us about the pleasures and dangers of the posthuman subjectivity that would soon dis place the liberal humanist self To explore these questions we will begin with Wieners early work on probability In his view it is because the world is fundamentally probabilis 88  Chapter Four tic that control is needed for the path of future events cannot be accurately predicted By the same token control cannot be static or centralized for then it would not be able to cope with unexpected developments The ne cessity for a flexible selfregulating system of control based on feedback from the system itself starts with the system thumbing its nose at N ewton ian predictability From this we will follow a web of sticky connections a reinscription of homeostasis an information construction that grows out of Wieners deep belief in a probabilistic universe an interpretation of noise linking noise with entropy degradation and death and above all an ana logical mode of thinking that moves eaSily across boundaries to identifY or construct pattern similarities between very different kinds of structures As much as anything it was these analogical moves that helped to construct the cyborg as Wiener envisioned it All this from a man so uncomfortable with his own body that he could not throw horseshoes in even approxi mately the right direction and had to abandon a career in biology because he was too clumsy to do the lab work These physical characteristics are not I shall argue entirely irrelevant to the cybernetic viewpoint that Wiener was instrumental in forging Of Molecules and Men Cybernetics and Probability Like Venus cybernetics was born from the froth of chaos Wieners impor tant early work was done on Brownian motion the random motion that molecules make as they collide with each other bounce off each other and collide again as if they were manic bumper cars 11 Given this chaos it is im possible to know the microstates in enough detail to predict from the laws of motion how individual molecules will behave Therefore probabilistic and statistical methods are required The Uncertainty Principle intro duced additional complications of a profound nature by setting limits on how precisely positions and momenta can be known Probability calcula tions are facilitated if one assumes that the chaotic motion is homogeneous that is that it is the same regardless of how the system is sliced to analyze it This leads to the famous ergodic hypothesis an ensemble of dynamiC sys tems in some way traces in the course of time a distribution of parameters which is identical with the distribution of parameters of all systems at a given time12 FollOwing George David Birkhoff Wiener helped to make this hypothesis more limited precise and mathematically rigorous than had Willard Gibbs when he first conceived the idea Refining Gibbss methods and ideas Wiener saw Gibbs as a seminal fig ure not only for his own work but for all of twentiethcentury science It Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  is  Gibbs rather than Einstein or Heisenberg or Planck to whom we must attribute the first great revolution of twentieth century physics Wiener wrote in The Human Use of Human Beings 13 Gibbs deserved this honor Wiener believed because he realized the deeper implications of probabil ity theory One explanation for this uncertainty is the limit placed on knowl edge by the Uncertainty PrinCiple mentioned above In addition to reflecting our ignorance of microstates uncertainty also stems from our finitude as human beings Thirty years before this became an important el ement in chaos theory Wiener shrewdly realized that initial conditions can never be known exactly because physical measurements are never com pletely preCise What we have to say about a machine or other dynamiC system really concerns not what we must expect when the initial positions and momenta are given with perfect accuracy which never occurs but what we are to expect when they are given with attainable accuracy HU p 8 Related to these epistemological issues is the shift of orientation implicit in Gibbss approach Rather than use probabilistic methods to address large numbers of particles like the bumper cars Gibbs used probability to consider how different initial velocities and positions might cause a system to evolve in different ways Thus he considered not many sets within one world but many worlds generated from a Single set or in Wieners phrase all the worlds which are possible answers to a limited set of questions con cerning our environment So important did Wiener consider this perspec tive that he argued It is with this point of view at its core that the new science of CybernetiCS began its development HU p 12 To see why Wiener considered the innovation profound we have only to compare it with Laplaces famous boast that given the initial conditions a being with enough computing power would be able to predict a systems evolution for eternity In this view the universe is completely deterministic and know able as preCise and predictable as a clock made by Godor amounting to the same thing for Laplace a clock governed by Newtons laws of motion By contrast the probabilistic world of Gibbs and Wiener operates like a baggy pair of pants holding together all right but constantly rearranging it self every time one tries to sit down Already steeped in probability theory and inclined to view the world as one evolution realized from a range of possible worlds Wiener thought about information in the same terms Working more or less independently of Leon Brillouin and Claude Shannon he came to similar conclusions 14 As we saw in chapter 3 Wiener defined information as a function of proba bilities representing a choice of one message from a range of possible mes 90  Chapter Four sages that might be sent In a sense he took Gibbss idea and substituted word for world Instead of one world coming into being from among a galaxy of possible worlds one message comes into being from a cacophony of possible messages When the theory worked Wiener took it as further confirmation that Gibbss approach expressed something fundamental about reality the word and the world are both essentially probabilistic in their natures This interpretation though fascinating as a window into Wieners view of the relation between information and physical reality se riously understates the constructive aspect of information theory Far from being a passive confirmation information theory was an active extension of a probabilistic worldview into the new and powerfully synthetic realm of communication theory We can now understand on a deeper level Wieners view of cybernetics as a universal theory of knowledge Such a universal perspective would succeed he thought because it reflects the way that weas finite imperfect creaturesknow the universe Statistical and quantum mechanics deal with uncertainty on the microscale communica tion reflects and embodies it on the macroscale Envisioning relations on the macroscale as acts of communication was thus tantamount to extending the reach of probability into the social world of agents and actors For us in the late age of information it may seem obvious that commu nication should be understood as requiring control and that control should be construed as a form of communication Underlying this construction however is a complex series of events with its own seriated history of engi neering problems material forms and bureaucratic structuresa history that James Beniger has written about so well in The Control Revolution Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society15 In broad outline the forms of control moved from mechanical a cam direct ing a mechanical rod to follow a certain path to thermodynamic a gover nor directing the action of a heat engine to informational cybernetic mechanisms of all kinds from computers to the hypothalamus understood in cybernetic terms In mechanical exchanges determinism and pre dictability loom large When the center of interest turns to the furnace with its fiery enactments of Brownian motion probability necessarily en ters the picture 16 When information comes to the fore probability moves from being ignorance of microstates to becoming a fundamental attribute of the communication act As each new form of exchange came to the fore the older ones did not disappear An automobile is essentially aheat engine but it nevertheless continues to use levers and rods of the kind known since the classical era Similarly a computer is an information machine but it also uses molecular processes governed by the laws of thermodynamics The Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  by a shift in the nature of their control mechanisms which in tum are de termined by the kinds of exchanges the machine is understood to transact The move toward cybernetic control theory is itself driven by feedback loops between theory and artifact research and researcher Envisioning different kinds of exchanges demanded different kinds of control mecha nisms and constructing new control mechanisms facilitated the con struction of more exchanges in that modeP The circularity among experimenter control mechanism and system interface is part of the story I want to tell This story includes not only the mechanisms of cybernetic systems but also the mindsets of those who constructed themselves and their machines in a cybernetic image Wieners assumptions as we have seen were rooted in a probabilistic worldview He realized that one of the subtle implications of this view is that messages are constituted measured and communicated not as thingsinthemselves but as relational differ ences between elements in a field Communication is about relation not essence Across the range of Wieners writing the rhetorical trope that figures most importantly is analogy Understanding communication as relation suggests a deeper reading of this figure Analogy is not merely an ornament of language but is a powerful conceptual mode that constitutes meaning through relation Seen in this way analogy is a crucial operator in every thing from Wieners passion for mathematics to his advocacy of black box engineering and behaviorist philosophy Indeed cybernetics as a diScipline could not have been created without analogy When analogy is used to con stitute agents in cybernetic discourse it makes an end run around ques tions of essence for objects are constructed through their relations to other objects Writing in the years immediately preceding and following World War II Wiener antiCipated some aspects of poststructuralist theories He questioned whether humans animals and machines have any essential qualities that exist in themselves apart from the web of relations that con stituted them in discursive and communicative fields Whatever view we have of the realities underlying our introspections and experiments and mathematical truths is quite secondary any proposition which cannot be translated into a statement concerning the observable is nugatory he wrote in 1936 in The Role of the Observer18 Wiener also saw sense per ception as working through analogy In his most extreme pronouncement on the matter he asserted Physics itself is merely a coherent way of de scribing the readings of physical instruments a statement deeply regret ted by his mathematical biographer Pesi Masani 19 Among the mappings in his view of the worldasanalogy were metaphors that overlaid mathe matics onto emotion sense perception onto communication and ma chines onto biological organisms These mappings throw a different light on his attempts to reconcile cybernetics with a liberal humanist subject If meaning is constituted through relation then juxtaposing men and ma chines goes beyond bringing two preexisting objects into harmonious rela tion Rather the analogical relation constitutes both terms through the process of articulating their relationship To see this meaningmaking in process let us tum now to a consideration of analogy in Wieners texts and practices Crossing Boundaries Everything Is an Analogy Including This Statement In his autobiography I Am a Mathematician Wiener tells of retreating to the family farm for a weekend after a row with a couple of inRuential Har vard mathematicians Coming home cold and wet he fell ill and slipped into delirium All through the pneumonia he wrote my delirium as sumed the form of a peculiar depression and worry about the row and  anxiety about the logical status of my mathematical work It was impossible for me to distinguish among my pain and difficulty in breathing the Rap ping of the window curtain and certain as yet unresolved parts of the mathematical potential problem on which I was working Retrospec tively musing on how his pain merged with external stimuli and mental ab straction he arrived at a key inSight about his relation to mathematics I cannot say merely that the pain revealed itself as a mathematical tension or that the mathematical tension symbolized itself as a pain for the two were united too closely to make such a separation significant He realized the possibility that almost any experience may act as a temporary symbol for a mathematical situation which has not yet been organized and cleared up IdentifYing an unsolved scientific problem with emotional conRict and physical pain he became more and more conscious that for him mathe matics served to reduce such a discord to semipermanent and recogniz able terms Once he solved the conceptual problem its link with a personal conRict seemed to resolve that as well allOwing him to release it and pass on to something else20 Mapping mathematics onto emotional conRicts is one way then that Wiener used analogy No doubt on more complex grounds than Jacob Bronowski intended he enthusiastically en dorsed Bronowskis suggestion that all of mathematics is a metaphor Math ematics Wiener wrote in The Human Use of Human Beings which most Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  of us see as the most factual of all sciences constitutes the most colossal metaphor imaginable and must be judged aesthetically as well as intellec tually in terms of the success of this metaphor RU p 95 His identification of personal conflicts with conceptual problems was so strong that he perceived it as driving him to mathematics almost as if against his will21 The coercive imagery is significant He was the son of a domineering father who conSCiously wanted to mold him into a prodigy Once out from under his fathers tutelage he often found it difficult to mo tivate himself Steve Heims in his biography of Wiener observes that Wiener apparently used the identification between emotional states and mathematical problems as a spur to goad himself onward 22 While working on a difficult problem he would fall into a depression which he would de liberately exacerbate to make himself work harder Relying on analogical equivalencies he set up between mathematics and emotion he anticipated that solving the intellectual problem would allow him to regain psycholog ical homeostasis The flip side of drawing analogies is constructing boundaries Analogy as a figure draws its force from the boundaries it leapfrogs across Without boundaries the links created by analogy would cease to have revolutionary impact For Wiener analogy and boundary work went hand in hand In both his professional and his private life he saw boundaries playing impor tant roles He included in his first autobiography ExProdigy My Child hood and Youth an account of his mothers antiSemitism and his feeling of being unwanted and alienated from her when he discovered as a teenager that his fathers side of the family was Jewish23 Perhaps because of this formative experience the construction of insideoutside markers charac terized his response to many life situations In his autobiographies he fre quently depicted himself as an outsider standing apart from a privileged group whose boundaries did not include him He made it a point to decline scientific prizes and to resign from prestigious profeSSional groups in which he was offered membership ifhe did not agree with their goals Boundaries also played important roles in his scientific work as they do in electrical engineering generally The problem that engaged him when he fell ill and felt the flapping curtain woven into the mathematics was a boundary problem having to do with what happens to an electrical field around a sharp physical discontinuity In his later work on cybernetics boundary formation and analogical linking collaborate to create a discur sive field in which animals humans and machines can be treated as equiv alent cybernetic systems The central text displaying this interplay is the influential cybernetic manifesto that Wiener coauthored in 1943 with 94  Chapter Four Julian Bigelow and Arturo Rosenblueth Behavior Purpose and Teleol ogy24 Offering an agenda for the nascent field of cybernetics this work also created a discursive style that produced the objects of its analysis Behavior Purpose and Teleology begins by contrasting behaviorism with functionalism Whereas functionalism in the authors definition foregrounds internal structure and is relatively unconcerned with the or ganisms relation to the environment behaviorism focuses on relations be tween the organism and environment and is relatively unconcerned with internal structure In the laboratory the behaviorist approach leads to black box engineering in which one assumes that the organism is a black box whose contents are unknown Producing equivalent behavior then counts as producing an equivalent system The obvious justification is that even when little or nothing is known about internal structure meaningful conclusions can still be drawn about behavior Bracketing internal struc ture did more than this however It also produced the assertion that because humans and machines sometimes behave similarly they are es sentially alike Note the slippage in this passage comparing living organ isms and machines The methods of study for the two groups are at present similar Whether they should always be the same may depend on whether or not there are one or more qualitatively distinct unique characteristics present in one group and absent in the other Such qualitative differences have not appeared so far p 22 Appeared is an apt choice of verb for the behaviorist viewpoint was constructed precisely to elide the very real differences existing between the internal structure of organisms and that of machines The analogy is produced by how the focus of attention is con structed The authors make a similar move when they perform successive cuts in the kinds of behavior they find interesting fOCUSing for example on purposeful rather than random behavior This series of boundary forma tions they contend reveals that a uniform behavioristic analysis is applic able to both machines and living organisms regardless of the complexity of the behavior p 22 What tends to drop from Sight is the fact that the equation between organism and machine works because it is seen from a position formulated precisely so that it will work Another rhetorical move is a reinscription of two important terms pur pose and teleology Each is carefully defined to fit the cybernetiC situation Purpose implies action directed toward a goal p 18 teleology implies a goal achieved through negative feedback In terms of the offered defini tions teleological behavior means simply behavior controlled by negative feedback p 24 But keeping a loaded term like teleology in play is not an innocent reinscription It carries with it the sense of moving toward a goal Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled I meaningful to the system pursuing that goal thus implying that meaning can exist for machines It also suggests thatthe behaviorist project has a cos molOgical dimension appropriate to the sweeping vistas of time and space that teleology is usually taken to imply The authors reinforce these implications when they point out that tele ology fell into scientific disrepute because it posits a final cause that exists in time after the effects it is supposed to bring about Their version of tele ology circumvents this problem it does not rely on Aristotelian causality of any kind but only on purposeful action toward a goal They suggest that the opposite of teleology is not deterministic causality but is nonteleology that is random behavior that is not goaldirected They thus shift onto new ground the centuriesold debate between Newtonian causality and Christ ian teleology The important tension now is not between science and God but between purpose and randomness Purpose achieved through negative feedback is the way that goalseeking devices deal with a probabilistic uni verse By implication the proper cosmological backdrop for the workings of teleolOgical mechanisms is neither the cosmos infused by divine purpose as imagined by Christians nor the world of infinite predictability as dreamed by Laplace but a Gibbesian universe of probabilistic relations and entropic decay Through these reinscriptions and analogical links cyber netics becomes philosophy by other means A young philosopher Richard Taylor took up the gauntlet thrown down in the cybernetic manifesto In a critique published seven years later in the same journal Philosophy of Science he sought to show that either pur pose had been stretched so far that it could apply to any behavior or else it had been used to smuggle in inferences that referred to a machines behav ior but that had properly originated within a human observer25 He in tended to demonstrate that the rhetoric of black box engineering had covertly opened the boxes and put into them qualities produced by the very analysis that treated them as unopened black boxes In their rebuttal Wiener and Rosenblueth make clear that they are ap pealing to a discourse community of scientists whom they deem superior to philosophers They constitute this community by distinguishing be tween verbal analysis which they call trivial and barren and their analy sis which is motivated by scientific concerns26 The implicit contrast between the verbal ambiguities that might interest a philosopher and the weighty concerns of science is underscored by the contrast they draw be tween TaylorS beliefs and their repeated use of science and scientific to describe their project eleven times in a short article Taylor had used several examples to illustrate that purpose as they defined it could be ap 96  Chapter Four plied to non teleological mechanisms a clock that breaks down at midnight on New Years Eve a submarine that follows a boat to which it is attached by a cable In riposte Wiener and Rosenblueth contend that these examples are easily distinguished from true servomechanisms using negative feed back To make the point however they are necessarily led into a discussion of the internal structures of the mechanismsexactly the position they did not want to take in their original article arguing for a behaviorist approach Their rebuttal is effective then only to the extent that it complements a strict behaviorist approach with an analysis that contra behaviorist princi ples uses differences in internal structures to sort behaviors into different categories This alternating focus on behavior and internal structure is similar to the rhetorical strategies that Geof Bowker analyzes in his article shOwing how cybernetics constituted itself as a universal science27 Bowker points out that cybernetics positioned itself both as a metascience and as a tool that any other science could use It offered a trans disciplinary vocabulary that could be adapted for a variety of diSciplinary purposes presenting itself in this guise as contentfree and it Simultaneously offered a contentrich practice in which cybernetic mechanisms were analyzed modeled and oc caSionally built Operating on these two different levels cybernetic dis course was able to penetrate into other diSciplines while also maintaining its turf as a disciplinary paradigm In Wiener and Rosenblueths rebuttal to Taylor the alternation between a structurefree and a structurerich cyber netics produces a similar rhetorical effect In its structurefree guise cy bernetics links men and machines by eliding internal structure in its structurerich form it presents information flow and negative feedback as important structural elements It is no accident that Warren McCulloch used a similar rhetorical strategy in his argument with Hans Teuber as dis cussed in chapter 3 Just as the alternation between contentfree and content rich cybernetics allows a deeper penetration into diSciplinary sites than would otherwise be possible so the alternation between behavior and structure allowed the discourse Simultaneously to assimilate biolOgical or ganisms and machines into the same category and to distinguish them from plainvanilla mechanical systems In his rejOinder Taylor missed the opportunity to point out thatthe focus of Wiener and Rosenblueths analysis alternated between behavior and structure28 Instead he chose to pursue a line of questioning similar to that in his Original article as he again tried to show that if one relies only on ex ternal observations of behavior purpose cannot be reliably distinguished from chance or random events In contesting for what counts as purpose Liberal Subjecrivirlj Imperiled  he wanted to deny to the behaviorist approach a distinction crucial to gen erating their system the difference between purposeful and random be havior He sensed that behavior had been defined so as to allow intention and desire to be imputed to machines But he let slip by the larger pOintthat behaviorist assumptions were used selectively to accomplish a political agenda implicit in the way that categories were constructed For Wiener this agenda included constituting one category that encompassed cyber netic machines and humans which were put together because they shared the ability to use probabilistic methods to control randomness and another category for noncybernetic mechanical systems These boundary markers implied larger assumptions about the nature of the universe probabilistic rather than deterministic about effective strategies for dealing with this universe controlling randomness through negative feedback and about a system hierarchy that had moral connotations as well as practical values flexible systems using negative feedback were better than mechanical de vices that did not use feedback More than the definition of purpose it was these larger inscriptions that made Behavior Purpose and Teleology the founding document for cybernetics One of the most frequent criticisms made of cybernetics during this pe riod was that it was not really a new science but was merely an extended analogy men are like machines Wiener heard the charge often enough that he finally felt it was time to take the cybernetic bull by the horns In The Nature of Analogy a manuscript fragment dated 1950 he offers a strong defense for analogy moving the argument onto new and more com pelling ground 29 Its brevity notwithstanding The Nature of Analogy is a wideranging meditation on what analogy means in science mathematics language and perception It argues that those who object to Wieners ana lOgical moves do so because they hold realist assumptions that do not stand up to rigorous scrutiny CybernetiCS as Wiener envisioned it is about rela tion not essence The analOgical relations it constructs are therefore not merely rhetorical figures but are systems that generate the only kind of sig nificance available to us as perceiving finite beings with no access to un mediated reality Wiener begins by pointing out that language is always analOgical in the sense that it puts forth propositions that listeners must interpret from their own experiences which are never identical to the speakers This observa tion anticipates Michael Arbib and Mary Hesses argument that significa tion occurs through category constitution not through the communication of an Aristotelian essence3D Like them Wiener also denies that language communicates an Aristotelian essence The convergence points to similar 98  Chapter Four ities between his definition of infomwtion and Ferdinand de Saussures view of la langue or language as a system In both cases communication proceeds through selection from a field of possible alternatives rather than through the direct articulation of inherent reference Just as Saussurian lin guistics is associated with deconstructive theories that reveal the indeter minacy of reference and that expose the inability of language to ground itself so Wieners cybernetics sees communication as a probabilistic act in a probabilistic universe where initial conditions are never known exactly and where messages signify only through their relation to other messages that might have been sent For Wiener no less than Saussure signification is about relation not about the world as a thinginitself 31 It is in this context that pattern associated with information as we saw in chapter 2 assumes paramount importance Wieners view of sense per ception makes the point clear Perception does not reflect reality directly but rather relies on transformations that preserve a pattern across multiple sensory modalities and neural interfaces Representation emerges through the analogical relation of these transformations to the original stimulus In this respect sense perception is like mathematics and logic for they too deal preeminently with pattern apart from content32 The behaviorist approach is well suited to this relational epistemology because it concen trates on transmission of patterns rather than communication of essence Consider the antiaircraft predictor that Wiener developed in collaboration with Julian Bigelow during World War II33 The prognosticator received tracking data as input for example radar follOwing a plane and gave as output predictions of where the plane would go Statistical analysis was used to find patterns in these data and the data themselves were under stood as patterns analogically related to events in the world Thus percep tion mathematics and information all concentrate on pattern rather than content As data move across various kinds of interfaces analogical rela tionships are the links that allow pattern to be preserved from one modality to another Analogy is thus constituted as a universal exchange system that allows data to move across boundaries It is the lingua franca of a world re constructed through relation rather than grasped in essence Border crossings accomplished through analogy include the separation between flesh and world sense perception the transition between one dis Cipline and another for example moving from the phYSiology of living or ganisms to the electrical engineering of a cybernetic machine and the transformation of embodied experience noisy with error into the clean abstractions of mathematical pattern Even the prostheses that Wiener de Signed can be understood as operating through analogy for they trans Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  formed information from one modality into another34 The hearing glove for example was an apparatus that converted sounds auditory signals into touch tactile signals by stimulating a deaf persons fingers with electro magnetic vibrators that were analogical transformations of sound frequen cies For Wiener analogy was communication and communication was analogy Objecting that cybernetics is merely an analogy was for him akin to saying that cybernetics is merely about how we know the world The problem with this approach lies not so much in the analogical rela tions that Wiener constructed between living and mechanical systems as in his tendency to erase from view the very real differences in embodied ma teriality differences that the analogies did not express Confronted with two situations he was much more inclined to move easily and quickly to an abstract level where similarities in patterns became evident than to re main attentive to the particularities that made each situation unique No doubt his own lack of involvement in the nittygritty work of the lab was a contributing factor in this elision of embodied materiality He noted the impatience he felt with the exacting procedures of the biologicallabo ratory This impatience was largely the result of my mental quickness and physical slowness I could see the end to be accomplished long be fore I could labor through the manipulative stages that were to bring me there35 The problem was serious enough to force him to give up his hope of earning a PhD in biology In his later profeSSional collaborations with Rosenblueth and others he left the lab work to them Colleagues recall how he would wander into Rosenblueths laboratory when an experiment was under way make a few  Chapter Four As we have seen Wiener wanted to inscribe cybernetics into a larger drama that would reinforce the liberal humanist subject Given his inclina tion toward a Gibbesian universe that drama focused on probability In addition to operating on the microscale of subatomic particles and the macroscale of cybernetic circuits probability also operates on the cosmo lOgical level of universal dissipation and decay Linking probability with in formation allowed Wiener to script the cybernetic subject into a cosmological drama of chaos and order It is here on this cosmological level that he staged the moral distinctions between good cybernetic sys tems which reinforce the autonomous liberal subject and evil machines which undermine or destroy the autonomy of the subject An important player in this titanic struggle between good and evil machines is entropy a protean concept with a richly complex history Entropy as Cultural Relay From Heat Engines to Information We can begin our investigation into entropy with the series of transforma tions that Mark Seltzer traces in Bodies and Machines Seltzer concentrating on the social formations oflatenineteenthcentury naturalism finds at the heart of naturalism a double and seemingly contradictory thrust on the one hand the insistence on the materiality or physicality of persons represen tations and actions on the other hand the insistent abstraction of persons bodies and motions to models numbers maps charts and diagrammatic representations Calling the ideology that resulted from this double thrust a dematerialized materialism Seltzer instances such phenomena as the emergence of statistical representations for human behavior and the re newed interest in the ergonomics of the human body38 One focuses on be havior abstracted into statistical ensembles of data the other on the material processes of energy consumption and dissipation They illustrate the con struction of bodies both as material objects and as probability distributions The duality that Seltzer locates in nineteenthcentury culture continued into the twentieth century with renewed force when statistical thermody namics merged with information theory One of the principal sites for this merger was cybernetics The emphasis on pattern constructed bodies as im material flows of information the alternating emphasis on structure rec ognized that these black boxes were heavy with materiality Complex couplings between the two registers worked to set up a series of exchanges between biological organisms and machines To see how these couplings evolved let us start with the exchanges that thermodynamiCS set up and fol low them forward into cybernetiCS Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled I The first law of thermodynamics stating that energy is neither created nor destroyed points to a world in which no energy is lost The second law stating that entropy always tends to increase in a closed system forecasts a universe that is constantly winding down This tension between the first and second laws between stability and degradation runs like a leitmotiv through turnofthecenturycultural formations According to Seltzer the tension itself acts like a thermodynamic exchanger allOwing incompatible terms such as production and reproduction machines and bodies to be ar ticulated together The body is like a heat engine because it cycles energy into different forms and degrades it in the process the body is not like a heat engine because it can use energy to repair itself and to reproduce In one sense the comparison constructs the difference between body and ma chine in another sense it acts as an exchanger that allows bodies and heat engines to be linked together Through such comparisons Seltzer argues what is gradually elaborated is a more or less efficient more or less effec tive system of transformations and relays between opposed and contra dictory registers These ambiguous linkages were reinforced because thermodynamics itself was perceived as operating in the two different reg isters of conservation and dissipation Thus he concludes that thermody namics wrapping both conservative stability and dissipative decay within the mantle of scientific authority provided a working model of a new me chanics and biomechanics of power 39 Already functioning as an exchange system within the culture ther modynamiCS evolved into dematerialized materialism when Ludwig Boltzmann gave entropy a much more general formulation by defining it as a probability function In this dematerialized construction entropy was interpreted as a measure of randomness The second law was then refor mulated to state that closed systems tend to move from order to random ness Encompassing the earlier definition of entropy Boltzmanns formulation also added something new for it allowed entropy to be linked with systems that had nothing to do with heat engines This dematerialization was carried further when entropy was connected with information As early as 1929 the connection was made through Leo Szilards interpretation of Maxwells Demon4o a mythical being in a thought experiment proposed by James Clerk Maxwell in 1871 The De mon gained energy by sorting molecules Szilard and Leon Brillouin among others pointed out that to sort molecules the Demon has to have information about them41 The container in which the Demon sits is imagined as a black body a technical term meaning that the radiation is uniformly dispersed so that there is no way for the Demon to see the 102  Chapter Four molecules Brillouin calculated that the energy the Demon would have to expend to get information about the molecules is greater than what the Demon could gain by the sorting process The immediate result was to res cue the second law which in any case was too wellestablished to be seri ously in doubt The more important implication was to suggest that entropy and information are inversely related to each other The more information there is the less entropy the more entropy is present the less information Brillouin therefore proposed that information be considered as negative entropy or negentropy Maxwells Demon was one of the relay points through which a relationship was established between entropy and infor mation Like Brillouin and many others of his generation Wiener accepted the idea that entropy was the opposite of information The inverse relation made sense to him because he thought of information as allied with struc ture and viewed entropy as associated with randomness dissipation and death As entropy increases he wrote the universe and all closed sys tems in the universe tend naturally to deteriorate and lose their distinc tiveness to move from the least to the most probable state from a state of organization and differentiation in which distinctions and forms exist to a state of chaos and sameness In Gibbs universe order is least probable chaos most probable In this view life is an island of negentropy amid a sea of disorder There are local enclaves whose direction seems opposed to that of the universe at large and in which there is a limited and temporary tendency for organization to increase Life finds its home in some of these enclaves HU p 12 In a related metaphor he envisioned a living organ ism as an informational system swimming upstream against the entropic tide This view of entropy makes sense when viewed in the context of nineteenthcentury thermodynamics But it is not a necessary implication of information as information is technically defined Claude Shannon took the opposite view and identified information and entropy rather than op posed them42 Since the choice of sign was conventional this formulation was also a possibility HeUristically Shannons choice was explained by say ing that the more unexpected or random a message is the more informa tion it conveys43 This change in sign did not affect the dematerialization that entropy had undergone but it did reverse entropys value in more than a mathematical sense In retrospect identifYing entropy with information can be seen as a crucial crossing point for this allowed entropy to be recon ceptualized as the thermodynamic motor driving systems to selforganiza tion rather than as the heat engine driving the world to universal heat death Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled I Space will not permit me to tell the story of this reversal here and in any event it has been chronicled elsewhere44 Suffice it to say that as a result chaos went from being associated with dissipation in the Victorian sense of dissolute living and reckless waste to being associated with diSSipation in a newly positive sense of increasing complexity and new life Wiener came close to making this crossing In one of his astonishing ana lOgical leaps he saw a connection between the light that the Demon needs to sort the molecules and the lights that plants use in photosynthesis He argued that in photosynthesis plants act as if their leaves were studded with Maxwells Demons all sorting molecules to allow the plant to run up hill toward increasing complexity rather than downhill toward death 45 But he did not go beyond this isolated insight to the larger realization that large entropy production could drive systems to increasing complexity Finally he remains on the negative side of this divide seeing life and homeostasis as contrarian islands that although they may hold out for a while must even tually be swamped by the entropic tide So firmly rooted is Wiener in this perspective that he comes close on sev eral occasions to saying that entropic decay is evil Entropy becomes morally negative for Wiener when he sees it operating against the differen tial probability distributions on which the transfer of information depends Recall that Gregory Bateson defined information as a difference that makes a difference if there is no difference there is no information Since entropy tends always to increase it will eventually result in a universe in which all distributions are in their most probable state and in which univer sal homogeneity prevails Imagine Dr Zhivago sitting at his desk in a cold cold room trying to telegraph a message to his beloved Laura while in the background Lauras theme plays and entropy keeps relentlessly increasing Icicles hanging from his fingers and the telegraph key he tries to tap out I love you but he is having trouble He not only is freezing from heat death but also is styn1ied by information death No matter what he taps the mes sage always comes outthe same eeeeeee orwhatever letter is most com mon in the Russian alphabet This whimsical scenario illustrates why Wiener associated entropy with oppression rigidity and death Communi cation can be seen he suggested as a game that two humans or machines play against noise46 To be rigid is inevitably to lose the game for rigidity consigns the players to the mechanical repetition of messages that can only erode over time as noise intervenes Only if creative play is allowed if the mechanism can adapt freely to changing messages can homeostasis be maintained even temporarily in the face of constant entropic pressure to ward degradation 04  Chapter Four In the dematerialized materialism of the battlefield where life strug gles against entropy and noise the body ceases to be regarded primarily as a material object and instead is seen as an informational pattern The struggle then is between strategists who try to preserve this pattern intact and noisy opponents or rather noise as an opponent who try to disrupt it During the 1940s and 1950s Wiener was one of the important voices casting the cos mological drama between cybernetic mechanisms and noise in these terms In The Human Use of Human Beings he suggests that human beings are not so much bone and blood nerve and synapse as they are patterns of organi zation He points out that over the course of a lifetime the cells composing a human being change many times over Identity cannot therefore consist in physical continuity Our tissues change as we live the food we eat and the air we breathe become flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone and the mo mentary elements of our flesh and bone pass out of our body every day with our excreta We are but whirlpools in a river of everflowing water We are not stuff that abides but patterns that perpetuate themselves HU p 96 Consequently to understand humans one needs to understand how the patterns of information they embody are created organized stored and re trieved Once these mechanisms are understood they can be used to create cybernetic machines If memory in humans is the transfer of informational patterns from the environment to the brain machines can be built to effect the same kind of transfer Even emotions may be achievable for machines if feelings are considered not as merely a useless epiphenomenon of nervous actions HU p 72 but as control mechanisms governing learning47 Con sidered as informational patterns cybernetic machines and men can make common cause against the disruptive forces of noise and entropy The picture that emerges from these conjectures shows the cybernetic organismhuman or mechanicalresponding flexibly to changing situa tions learning from the past freely adapting its behavior to meet new cir cumstances and succeeding in preserving homeostatic stability in the midst of even radically altered environments Nimbleness is an essential weapon in this struggle for to repeat mindlessly and mechanically is in evitably to let noise win Noise has the best chance against rote repetition where it goes to work at once to introduce randomness But a system that already behaves unpredictably cannot be so easily subverted If a Gibbe sian universe implies eventual information death it also implies a universe in which the best shot for success lies in flexible and probabilistic behavior The Greek root for cybernetics steersman aptly describes the cyber netic manmachine light on its feet sensitive to change a being that both is a flow and knows how to go with the flow Liberal Subjectivitl Imperiled I distinctions Wiener makes between good and bad machines When ma chines are evil in The Human Use of Human Beings it is usually because they have become rigid and inflexible Whereas the cybernetic machine is ranged alongside man as his brother and peer metaphors that cluster around the rigid machine depict it through tropes of domination and en gulfment The ultimate horror is for the rigid machine to absorb the human being coopting the flexibility that is the human birthright When human atoms are knit into an organization in which they are used not in their full right as responsible human beings but as cogs and levers and rods it mat ters little that their raw material is flesh and blood What is used as an ele mentinamachine is in fact an element in the machine HU p185 Here the analogical mapping between humans and machines turns sinister trap ping humans within inflexible walls that rob them of their autonomy The passage shows how important it is to Wiener to construct the boundaries of the cybernetic machine so that it reinforces rather than threatens the au tonomous self When the boundaries tum ri6rid or engulf humans so that they lose their agency the machine ceases to be cybernetic and becomes Simply and oppressively mechanical The cosmological stage upon which the struggle between oppressive machines and cybernetic systems unfolds isno surprisethe Gibbesian universe in which probability reigns supreme The great weakness of the machinethe weakness that saves us so far from being dominated by it is that it cannot yet take into account the vast range of probability that char acterizes the human situation Here the probability differentials that make communication possible are assimilated to humans and good ma chines leaving bad machines to flounder around in probabilities too di verse for them to assess The rules of the contest are laid down by the second law of thermodynamics which allows a margin in which cybernetic menmachines can operate because it is still cranking up its death engine The dominance of the machine presupposes a society in the last stages of increasing entropy where probability is negligible and where the statistical differences among individuals are nil Fortunately we have not yet reached such a state HU p 181 When in the end the universe ceases to manifest diverse probabilities and becomes a uniform soup control communica tion cyberneticsnot to mention lifewill expire In the meantime men and cybernetic machines stand shoulder to shoulder in building dikes that temporarily stave off the entropic tide The boundary work that links cybernetic machines and humans perhaps between Augustinian and Manichean opponents At issue in this distinc tion is the difference between an opponent who plays honorably that is abiding by rules that do not change and one who tries to win by manipu lation For Wiener the exemplar of an Augustinian opponent is nature N a tureincluding noisemay sometimes frustrate the scientists attempt to control it but it does not consciously try to manipulate its opponent The exemplar of the Manichean opponent is the chess player including chess playing machines Unlike nature the chess player acts deviously and if possible manipulatively When the chess player is contrasted with the sci entist it is almost always to the chess playerS detriment In pointing out that nature does not try to outwit the scientist Wiener observes that having an Augustinian opponent means that the scientist has time to reHect on and correct his or her strategy because no one is trying to take advantage of the scientists mistakes Scientists are thus governed by their best moments whereas chess players are governed by their worst HU p 36 Peter Galison in The Ontology of the Enemy Norbert Wiener and the Cybernetic Vision argues that cybernetics along with game theory and operations research should be called a Manichean science48 In a fine grained analysis of Wieners collaboration with Julian Bigelow to develop an antiaircraft AA weapon during World War II Galison brilliantly shows that Wieners construction of the enemy was significantly different from that portrayed in war propaganda or even in other technical reports Rather than seeing the enemy in conventionally human or in the case of propa ganda subhuman terms Wiener modeled the enemyfor example a fighter pilot trying to evade AA fireas a probabilistic system that could ef fectively be countered using cybernetic modeling Unlike other fire sys tems which had fixed rules derived from probabilistic modeling Wieners imagined firing machine could evolve new rules based on prior observa tionthat is it could learn Thus the firing system would evolve to become as Manichean as the enemy it faced Galison argues that this strategy en abled a series of substitutions and identifications that mapped the enemy pilot onto the servocontroller and ultimately onto the allied war personnel behind the servocontroller In a Summary Report for Demonstration Wiener and Bigelow wrote We realized that the randomness or irregu larity of an airplanes path is introduced by the pilot that in attempting to force his dynamic craft to execute a useful manoeuvere  the pilot be haves like a servomechanism quoted in Galison p 236 Thus cybernet ics itself constituted through analogies creates further analogies through Liberal Subiectivity Imperiled  07 theories and artifacts that splice man to machine German to American Through this relay system the enemy becomes like us and we become like the enemy enemy mine If these analogical mappings kept the enemy pilot from being demonized they also made the cybernetic machine and byex tension cybernetics itself party to a bloody struggle in which Manichean tactics were used by both sides to kill as many humans as pOSSible Partly in reaction to this cooptation of cybernetics by the military Wiener half a decade after the war wrote the Significantly entitled The Hu man Use of Human Beings 49 Although Wiener had done everything in his power during the war to further cybernetics as a Manichean science his writings after the war show a deep aversion to the manipulation that a Manichean strategy implies From his autobiographies it is clear that he was hypersensitive to being manipulated perhaps with good reason When he was first beginning to establish himself as a mathematician his father tried to get him to use his contacts to advance his fathers philological ideasan instance of manipulation that made Wiener increasingly wary of how others might try to use his talents and influence to further their owu ends It is no accident that he associated the manipulative chessplaying machine with the military projects that he resolutely turned away from af ter atomic bombs vaporized hundreds of thousands ofJapanese civilians Remarking on Claude Shannons suggestion that chessplaying machines have military potential he wrote When Mr Shannon speaks of the devel opment of military tactics he is not talking moonshine but is discussing a most imminent and dangerous contingency HU p 178 The problem of course was that cybernetics adapted all too readily to Manichean tactics making it possible to play these deadly games even more effectively Vieners war work combined with his antimilitary stance after the war illustrates with startling clarity how cybernetics functioned as a source of both intense pride and intense anxiety for him This tension often ex pressed as an anxious desire to limit the scope of cybernetics takes a differ ent but related form when he considers the question of body boundaries always a highly charged issue When the physical boundaries of the human form are secure he celebrates the flow of information through the organ ism All this changes however when the boundaries cease to define an au tonomous self either through manipulation or engulfment In the next section we vill see how this anxiety erupts into his 1948 book Cybernetics at critical pOints causing him to withdraw from the more subversive impli cations of the diSCipline he fathered It is no accident that erotic metaphors are used to carry the thrust of the argument Like cybernetics eroticism is intensely concerned with the problematics of body boundaries It is not for nothing that sexual orgasm is called the little death or that writers from Marquis de Sade to J G Ballard have obsessively associated eroticism with penetrating and opening the body At stake in the erotically charged dis course in which Wiener considers the pleasures and dangers of coupling between parts that are not supposed to touch is how extensively the body of the subject may be penetrated or even dissolved by cybernetics as a body of knowledge It is here as much as anywhere else that Wieners concern to preserve the liberal subject comes into uneasy tension with his equally strong desire to advance the cause of cybernetics As we shall see resolu tion can be achieved only by withdrawal pointing toward a future in which the cybernetic subject could not finally be contained within the assump tions ofliberal humanism The Argument for Celibacy Preserving the Boundaries of the Subject In Cybernetics the technical text from which The Human Use of Human Beings was adapted Wiener looks into the mirror of the cyborg but then withdraws50 The scenarios he constructs to enact and justifY this with drawal suggestively point to the role that erotic anxiety plays in cybernetic narratives In my analYSiS I will focus on the chapter entitled Information Language and Society Here Wiener entertains the possibility that cyber netics has provided a way of thinking so fertile that it will allow the social and natural sciences to be synthesized into one great field ofinquiry Yet he finally demurs from this palpable object of desire Given that he is as impe rialistic as most other scientists who think they have invented a new para digm why does he prefer to maintain the intellectual celibacy of his discovery I will argue that central to his decision is a fantasy scene that ex presses and controls anxiety by reconstituting boundaries This fantasy gives rise to a series of erotically encoded metaphors that appear whenever anxiety becomes acute The metaphors also have literal meanings that re veal how intermingled the physical remains with the conceptual the erotic with the cybernetic As gestures of separation disconcertingly transform into couplings the cybernetics of the subject and the subject of cybernetics interpenetrate Wiener works up to the fantasy by pointing out that there are many or ganizations whose parts are themselves small organizations Hobbess Leviathan is a ManState made up of men a Portuguese manofwar is composed of polyps that mirror it in miniature a man is an organism made Liberal Subjectivity Imperiled  up of cells that in some respects also function like organisms This line of thought leads Wiener to ask how these bodies politic function Obvi ously the secret is in the intercommunication of its members The flow of information is thus introduced as a principle explaining how organization occurs across multiple hierarchical levels To illustrate he instances the sexually attractive substances that various species secrete to ensure that the sexes will be brought together HU p 156 For example the phero mones that guide insect reproduction are general and omnidirectional act ing in this respect like hormones secreted within the body The analogy suggests that external hormones organize internal hormones so that a hu man organism becomes in effect a sort of permeable membrane through which hormonal information flows At this point we encounter his first de murral I do not care to pronounce an opinion on this matter he an nounces rather pretentiously after introducing it preferring to leave it as an interesting idea HU p 157 I think that the idea is left because it is disturbing as well as speculative It implies that personal identity and autonomous will are merely illusions that mask the cybernetic reality If our body surfaces are membranes through which information flows who are we Are we the cells that re spond to the stimuli Are we the larger collectives whose actions are the re sultant of the individual members Or are we the host organisms who as Richard Dawkins later claimed using cybernetic arguments engage in sex because we are controlled by selfish genes within51 The choice of ex amples foregrounds sexuality but this is a kind of sex without sexuality Im plying the deconstruction of the autonomous self as a locus of erotic pleasure it circumvents the assenting demurring intenSifYing delaying and consummating that constitute sexual play When Wiener is confronted with this sexless sex his first impulse is to withdraw coitus interruptus His second impulse is to reconstruct himself as a liberal subject through a disguised erotic fantasy that allows him to control the flow of information rather than be controlled by it Similar fantasies appear everywhere in American literature from Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook to Ishmael and Queequeg They are ubiquitous because they are about the American values of masculine autonomy and control about deferred intimacy be tween men in a society that is homophobic racist and misogynist What is this fantasy What else but for the American male to imagine himself alone in the woods with an intelligent savage giving himself over to the pursuits that men follow when they are alone together HU p 157 The fantasys ostensible purpose is to show that Wiener and his savage companion could achieve intimacy even if they did not touch and shared no  Chapter Four language Wiener imagines himselfalert to those moments when the sav age shows the signs of emotion or interest noticing at these moments what he watches After a time the savage would learn to reciprocate by picking out the moments of my special active attention thus creating between them a language as varied in possibilities as the range of impres sions that the two of us are able to encompass HU p 157 Alone together in the woods the two men construct a world of objects through the inter play of their gazes In the process they also reconstitute themselves as autonomous subjects who achieve intimacy through their voyeuristic par ticipation in each others emotion and special active attention There re mains of course a necessary difference between them Wiener can move from this fantasy to the rest of his argument whereas the intelligent sav age reappears in his discourse only when Wiener finds it convenient to in voke the savage The passage reveals in miniature how the use of the plural by the liberal humanist subject can appropriate the voices of subaltern oth ers who if they could speak for themselves might say something very dif ferent Having reassured himself of intimacy autonomy and control Wiener returns to the problem of the body politic concentrating on its alarming lack of homeostasis In contrast to the regulated orderly exchanges be tween him and his savage friend the body politic is dominated by ex changes between knaves and fools with betrayal turncoatism and deception the order of the day HU p 59 The economy of this society is clearcut the fools desire the knaves manipulate their desires The econ omy is reinforced by statisticians SOciolOgists and economists who prosti tute themselves by figuring out for the knaves exactly how the calculus of desire can be maximized The only respite from this relentless manipula tion is found in small autonomous populations There homeostasis can still work whether in highly literate communities  or villages of primitive savages HU p 160 The reappearance of the savage here is Significant for anxiety about the manipulation of desire is reaching its height No doubt this reappearance has a soothing effect on Wieners imagination for it re minds him that he need not be manipulated after all We come now to the crux of the argument The danger of cybernetics from Wieners point of view is that it can potentially annihilate the liberal subject as the locus of control On the microscale the individual is merely the container for still smaller units within units that dictate actions and de sires on the macroscale these desires make the individual into a fool to be manipulated by knaves Under a cybernetic paradigm these two scales of organization would be joined to each other What chance then for intimate Liberal Subjecriviry Imperiled  11 communication alone with an intelligent savage in the woods No despite the hopes which some  friends have built for the social efficacy of what ever new ways of thinking this book may contain Wiener finds himself unable to attribute too much value to this type of wishful thinking HU p 162 Ironically expanded too far across the bodies of disciplines the science of control might rob its progenitor of the very control that was no doubt for him one of its most attractive features Having reached this conclusion Wiener reenacts the anxiety that gave rise to it Through a series of interactive metaphors that connect his fantasy with his anxiety he claims that it is a misunderstanding of the nature of all scientific achievement to suppose that the physical and social sciences can be jOined HU p 162 They must be kept apart for they permit dif ferent degrees of coupling between the scientist and the object of his inter est The precise sciences achieve a suffiCiently loose coupling with the phenomena we are studying to allow us 1 to give a massive total account of this coupling Erotic interest is not altogether lacking for the coupling may not be loose enough for us to be able to ignore it altogether HU p 163 Nevertheless the restrained science that Wiener practices is dif ferent from the social sciences where the coupling is much tighter and more intense The contrast shows how central the concept of the autono mous self is to cybernetics as Wiener envisioned it The savage makes one last appearance in Wieners anxious considera tion of how tightly the scientist can be coupled with his object without los ing his objectivity To illustrate the dangers of tight coupling Wiener observes that primitive societies are very often changed by the anthropolo gists who observe them He makes the point specifically in terms of lan guage Many a missionary has fixed his own misunderstandings of a primitive language as law eternal in the process of reducing it to writing HU p 63 In implicit contrast to this violation is the pristine intimacy Wiener achieved with his savage where no misunderstandings disrupted the perfect sympathy of their gazes Concluding that we are too much in tune iith the objects of our inves tigations to be good probes Wiener counsels that cybernetics had best be left to the physical sciences for to carry it into the human sciences would only build exaggerated expectations HU p 164 Behind this conclusion is the prospect of an interpenetration so complete that it would link the lit tle units within to the larger social units without thereby reducing the indi vidual to a connective membrane with no control over desires and with no ability to derive pleasure from them Not only sex but the sex organs them selves disappear in this construction Thus Wiener decides that however might be cybernetics is better off remaining celibate The conjunction of erotic anxiety and intellectual speculation in Wieners text implies that cybernetics cannot be adequately understood simply as a theoretic and technological extension of information theory The analogies so important to his thought are constituted not only through similarities between abstract forms such as probability ratios and statisti cal analysis but also through the complex lifeworld of embedded physical ity that natural language expresses and evokes through its metaphoric resonances Natural language is not extraneous to understanding the full complexities of Wieners thinking as his mathematical biographer Pesi Masani implies when Masani contrasts the disembodied abstractions of mathematics with the longwinded verbosity of natural language the hallmark of bureaucratic chicanery and fake labor52 On the contrary the embodied metaphors oflanguage are crucial to understanding the ways in which Wieners construction of the cybernetic body and the body of cyber netics both privilege and imperil the autonomous humanistic subject Viewed in historical perspective Wiener was not successful in contain ing cybernetics within the circle ofliberal humanist assumptions Only for a relatively brief period in the late 1940s and 1950s could the dynamic ten sion between cybernetics and the liberal subject be maintaineduneasy and anxious as that accommodation often was for Wiener By the 1960s the link between liberal humanism and selfregulation a link forged in the eighteenth century was already stretched thin by the 1980s it was largely broken It is to Wieners credit that he tried to craft a version of cybernetics that would enhance rather than subvert human freedom But no person even the father of a discipline can singlehandedly control what cybernet ics signifies when it propagates through the culture by all manner of promiscuous couplings Even as cybernetics lost the momentum of its drive to be a universal science its enabling premises were mutating and re producing at other sites The voices that speak the cyborg do not speak as one and the stories they tell are very different from the narratives that Wiener struggled to authorize FROM HYPHEN TO SPLICE CYBERNETIC SYNTAX IN LIMBO In Bernard Wolfes Limbo the 1952 novel that has become an under ground classic anxiety about boundaries becomes acute Like Norbert Wiener by whom he was deeply influenced Wolfe recognized the revolu tionarypotential of cybernetics to reconfigure bodies Also like Wiener he tried unsuccessfully to contain that potential fearing that if it went too far it could threaten the autonomy of the male liberal subject Abrasive outra geous transgressive frustratingly misogynistic and occasionally brilliant Limbo rarely leaves its readers feeling neutral David Samuelson ranks it with Brave New World and 1984 as one of the three great dystopian novels of the centuryl At the other end of the spectrum are readers including some of my students who see it as remarkable mostly for its egregious sex ism and tendentious argument Whatever ones view of Limbos literary value it is clear that the text is powerfully marked by the tum to a postWorld War II cybernetic economy of information and simulacra Limbo arrived at a pivotal moment in US history at a time when changes in speed and communication were forcing technologies of control into a reorganization that would result in the computer revolution and when the cold war loomed large in the national consciousness It was in this climate that cybernetics was beginning to change what counted as hu man As we saw in preceding chapters cybernetics constructed humans as information processing systems whose boundaries are determined by the flow of information Cybernetics problematized body boundaries at the same time that the culture was generally anxious about communist pene trations into the body politic The time was right for a text that would over lay the cybernetic reconfiguration of the human body onto the US geopolitical body and given Wolfes misogynistic views onto the contested terrain of the gendered body Limbo creates that imaginary geography and  Chapter Five imbues it with the hypnagogic force of a nightmare As a novel of ideas it displays some of the passageways through which cybernetic notions began to circulate throughout US culture and connect up with contemporary political anxieties As a novel of ideas it is an important literary document because it stages encounters between literary form and bodies represented within the text The textual corpus no less than the represented world bears the imprint of the cybernetic paradigm upon its body War acknowledged and covert is the repressed trauma that threatens to erupt throughout Limbo But this is war transfigured so compounded with neocortical forays and cybernetic refashionings that the terrains on which it is fought include synapses and circuits as well as checkpoints and borders Although the novel is set in 1990 Wolfe asserts in an afterword Anybody who paints a picture of some coming year is kiddinghes only fanCying up something in the present or past not blueprinting the future All such writing is essentially satiric todaycentered not utopic tomorrow centered 2 His insistence on the novels satiric intent is a useful reminder that Limbo refracts its cybernetics concerns through the hysterical denun ciations and national delirium precipitated by the cold war In Pure War Paul Virilio argues that postmodern technologies especially global infor mation networks and supersonic transport have changed how military or ganizations conceptualize the enemy3 Whereas a countrys borders were previously presumed adequate to distinguish between citizen and alien in the postWorld War II period the distinction between inside and outside ceased to SignifY in the same way The military no longer thought of its task as protecting the body politic against an exterior enemy Rather military re From Hyphen to Splice  nological practice it

videogame arcade Terminal identity Scott Bukatman has named this condition calling it an unmistakably doubled articulation that Signals the end of traditional concepts of identity even as it points to ward the cybernetiC loop that generates a new kind of subjectivity 6 Limbo edges uneasily toward this subjectivity and then only with signif icant reservations Instead of a circuit it envisions polarities joined by a hyphen humanmachine malefemale textmarginalia The difference between hyphen and circuit lies in the tightness of the coupling recall Wieners argument about the virtues ofloose coupling and in the degree to which the hyphenated subject is transfigured after becoming a cybernetic entity Whereas the hyphen joins opposites in a metonymic tension that can be seen as maintaining the identity of each the circuit implies a more reflexive and trans formative union When the body is integrated into a cy bernetic circuit modification of the circuit will necessarily modifY con sciousness as well Connected by multiple feedback loops to the objects it designs the mind is also an object of deSign In Limbo the ideology of the hyphen is threatened by the more radical implications of the cybernetic splice Like Norbert Wiener the patron saint of Limbo Wolfe responds to this threat with anxiety To see how this anxiety both generates the text and fails to contain the subversive implications of cybernetics let us tum now to a consideration of this phantasmic narrative Limbo presents itself as the notebooks of Dr Martine a neurosurgeon who defiantly left his medical post in World War III and fled to an un charted Pacific island He finds the islanders the Mandunji tribe practic ing a primitive form oflobotomy to quiet the tonus in antisocial people7 Thus the text reinscribes the privileged status of homeostasis during the Macy period and also glances toward Wieners devastating criticism oflo botomy in the 1948 CybernetiCS and the 1950 The Human Use of Human Beings 8 Wieners interest in lobotomy is played out in a short story he 116  Chapter Five wrote entitled The Brain with which Wolfe may have been familiar Pub lished in a 1950 science fiction anthology under the transparent pseudo nym w Norbert the story was explicitly attributed by the editor to Norbert Wiener In the story a mental patients attending physician brings the patient as a guest to an intellectual dinner club for a small group of scientists 9 The dinner conversation is reminiscent of the Macy discussions During dinner the patient a victim of amnesia faints When he comes to with the help of drugs he begins to recall the trauma that caused his amnesia He remem bers that he himself was a physician and that his wife was fatally injured and his child made into a vegetable in a hitandrun accident caused by a fiendishly clever gangster called The Brain Later fate delivered the gangster into the doctors hands when he was called to perform emergency surgery on the gangster who had received a bullet wound to the head Dur ing the operation the doctor qUietly performs a lobotomy Later the gang ster is caught because he has become stupid Like the protagonist of The Brain Dr Martine in Limbo performs lo botomies for the social good rationalizing that it is better to do the surgery properly than to let people die from infections and botched jobs He uses the operations to do neuroresearch on brainfunction mapping He discov ers that no matter how deeply he cuts certain characteristics appear to be twinned One twin cannot be excised without sacrificing the other When aggression is cut out eroticism goes too when violence yields to the sur geons knife creativity also disappears Martine expands his observations into a theory of human nature Humans are essentially hyphenated crea tures he asserts creativedestructive peacefulaggressive The appear ance on the island of queer limbs men who have had their arms and legs amputated and replaced by atomicpowered plastic prostheses brings Martines philosophy of the hyphen into juxtaposition with the splice the neologistic cutting rejoining and recircuiting that makes a cybernetic organism into a cyborg On the level of plot the intrusion of the cyborgs gives Martine an excuse to leave his island family and find out how the world has shaped up in the aftermath of the war The islandmainland dichotomy is the first of a proliferating series of di visions Their production follows a characteristic pattern First the narra tive presents what appears to be a unity the island locale the human psyche which nevertheless cleaves in two mainlanders come to the is land twin impulses are located within the psyche The cleavage arouses anxiety and textual representations try to achieve unity again by undergo

irreversible so that life can proceed according to a new definition of what constitutes wholeness Vithout truncation however painful it may be the part is doomed to exist as a remainder But amputation always proves futile in the end because the truncated part splits in two again and the relentless progression continues Through delirious and savage puns the text works out the permutations of this

Propros The logic of the hyphen dictates that Propros be mirrored by Antipros who believe that cyborgism is a perversion oflmmob philosophy Antipros spend their days proselytizing for voluntary amputation using microphones hooked up to the baby baskets that are just the right size to accommodate their limb less human torsos a detail that later becomes significant Unity cleavage tnmcation and further cleavagethese are the coun ters through which geopolitical and cybernetic endocolonization are rep resented in Limbo Amputations undertaken in an effort to stop the proliferation of doubleness only drive the plot toward the next phase of the cycle for they are nostalgic attempts to recover a unity that never was  Chapter Five This much Wolfe sees clearly Less clear is the increasingly urgent issue of how the parts should be reassembled through a hyphen or through a cir cuit I suggested earlier that the cyborg subverts Martines and Wolfes theory of the hyphen for it implies that the hyphenated polarities will not be able to maintain their identity unchanged This possibility although not explicitly recognized by the narrator is already encoded into the text for the amputations intended to ensure that paCifism is irrevocable have in stead ensured that the interface between human and machine is irrevoca ble Although the Propros justify the use of prostheses by pointing out that the pros can be detached many of the changes such as permanently in stalled biosockets into which the pros are snapped have become integral parts of the organism In a larger sense the conversions have worked such farreaching changes in social and economic infrastructures that a return to a precybernetic state is not possible Whether functioning as an amputee or a prosthetiC athlete the citizen of Limbos world is spliced into cybernetic circuits that irreversibly connect his body to the truncated militaryindus trial limbo that the world has become In the circuit of metaphoric ex changes that the cyborg sets up the narrator finds it increaSingly difficult to maintain the hyphenated separations that allow Wolfe to criticize capitalist society while maintaining intact his own sexist and technological assump tions Breakdown occurs when the hyphen is no longer sufficient to keep body gender and political categories separate from one another In explOring this breakdown I will go further into Wolfes background and his relation to cybernetiCS Not one to disguise his From Hyphen to Splice  made that the human mechanism although unknown might plausibly be the same as the mechanism embodied in the model The laboratory white box is thus discursively equated with the human black box with the re sult that the human is now also a white box that is a servomechanism whose workings are known Once the correlation is made cybernetics can be used not only to correct dysfunction but also to improve normal func tioning As a result the cyborg signifies something more than a retrofitted human It points toward an improved hybrid species that has the capacity to be humanitys evolutionary successor As we saw in chapter 4 the prob lem that Wiener encountered was how to restrain this revolutionarypoten tial of cybernetics so that it would not threaten the liberal humanism that so deeply informed his thinking In Self Portrait a short story published a few months before Limbo and concerned with similar themes Wolfe shows that he understands the limitations as well as the potential of Wieners method Cybernetics is sim ply the science of building machines that will duplicate and improve on the organs and functions of the animal based on what we know about the sys tems of communication and control in the animal the narrator says But he acknowledges that everything depends on just how many of the fimc tions you want to duplicate just how much of the total organ you want to re place12 In charge of a cybernetics laboratory he decides to separate kinesthetic and neural functioning He can be reasonably sure of creating an artificial limb that moves like a real one but connecting it to the bodys sensoryneural circuits is another matter 13 His hesitation points up how speculative many of Wieners claims were More than a technology they functioned as an ideology Without mentioning Wolfe Douglas D Noble in Mental Materiel The Militarization of Learning and Intelligence in US Education argues that the cybernetiC paradigm has in fact brought about massive transformations in VS social economic and educational infrastructures as Wolfe predicted it would 14 In his view these transfor mations have been driven primarily by the V S military The cyborg Noble insists is no science fiction fantasy but an accurate image of the modern American soldier including pilots wired into intelligent cockpits ar tillery gunners connected to computerized guidance systems and infantry soldiers whose ground attacks are instantaneously broadcast on global tele vision His analysiS consistent with arguments by military strategists for neocortical warfare and with the picture that Chris Gray draws of the mil itarys interest in the cyborg15 indicates that Wieners antimilitary stance was not sufficient to prevent the marriage of war and cybernetics a union that he both feared and helped to initiate Limbo takes the leap that Self Portrait resists imagining that under the stimulus of war the machine component no longer limited to mimick ing an organic limb is hardwired into the human nervous system to form an integrated cybernetic circuit This movement toward the splice is figured in Limbo through tropes of motion Here Wolfe follows Wieners lead for most of Wieners examples concentrate on dysfunctions of movement The intention tremor provided Wiener with one of his first experimental suc cesses Through a mechanism that duplicated the behavior of an intention tremor Wiener diagnosed the problem as an inappropriate positive ampli fication of feedback and showed how it could be cured Other kinds of movement dysfunctions are Similarly diagnosed in the 1948 CybernetiCS Even phenomena not obviously associated with motor skills are figured as various kinds of motion Thinking for example is figured as movement across neural synapses and schizophrenia is represented as a feedback problem in the cognitiveneural loop Wieners emphasis on movement im plies that curing dysfunctions of movement can cure the patient of what ever ails him whether muscular neural or psychological Given this context what could be more cybernetiC than to construct war as a dysfunc tion of movement In this sense Limbo follows the line of thought that Wiener mapped out in CybernetiCS down to particular phrasings that Wolfe appropriates Because in many respects Wolfe follows Wiener so closely the departure he makes in insisting on the typographic hyphen rather than the cybernetiC splice is even more Significant In the end how ever his resistance to the splice fails to restrain the scarier implications of cybernetics much as Wieners resistance to the cybernetic penetration of boundaries failed to prevent the dissolution of the liberal humanist subject The breakdown of Wolfes hyphenation theory occurs perhaps pre dictably when the hyphen is no longer sufficient to contain the repressed violence that the cyborg unleashes uncannily so for the text operates as if Wolfe were unconsciously reenacting from Wieners war work on antiair craft devices the mapping of enemy onto self In the world of Limbo war fare has been replaced by a Superpower Olympics between the capitalist Inland Strip and the communist East Union a competition deSigned to sublimate lethal violence into healthy competition But in the 1990 Olympics as if in recognition of Wieners failure to prevent the promiscu ous coupling of cybernetiCS with military research after World War II cy borg competition neologistically slides into warfare rather than metonymically substitutes for it Athletes from both sides are volamps and they owe their victories as much to the technicians who design the prostheses as they do to their athletic abilities Traditionally the Inland From Hyphen to Splice  Strip with its superior technology has dominated the Olympics Vishinu leader of the East Union announces that this year it will be different His people are tired of the imperialist smugness of the Inland Strip and will demonstrate that they are no secondrate colonials but are superior cyber neticians The East Union cyborgs proceed to sweep the competition win ning every category For weeks before the event Vishinu has darkly hinted at the growing schism between the two countries The rare metal columbium is needed to make the prostheses on which both sides depend and the East Union al leges that the Inland Strip has been trying to hoard the worlds columbium supply At the final ceremony instead of confirming that East Union cyber neticians will share their technology with the Inland Strip as custom dictates Vishinu Signals the East Union athletes to unveil their newest prosthetic innovation artificial arms that terminate in guns According to the Wests own logiC Vishinu satirically argues the East Unions triumph in cybernetics means that it has won the right to all the worlds columbium While Martine watches incredulously on his television at a remote moun tain retreat the East Union cyborgs open fire on the reviewing stand where Inland Strip officials are seated The apparatus of war has imploded inward to join with flesh and bone As a result of this cybernetic splice war radiates from body zones outward In the last war when the EMSIAC computer mindlessly tried to return Martines plane to basewhich would have returned him to almost certain deathMartine ripped out the circuit cables and destroyed the communi cationcontrol box But now endocolonization has proceeded far enough into the human and political body so that he can no longer disable the cir cuit simply by ripping out cables Instead of fleeing to the margins he rushes toward the center returning to the capital and demanding an audi ence with Helder Vishinus western counterpart He uses as his calling card cryptic allusions to an incident that only he and Helder know about an in cident that hints at the network of anxieties that have been activated through cyborg circuitry The return of these repressed anxieties takes the form of a corpse that refusing to stay buried haunts the narrative Throughout Martines notebook reluctant alibi for his roommate Helder allowing Helder to escape prose cution for the rapemanslaughter The placement of Martines recollection of the incident and his use of it to address the political crisis hint that the body politic and the politics of the body like prostheses and trunk are spliced together in an integrated circuit Throughout the text the narratorand behind him the authorhas exhibited profound ambivalence toward women This ambivalence like so much else in Wolfes cybernetic novel is figured through tropes of motion Shortly after his arrival at the Inland Strip Martine looks down onto the balcony of the apartment below and sees a quadroamp lying on a lounge reading a book A young woman tries to arouse him sexually and begins to remove his prostheses Uninterested the young man pushes her away and resumes reading The incident illustrates how sexual politics work under Immob Prohibited from becoming volamps women have taken the ini tiative in sexual encounters They refuse to have sex with men wearing prostheses for the interface between organism and mechanism is not per fect and at moments of stress or tension the limbs are apt to careen out of control smashing whatever is in the vicinity Partnered with truncated im mobilized men women have perfected techniques that are performed in the female superior position and that give them satisfaction while requiring no motion from the men Martine gets a firsthand demonstration when Neen an artist visiting from the East Union seduces him To Martine the idea that men would be immobile during sex is obscene for he believes that the only normal sexual experience for women is a vaginal orgasm reached using the male superior position Like his Victorian antecedents Martine atavistically polices what kinds of movements are proper for women during sexual intercourse enforcing them with violence when necessary To re venge himself on Neen and assure himself that he has not been emascu lated after her clitoral orgasm he rapes her and forces her to have a vaginal orgasm which the text assures us she enjoys in spite of herself Here the rape occurs in a context where Wolfe is in control of the dynamiCS for it reflects his own deeply misogynistic views Nevertheless the narra tive keeps moving toward the moment when another rape will be recalled and when the cyborg circuitry in which the narrator is enmeshed will make authorial control much less certain On a structural level the text strives to maintain the ideological purity of male identity by constructing categOrical and hierarchical differences be tween men and women The man has a real penis the woman a shadowy surrogate that the narrator calls a phantom penis the man is active the woman passive the man has a Single orgasm of undoubted authenticity From Hyphen to Splice I whereas the womans orgasms are duplicitous as well as double The man responds to sexual aggression but the narrator insists it is the woman who initiates sexual violence even when she is raped So far the novel reads like a devils dictionary of sexist beliefs that are Neolithic even by the standards of the 1950s Yet at the same time the text also edges toward a realization that it cannot unequivocally articulate Like man and machine male and female are spliced together in a feedback circuit that makes them mutually determine each other No less than geopolitical ideology sexual ideology is subverted and reconfigured by the cybernetic paradigm Wolfes outrageously sexist views echo those of his psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler by whom he was deeply influenced16 Bergler acknowl edged that it could be difficult for some women to reach orgasm in the male superior position but he nevertheless insisted that only this position and only vaginal orgasms were normal for women The view is inscribed in Limbo where the usual as distinct from normal state for women is frigidity Martine applies the label liberally using it to describe every woman with whom he is intimate except one his island wife Ooda Frigid ity applies both to women who are too aggressive like N een and to women who find sex with Martine unsatisfYing like his first wife Irene whose con nection with N een is Signified by the rhyme connecting their names With astonishing blindness he never considers that the dysfunction might lie in him or his view of women The text strives to endorse the narrators blind ness Yet it also engenders ambiguities beyond the narrators control and perhaps beyond Wolfes The kind of cyborg that Wolfe envisions locates the cybernetic splice at the joining of appendage to trunk As the placement of the splice suggests the novels sexual politics revolve around fear of symbolic and actual castra tion manifested as extreme anxiety about issues of control and domination Wolfe described by his biographer as a small man with a large mustache and fat cigar creates in Immob a fantasy about technolOgical extensions of the male body that endow it with supernatural power 17 During the sex act however the extensions are laid aside and only a truncated body remains If the artificial limbs swell to an unnatural potency the hidden price is the withering of the limb called in US slang the third leg or the short arm The connection becomes explicit when Martine discovers that his son Tom whom he has not seen in twenty years has become an activist in the Antipro cause Tom is a quadroamp spending his days spreading the word from the baby basket that accommodates his limbless trunk When war breaks out his already truncated body is mutilated by exploding glass shards Martine finds him in the street lifts the blanket that covers his  Chapter Five trunk and sees the mark of castration as well as the wounded torso He then shoots Tom ostensibly to put him out of his misery and perhaps also to ex orcise the specter of castration he represents In more than one sense Limbo is a masculine fantasy that relates to women through mechanisms of projection It is moreover a fantasy fixated in male adolescence Wavering between infantile dependence and adult potency Immob recreates every time a man takes off his prostheses to have sex the dynamic typical of male adolescence With the pros on a vol amp is capable of feats that even pros like O J Simpson and Mike Tyson would envy With the pros off he is reduced to infantile dependence on women The unity sought in becoming a volamp is given the lie by the split he experiences within himself as a superman and a symbolically castrated infant The woman is constructed in correspondingly ambivalent waysas a willing victim to male violence a nurturing mother who infantilizes her son and a domineering sex partner all too willing to find pleasure in the mans symbolic castration The instabilities in her subject position are con sistentwith the ambiguities characteristic of male adolescence The narra tives overwritten prose penchant for puns and hostility toward women all recall a perpetually adolescent male who has learned to use what Martine calls a screen of words to compete with other men and to insulate himself from emotional involvements with women Were this all Limbo was the novel would be merely frustrating rather than frustrating and brilliant What makes it compelling is its ability to rep resent and comment on its own limitations Consider the explanation that Martine gives for why Immob has been so successful The author drops a broad hint in the baby baskets that Immob devotees adopt In a theory adapted from Berglers book on narcissism Wolfe has his narrator suggest that the narcissistic wound from which the amputations derive is the male infants separation from the mother and his outraged discovery that his body is not coextensive with the world 18 Amputation allows the man to re turn to his preOedipal state where he will have his needs cared for by at tentive and nurturing females In locating the moment of trauma before the Oedipal triangle Wolfe reenacts the same kind of move that Lacan makes in his revision of Freud Whereas Freud identified the male childs fear of castration with the moment when he sees female genitalia and con structs them as lack Wolfe following Bergler places the anxious moment considerably earlier in the series ofsplittings and separations that the in fant experiences from his primary love object the mother 19 Given this sce nario the catalyst for anxiety is not the womans lack but the ambiguity of boundaries between infant and mother The mother is the object of pro From Hyphen to Splice  jected anger for two contradictory but paradoxically reinforcing reasons When she withdraws from the infant she traumatizes him when she does not withdraw she engulfs him The question of who is responsible for the narcissistic wound and its aftermath is a matter for anxious consideration in Limboa query presupposing that the violation of boundaries is central to the formation of male subjectivity In its stagings of traumatic moments of splitting the text vacillates on its answers to the question At times it seems that the woman is appropriating the male infant into her body at other times it seems that the amputated men are willfully forcing women into nurturing roles they would rather escape In fact once male and fe male are plugged into a cybernetic circuit the question of origin becomes irrelevant Each constitutes the other In approaching this realization the text goes beyond the presuppositions that underlie its sexual politics as it gropes however tentatively toward cyborg subjectivity Crucial to this process are transformations in the textual body trans formations that reenact and represent the textual dynamiCS of Immob The textual body begins by figuring itself as Martines notebook mark ii written in the narrative present In this notebook Martine notices that Immob slogans have a disturbingly familiar ring particularly the icon of a man getting run over by a steamroller intended to symbolize technology before Immob although for the narrator and reader it precisely charac terizes Immob Only when war erupts does Martine realize why the steamroller image is eerily familiar In a notebook that he wrote two decades earlier and that he entitled mark i he used the steamroller as an ironic emblem for the war machine In the same notebook and in a simi larly ironic vein he wrote a satiric fantasy of a society in which people pre empt the atrocities of war by voluntarily cutting off their own limbs After Martine deserted and rerouted his plane to the island Helder found the notebook among Martines gear and decided to use the satire as a blue print for an actual postwar society Surrounding Martines bitter jokes with his own flatfooted selfserving commentary he ventriloquized Martines words making them speak the message he wanted not what Martine intended Martines notebook thus functions like a child whom he abandoned just as he abandoned his son Tom when he fled and who then was turned into the very thing Martine dreaded most as was Tom The present narrative is recorded in the mark ii notebook The revela tion that the Immob bible is actually Martines mis appropriated mark i notebook demonstrates that the body of the text is subject to the same kind of cleavages truncations and further cleavages that mark the bodies represented within the text 126  Chapter Five Although Martine tries to heal the split narrative by renouncing the first notebook and destroying the second the narrative continues to fragment The form this fragmentation takes is significant for it follows the geogra phy ofImmob The text splits into a trunk consisting of the main narrative and prosthetic extensions constituted through drawings that punctuate the text and lines that scrawl down the page where the trunk ends Prosthesis and trunk are connected through puns that act like cyborg circuitry spliC ing the organic body of the writing together with the prosthetic extensions that operate in a subvocal margin Pros are thus punningly and cunningly linked not only with the hyphenated Propros but also with the more dan gerous and circuitous cyborg prose the truncatedspliced noun that speaks the name of the texts body prose as well as the name of the pros theses pros attached to it and represented within it Wolfe is notthe only writer to link writing and prosthesis In Prosthesis David Wills explores connections between his fathers wooden leg and the language that the son adopted as his prosthesis of choice Trunk and pros thesis body and writing are alike in having limits and in having relations with something beyond those limits Prosthesis is the writing of my self as a limit to writing Wills explains as he interrogates the boundaries and splicings between the body of his prose and his fathers body in prose There is no simple name for a discourse that articulates with rather than issuing from the body while at the same time realizing that there is no other discoursein the sense of no other translation transfer or rela tionno other conception ofit except as itis a balancing act performed by the body a shift or transfer between the body and its exteriority20 The conHation that Wills addresses in this difficult and subtle passage is the su perimposition of a body of prose with bodies constituted within prose The passage points toward a double entanglement of the textual corpus and the physical body Writing is a way to extend the authors body into the exterior world in this sense it functions as a technological aid so intimately bound up with his thinking and neural circuits that it acts like a prosthesis At the same time the writing within itself is trying to come to terms with what it means to have a prosthesis particularly with whether the prosthesis should be incorporated into the subjects identity in which case he becomes a cy borg or should remain outside in which case the prosthesis is necessarily alien from the self and so not something one can use with the natural dex terity For Wolfe the choice cannot be made in a clearcut or unambigu ous way He can neither embrace the transformations that becoming a textual cyborg would imply nor remain content with an amputated text that has a limited range of motion So he Simultaneously crafts prosthetic exten From Hyphen to Splice  sions for the text and forbids the text to recognize them as itself Just as pros e destabilizes the concept of the natural human body so it also desta bilizes the notion of a text contained and embodied solely within its typo graphic markers Pros e implies a text spliced into a cybernetic circuit that reaches beyond the typography of the printed book into a variety of graphic and semiotic prostheses that it both authorizes and denies It is no surprise to find then that the pros e of Limbos corpus implies a dispersed subjectivity Whereas the voice that speaks from the texts trunk is clearly characterized as Martine the subject that produces and is pro duced by the prosthetic marginalia is more difficult to identity The ques tion of which voice speaks from what textual body was a complicated issue in Wolfes career To supplement his income he worked for a while as a ghostwriter for Billy Roses syndicated column Here his words issued from a body of print Signed with someone elses name He also wrote for popular science magazines including Mechanix Illustrated frequently contribut ing to articles published under someone elses byline In addition he col laborated on lowlevel popular science books One of these Plastics What Everyone Should Knott appeared under Wolfes name although it was written by someone else21 The synthetic chemical product that came of age in World War II and that Wolfe envisions as the substance of choice for prostheses thus functions as a kind of prostheSiS for his corpus extending his name through a body of print ventriloquized by someone else To explore the complex play between Martines voiced narrative and the drawings nonverbal lines and punning neologisms that serve as prosthe ses to the textual tnmk I want to consider one of the drawings in more de tail It shows a nude woman with three prosthetic legsthe Immob logoextruding from each of her nipples 22 She wears glasses carries a huge hypodermiC needle and has around her neck a series of tiny contigu ous circles which can be taken to represent the popular 1950s necklace known as a choker To the right of her figure is a grotesque and diapered male torso minus arms and legs precariously perched on a flat carriage outfitted lith Immob prosthetic legs instead of wheels He has his mouth open in a silent scream perhaps because the woman appears to be aiming the needle at him In the text immediately preceding the drawing Rose mary is mentioned Although the truncated text does not acknowledge the drawing and indeed seems unaware of its existence the proximity of Rose marys name indicates that the drawing is of her with the needle presum ably explained by her profeSSion as a nurse In a larger sense the drawing depicts the Immob woman The voiced narrative ventriloquizes her body to speak of the injustices she has inflicted 128  Chapter Five on men constructing her retrospectively as a cyborg who nourishes and emasculates cyborg sons It makes her excess signified by the needle that she brandishes and the legs that sprout from her nipples responsible for her loversons lack In this deeply misogynistic writing it is no surprise to read that woman are raped because they want to be Female excess is rep resented as stimulating and encouraging male violence and rape is poetic revenge for the violence women do to men when they are too young and helpless to protect themselves The voiced narrative strives to locate the origin of the relentless dynamiC of splitting and truncation within the fe male body According to this textual trunk the refusal of the womans body to respect decent boundaries between itself and another initiates the downward spiral into amputation and eventual holocaust Countering these narrative constructions are other interpretations au thorized by the drawings nonverbal lines puns and lapses in narrative continuity From these semiotic spaces which Julia Kristeva has associated with the feminine come inversions and disruptions of the hierarchical cat egories that the narrative uses to construct maleness and femaleness 23 Rosemary written into nonexistence by her suicide within the texts repre sented world returns in the prosthetic space of the drawing and demands to be acknowledged On multiple levels the drawing deconstructs the nar ratives gender categories In the represented world women are not al lowed to be cyborgs yet this female figure has more pros attached to her body than does any man Women rank after men in the represented world but here the womans body is on the left and is thus read before the mans Above all women and men are separate and distinct in the represented world but in this space parts of the mans body have attached themselves to her Faced with these disruptions the voiced narrative is forced to rec ognize that it does not unequivocally control the textual space The semi otic intrusions contest its totalizing claims to write the world The challenge is reflected within the narrative by internal contradictions that translate into pros e the intimations of the semiotic disruptions As the voiced narrative tries to come to grips with these contradictions it cycles closer to the realization that the hierarchical categories of male and female have imploded into the same space The lobotomies that Martine performs suggest the depth of this collapse To rid the psyche coded male in Limbo of subversive female elements it is necessary to amputate For a time the amputations work allowing male performance to be enhanced by prosthe ses that bestow new potency But eventually these must be shed and the woman encountered again Then the subvocal feminine within merges with the prostheses without initiating a new cycle of violence and ampu From Hyphen to Splice  tation No matter how deeply the cuts are made they can never excise the ambiguities that haunt and constitute these posthuman and post typographic bodies Limbo envisions cybernetics as a writing technology that inscribes over the hierarchical categories of traditional sexuality the in determinate circuitry of cyborg gender As a white male writing in the early 1950s Wolfe was aware that the pol itics of gender relations were beginning to shift Several times the narrator mentions womens liberation quarantined by quotation marks and au thorial scorn Nevertheless even he cannot escape the feminine within After ending his first notebook with a huge NO inscribed across the page the narrator ends the second notebook with an equally vehement YES which he intends as an affirmation of humankinds hyphenated na ture His mothers birth name was Noyes Noyes and he dimly senses the connection between matrilineal heritage and the affirmation he seeks But the hyphen is not the same as the splice By inscribing Noyes as Noyes he seeks to draw a line that will preserve each half of the hyphenation as a distinct entity His voiced concessions to sexual politics are Similarly limited to realiZing that women are not entirely monsters The real power relations at stake in sexist relations remain opaque to him just as do the deeper im plications of being wired into a cybernetic circuit But Limbo knows more than it can say a paradox inscribed within the text by the narrators image of a screen of words that hides something from him Throughout there are flashes ofinsight that exceed his formula tions and that are never adequately accounted for by his theOrizing The ef fect is finally of another voice trying to emerge authored not so much by Wolfe as by the cybernetic circuit he can imagine but not fully articulate Just as Martines first notebook has been ventriloquized by Helder so the narrative as a whole is ventriloquized by a constellation of forces that make it speak of a future in which hyphenation gives way to the spliced prose that both signifies and is the cyborg If the ownership of the writing with which the prostheSiS signifies is unclear the obscurity is appropriate for it indicates that control in a cybernetiC circuit is not a localized function but is an emergent property Neither entirely in control nor out of control Limbo teeters on the edge of an important recognition In one sense the bodies of Limbo are the cyborgs who populate the imaginative world of Immob In another more literal sense the body of Limbo is constituted through the typefaces that march across the page Normally readers attend to the represented world and only peripherally notice the physical body of the text When the prose of Limbo itself be comes a cyborg however the splice operates to join the imaginative world 130  Chapter Five of the signifier with the physical body of print Parallels between a texts physical form and its represented world have a long history in literature from the seventeenthcentury iconographic poems of George Herbert to the maps tattoos and body writing that litter the surfaces of Kathy Ackers contemporary novels What is distinctive about Wolfes use of the correla tion is the suggestion that the bodies in the text and the body of the text not only represent cyborgs but also together compose a cyborg in which the ne ologistic splice operates to join imaginative signification with literal physi cality In this integrated circuit the physical body of the text and the bodies represented within the text evolve together toward a posthuman post typographic future in which human and intelligent machine are spliced to gether in an integrated circuit subjectivity is dispersed vocalization is non localized bodies of print are punctuated with prostheses and boundaries of many kinds are destabilized More than a conduit through which ideas from cybernetics boiled into the wider U S culture in the 1950s Limbo is a staging of the complex dynamics between cyborg and literary bodies As such it demonstrates that neither body will remain unchanged by the en counter  Chap  ter  SIx THE SECOND WAVE OF CYBERNETICS FROM REFLEXIVITY TO SELFORGANIZATION It all started with a frog In a classic article entitled What the Frogs Eye Tells the Frogs Brain central players in the Macy groupincluding Warren McCulloch Walter Pitts and Jerry Lettvindid pioneering work on a frogs visual system They demonstrated with great elegance that the frogs visual system does not so much represent reality as construct it 1 Whats true for frogs must also hold for humans for theres no reason to be lieve that the human neural system is uniquely constructed to show the world as it really is Not everyone in the research group was interested in pursuing the potentially radical epistemological implications of this work McCulloch for example remained wedded to realist epistemology But a young neurophysiologist from Chile Humberto Maturana was also on the research team and he used it as a springboard into the unknown Pushing the envelope of traditional scientific objectivity he developed a new way of talking about life and about the observers role in describing living systems Entwined with the epistemological revolution he started are the three sto ries we have been follOwing the reification of information the cultural and technological construction of the cyborg and the transformation of the hu man into the posthuman As a result of work by Maturana and his collabo rator Francisco Varela all three stories took decisive turns during the second wave of cybernetics from 1960 to 1985 This chapter follows the paths that Maturana and Varela took as they probed deeply into what it means to acknowledge that the observer like the frog does not so much discern preexisting systems as create them through the very act of observa tion Central to the seriated changes connecting these secondwave develop ments to the first wave is the difficult and protean concept of reflexivity As we saw in chapter 3 participants in the Macy Conferences wrestled with  Chapter Six reflexivity without much success The particularities of the situationthe embedding of reflexivity within psychoanalytic discourse Kubies halito sis of the personality the unquantifiability of reflexive conceptsput a spin on reflexivity that affected its subsequent development 2 Gregory Batesons 1968 conference had made clear that the problems posed by in cluding the observer could be addressed only if a substantial reworking of realist epistemology was undertaken The intuitive leap made by Bateson in concluding that the internal world of subjective experience is a metaphor for the external world remained a flash of insight rather than a quantita tively reliable inference that experimentalists like Warren McCulloch could endorse The problem was how to make the new epistemology oper ational by integrating it with an experimental program that would replace intuition with empirical data At issue in this evolving series of events are questions crucially important to the technoscientific concepts of information the cyborg and the posthuman Like Norbert Wiener Maturana has strong ties with liberal humanism At stake for him was how to preserve the central features of autonomy and individuality while still wrenching them out of the Cartesian and Enlightenment frameworks in which they are embedded Even as he struggled mightily to say something new his work replicates some assumptions of the first wave at the same time that it radically revises oth ers3 Ve can see an early form of the struggle in the essays of Heinz von Foerster the genial and wellconnected Austrian emigre who functions as a transitional figure linking first and secondwave cybernetics From this beginning we will trace the epistemological revolution that Maturana fo mented delineate its connections with the three stories we have been fol lowing and finally explore the differing assumptions that led Varela Maturanas collaborator to set off in a new direction Reflexivity Revisited Von Foerster left Austria in 1948 after working on microwave electronics for Germany during World War II work that had important applications in radar his 1949 vita lists much of this research as secret4 In the spring of 1949 von Foerster wrote McCulloch renowned for his generosity in help ing younger men to seek his help in finding a job in North America5 McCulloch found the Austrian a position at the University of Illinois he also introduced von Foerster into the Macy group Soon afterward McCulloch and Mead asked von Foerster ifhe would serve as prinCipal ed itor of the published transcripts Although he had some misgivings because The Second Wave of Cybernetics I English was not his native language he agreed With his name emblazoned on the title pages the published transcripts are associated with him as much as with anyone It was not until the Macy Conferences had run their course however that von Foerster tried to develop more fully the epistemological implica tions ofincluding the observer as part of the system The punning title of his essay collection Observing Systems announces reHexivity as a central theme Observing is what human systems do in another sense hu man systems themselves can be observed The earliest essay On Self Organizing Systems and Their Environments taken from a presentation given in 1960 shows von Foerster thinking about reHexivity as a circular dy namic that can be used to solve the problem of solipsism How does he know other people exist he asks Because he experiences them in his imag ination His experience leads him to believe that other people similarlyex perience him in their imaginations IfI assume that I am the sole reality it turns out that I am the imagination of somebody else who in turn assumes that he is the sole reality6 In a circle of intersecting solipsisms I use my imagination to conceive of someone else and then of the imagination of that person in which I find myself reHected 7 Thus I am reassured not only of the other persons existence but of my own as well Although charmingly posed the argument is lOgically nonsensical for there is no assurance that other imaginations are conceiving of me any more than I am conceiving of them Maybe I am thinking not about von Foerster but about a Big Mac That even a Hedgling philosopher could reduce the argument to shreds is perhaps beside the point Von Foerster himself seemed to recognize that the argument was the philosophical equivalent to pulling a rabbit from a hat for he finally solves the paradoxical circling between solipsistiC imag inations by asserting what he was to prove namely the existence of reality Although the argument is far from rigorous it is interesting for the line of thought it suggests Its implications are illustrated by a cartoon drawn by Gordon Pask at von Foersters request of a man in a bowler hat in whose head is pictured another man in a bowler hat in whose head is yet another man in a bowler hat 8 The potentially infinite regress of men in bowler hats does more than create an image of the observer who observes himself by observing another It also visually distinguishes the observer as a discrete system inside the larger system of the organism In the aftermath of the Macy Conferences one of the central problems with reHexivitywas how to talk about it without falling into solipsism or resorting to psychoanalYSiS The message from the Macy Conferences was clear if reHexivity was to be credible it had to be insulated against subjectivity and presented in a context in which it had at least the potential for rigorous preferably math ematical formulation As Norbert Wiener was later to proclaim Cyber netics is nothing if it is not mathematicalg Distinguishing the observer as a system separate from the organism was one way to make reflexivity more manageable for it reduced the problem of the observer to a problem of communication among systems Throughout the 1960s von Foerster remained convinced of the impor tance of reflexivity and he experimented with various ways to formulate it A breakthrough occurred in 1969 when he invited Maturana to speak at a conference at the University ofIllinois There Maturana unveiled his ideas about treating cognition as a biological phenomenonl0 The power of Maturanas theory must have deeply affected von Foerster for his thinking about reflexivity takes a quantum leap in complexity after this date The in creased sophistication can be seen in his 1970 essay Molecular Ethology An Immodest Proposal for Semantic Clarification in which he criticizes behaviorism by making the reflexive move of turning the focus from the ob servation back onto the observer Behaviorism does not demonstrate that animals are black boxes that give predictable outputs for given inputs he argues Rather behaviorism shows the cleverness and power of the experi menter in getting animals to behave as such Instead of searching for mechanisms in the environment that tum organisms into trivial machines we have to find the mechanisms within the organisms that enable them to tum their environment into a trivial machinell Here reflexivity moves from men in bowler hats to the beginning of a powerful critique of objec tivist epistemology By 1972 von Foerster had been so thoroughly con vinced by Maturanas theory that one of the latest essays in Observing Systems  The Second Wave of Cybernetics  story discussed in chapter 5 From the wiredup brain the researchers dis covered that small objects in fast erratic motion elicited maximum re sponse whereas large slowmoving objects evoked little or no response It is easy to see how such perceptual equipment is adaptive from the frogs point of view because it allows the frog to perceive flies while ignoring other phenomena irrelevant to its interests The results implied that the frogs perceptual system does not so much register reality as construct it As the authors noted their work shows that the frogs eye speaks to the brain in a language already highly organized and interpreted instead of transmit ting some more or less accurate copy of the distribution of light upon the receptors 12 The workled Maturana to the maxim fundamental to his epis temology Everything said is said by an observer AC p xxii No wonder the article was quickly recognized as a classic for it blew a frogsized hole in realist epistemology Despite the potentially radical implications of the articles content how ever its form reinscribed conventional realist assumptions of scientific dis course The results are reported in an objectivist rhetoric that masks the fact they are interpreted through the sensory and cognitive interfaces of embodied researchers whose perceptions were at least as transformative as the frogS Years later Maturana would recall that he and Lettvin contin ued to work in an objectivist framework even as that framework was being called into question by their research In the preface to Autopoiesis and Cognition The Realization of the Living Maturana recalled When Jerry Y Lettvin and I wrote our several articles on frog vision  we did it with the implicit assumption that we were handling a clearly defined cognitive situation there was an objective absolute reality external to the animal and independent of it not determined by it which it could perceive cog nize  But even there the epistemology that guided our thinking and writing was that of an objective reality independent of the observer AC p xiv Faced with this inconsistency Maturana had a choice He could continue to work within the prevailing assumptions of scientific objectivity or he could devise a new epistemology that would construct a worldview consistent with what he thought the experimental work showed The break came with his work on color vision in other animals including birds and primates He and his coauthors not the Macy group this time found they could not map the visible world of color onto the activity of the nervous system13 There was no onetoone correlation between percep tion and the world They could however correlate activity in an animals retina with its experience of color If we think of sense receptors as consti tuting a boundary between outside and inside this implies that organiza 136  Chapter Six tionally the retina matches up with the inside not the outside From this and other studies Maturana concluded that perception is not fundamen tally representational He argued that to speak of an objectively existing world is misleading for the very idea of a world implies a realm that preex ists its construction by an observer Certainly there is something out there which for lack of a better term we can call reality But it comes into existence for us and for all living creatures only through interactive pro cesses determined solely by the organisms own organization No descrip tion of an absolute reality is possible he and Varela wrote in Autopoiesis and Cognition for such a description would require an interaction with the absolute to be described but the representation that would arise from such an interaction would necessarily be determined by the autopoietic or ganization of the observer  hence the cognitive reality that it would gen erate would unavoidably be relative to the observer AC p 121 Thus he was led to a premise fundamental to his theory living systems operate within the boundaries of an organization that closes in on itself and leaves the world on the outside With Varela Maturana developed the implications of this inSight in Autopoiesis and Cognition He arrived at his theory he explains in the in troduction by deciding to treat the activity of the nervous system as deter mined by the nervous system itself and not by the external world thus the external world would have only a triggering role in the release of the inter nallydetermined activity of the nervous system AC p xv His key in Sight was to realize that if the action of the nervous system is determined by its organization the result is a circular selfreflexive dynamiC A living sys tems organization causes certain products to be produced for example nucleic acids These products in tum produce the organization character istic of that living system To describe this circularity he coined the term autopoiesis or selfmaking It is the circularity of its organization that makes a living system a unit of interactions he and Varela wrote in Au topoiesis and Cognition and it is this circularity that it must maintain in or der to remain a living system and to retain its identity through different interactions AC p 9 Building on this premise of autopoietic closure Maturana developed a new and startlingly different account of how we know the world 14 What is this account One path into it is to regard the account as an at tempt to counteract anthropomorphic projection by clearly distinguishing between two domains of description On the one hand there is what one can say about the circularity of autopoietic processes in themselves taking care not to attribute to them anything other than what they exhibit On the The Second Wave of Cybernetics  other hand there are the inferences that observers draw when they place an autopoietic system in the context of an environment Seeing system and medium together over a period of time observers draw connections be tween cause and effect past and future But these are the observers infer ences they are not intrinsic to the autopoietic processes in themselves Lets say I see a blue jay flash through the trees and settle on the birdbath I may think Oh its getting a drink Other species for example those lack ing color vision would react to this triggering event with different con structions A frog might notice the quiCk erratic flight but be oblivious to the blue jay at rest Each living system thus constructs its environment through the domain of interactions made possible by its autopoietic or ganization What lies outside that domain does not exist for that system Maturana realizing that he was fighting a long tradition of realist assump tions deeply embedded in everyday language developed an elaborate vo cabulary as a prophylactic against having anthropomorphism creep back in The necessity of finding a new language in which to express his theory was borne home to him during the student revolution in Chile in May 1968 It was then he wrote in Autopoiesis and Cognition that he discovered that language was a trap but the whole experience was a wonderful school in which one could discover how mute deaf and blind one was  one began to listen and ones language began to change and then but only then new things could be said AC p xvi Shortly we will analyze places where Maturana like the participants in the Mac Conferences seems unable to escape from the tar baby of self reflexive language For the moment however let us explore the new things he tried to say No doubt the cumbersomemany would not hesi tate to call it torturedquality of his language will be immediately appar ent to the reader 15 Before we judge it harshly however we should remember that Maturana was attempting nothing less than to give a differ ent account of how we know the world Since it is partly through language that humans bring worlds into being for themselves he was in the impossi ble position of pulling himself up by his own bootstraps trying to articulate the new by using the only language available the lingua franca whose meanings had long ago settled along lines very different from those he was trying to envision We can start with that most problematic of constructions the observer From Maturanas point of view the fundamental cognitive operation that an observer performs is the operation of distinction AC p xxii Influ enced by C SpencerBrown Maturana and even more so Varela in his work Principles of Biological Autonomy Hi sees the operation of distinction as marking space so that an undifferentiated mass is separated into an in side and an outside or in Maturanas terminology into a unity and a medium in which the unity is embedded Unities distinguished by the ob server can be of two types simple and composite A simple unity only has the properties with which it is endowed by the operations of distinction through which it becomes separated from a background Composite uni ties by contrast have structure and organization AC p xx terms that Maturana uses in special senses and that require further explanation A composite unitys organization is the complex web of all possible rela tionships that can be realized by the autopoietic processes as they interact with one another When Maturana speaks of a systems organization he does not mean how this web of relationships might be described in abstract form Rather he intends organization to denote the relations actually in stantiated by the autopoietic unitys circular processes Structure by con trast is the particular instantiation that a composite unity enacts at a particular moment For example when a female human is born she has one kind of structure when she enters puberty she has another if she con tracts a disease she has still another But throughout her lifetime her orga nization remains the same that which is characteristic of a living human Only when death occurs does her organization change According to Maturana this ability of living organisms to conserve their autopoietic or ganization is the necessary and sufficient condition for them to count as liv ing systems All living systems are autopoietic and all physical systems if autopoietic can be said to be living AC p 82 Thus life and autopoiesis are coextensive with one another Heres how that proposition sounds in Maturanas terminology The living organization is a circular organization which secures the production or maintenance of the components that specify it in such a manner that the product of their functioning is the very same organization that produces them AC p 48 To account for a systems embeddedness in an environment Maturana uses the concept of structural coupling All living organisms must be struc turally coupled to their environments to continue living humans for ex ample have to breathe air drink water eat food AC pp xxi In addition systems may be structurally coupled to each other For example a cell within my body may be considered as a system in itself but it relies for its continued existence on its structural coupling to my body as a whole Here again the role of the observer becomes important for Maturana is careful to distinguish between the triggering effect that an event in the medium has on a system structurally coupled with it and the causal relationship that observers construct in their mind when they perceive the system interact The Second Wave of Cybernetics  ing with the environment When my bird dog sees a pigeon I may think Oh hes pointing because he sees the bird But in Maturanas terms this is an inference I draw from my position in the descriptive domain of ahu man observer AG p 121 From the viewpoint of the autopoietic pro cesses there is only the circular interplay of the processes as they continue to realize their autopoiesis always operating in the present moment and al ways producing the organization that also produces them Thus time and causality are not intrinsic to the processes themselves but are concepts in ferred by an observer The present is the time interval necessary for an in teraction to take place Maturana and Varela wrote Past future and time exist only for the observer AG p 18 Information coding and teleology are likewise inferences drawn by an observer rather than qualities intrinsic to autopoietic processes In the au topoietic account there are no messages Circulating in feedback loops nor are there even any genetic codes These are abstractions invented by the observer to explain what is seen they exist in the observers domain of in teractions rather than in autopoiesis itself The genetic and nervous sys tem are said to code information about the environment and to represent it in their functional organization This is untenable Maturana and Varela noted The genetic and nervous systems code processes that speCify series of transformations from initial states which can be decoded only through their actual implementation not deSCriptions that the observer makes of an environment which lies exclusively in his cognitive domain AG p 53 Similarly the notion of information refers to the observers degree of uncertainty in his behavior within a domain of alternatives defined by him hence the notion of information only applies vithin his cognitive domain AG p 54 The same applies to teleology A living system is not a goal directed system it is like the nervous system a stable statedetermined and strictlv deterministic svstem closed on itself and modulated by interac    tions not speCified byits conduct These modulations however are appar ent as modulations only for the observer who beholds the organism or the nervous system externally from his own conceptual descriptive perspec tive as lying in an environment and as elements in his domain of interac tions AG p 50 One implication ofletting go of causality is that systems always behave as they should which is to say they always operate in accord with their struc tures whatever those may be In Maturanas world my car always works whether it starts or not because it operates only and always in accord with its structure at the moment It is I as an observer who decides that my car is not working because it will not start Such punctuations as Maturana 40  Chapter Six and Varela call them belong to the domain of the observer AC pp 5556 Because they are extrinsic to the autopoietic processes they are also extrinsic to the biological description that Maturana aims to give of life and cognition In an important essay entitled Biology of Language Maturana remarks that the operation of a structuredetermined system is necessarily perfect that is it follows a course determined only by neigh borhood relations in its structure and by nothing else It is only in a referen tial domain such as the domain of behavior that an observer can claim that an error has occurred when his or her expectations are not fulfilled17 To assess the changes that the autopoietic view entails let us turn now to compare its account of living systems with that given by firstwave cyber netics A convenient focal point for the comparison of the two theories is liberal humanism where their implications for the construction of subjec tivitywill become apparent Having traced these implications we will then consider the impact of secondwave cybernetics on the entwined stories we have been following the reification of information the construction of the cyborg and the transformation of the human into the posthuman Reconfiguring the Liberal Humanist Subject As we saw in chapter 4 Norbert Wiener had a complex relation to the lib eral humanist subject Father of a theory that put humans and machines into the same category he was nevertheless committed to creating a cyber netics that would preserve autonomy and individuality His nightmare was the human reduced to a cog in a rigid machine lOSing the Hexibility and au tonomous functioning that Wiener regarded as the birthright of a cyber netic organism Echoes of this cybernetic tradition linger in Maturanas description of composite unities as autopoietic machines AC p 82 Fully aware of the implications of calling autopoietic systems machines Maturana makes clear that there is nothing in his theory to prohibit artificial systems from becoming autopoietic unities If living systems were machines they could be made by man he and Varela point out AC p 83 They poohpooh the idea that life cannot or should not be created by humans There seems to be an intimate fear that the awe with respect to life and the living would disappear if a living system could be not only re produced but deSigned by man This is nonsense The beauty of life is not a gift of its inaccessibility to our understanding AC p 83 When Maturana objects to firstwave projects that attributed biolOgical proper ties to machines his criticism addresses how life is defined not the idea that machines can be alive For example he criticizes John von Neumanns pro The Second Wave of Cybernetics  posal to create a selfreproducing machine by arguing that von Neumann modeled descriptions that biologists had made rather than autopoietic pro cesses in themselves Von Neumann modeled inferences about what ap peared to take place in the cell in terms of information content program and coding By modeling the processes expressed in these descriptions he produced a machine that could make another machine but he did not model the phenomena of cellular reproduction heredity and genetics as they take place in living systems18 This critique points to an important change between Maturanas posi tion and that announced by Wiener and his coauthors in their cybernetic manifesto Whereas the latter argued that it is the systems behavior that counts Maturana argues that it is the autopoietic processes generating be haviorthat count As we have seen firstwave researchers concentrated on building artifacts that would behave as cybernetic mechanisms John von Neumanns selfreproducing machines Claude Shannons electronic rat Ross Ash bys homeostat By contrast Maturana and others in the second wave look to systems instantiating processes that count as autopoietic The homeostat might behave cybernetically for example but it does not count as an autopoietic machine because it does not produce the components that produce its organization Perhaps because of this emphasis on process autopoietic theory has proven readily adaptable to the analysis of social sys tems In autopoietic theory the machine of interest is much more likely to be the state than Robocop or Terminator19 In first wave cybernetics questions of boundary formation were crucial to its constructions of subjectivity Boundary questions are also important in autopoietic theory Wieners anxieties recirculate in discussions about what happens when one autopoietic unity is encapsulated within the boundaries of a larger autopoietic unity for example when a cell functions as part of a larger machine Can the cell continue to function as an au tonomous entity or must its functioning be subordinated to the larger unity To distinguish these two cases Maturana introduces the term al lopoietic Whereas autopoietic unities have as their only goal the continu ing production of their autopoiesis allopoietic unities have as their goal something other than producing their organization When I drive my car its functioning is subordinated to the goals I set for it Instead of the pistons using their energy to repair themselves for example they use their energy to turn the drive shaft so that I can get to the store I function autopoieti cally but the car functions allopoietically We saw in chapter 4 that cybernetic boundary questions often involve deep ethical and psycholOgical issues such as those that troubled Wiener  Chapter Six when he envisioned the dissolution of the autonomous liberal subject In autopoietic theory one of the principal effects of autopoiesis is to secure for a living system the crucial qualities of autonomy and individuality Con sequently boundary issues are often played out in discussions of how much autonomy autopoietic systems will retain for themselves and how much autonomy they will demand from the systems with which they are structurally coupled The distinction between allopoietic and autopoietic gives Maturana a way to talk about power struggles within society In au topoietic theory the idea corresponding to Wieners horror at a man being forced to act as a cog in a machine is a system that is capable of autopoiesis being forced instead to function allopoietically especially for humans Maturanas ideal is a human society in which one would see all human be ings as equivalent to oneself and to love them  without demanding from them a larger surrender of individuality and autonomy than the mea sure that one is willing to accept for oneself while integrating it as an ob server AC p xxix Such a society he adds is in its essence an anarchist society a society made for and by observers that would not surrender their condition of observers as their only claim to social freedom and mutual re spect AC p xxx In such rhetoric we can eaSily hear a reinscription of liberal humanist values even though the epistemology that Maturana ad vocates is very different from that which gave rise to the Enlightenment subject Yet it would be a mistake to think that Maturanas radicalism can be so easily recuperated back into liberal subjectivity The split between his posi tion and liberal philosophy becomes obvious when questions of objectivity arise Consider for example his insistence that ethics cannot be separated from scientific inquiry Instead of accepting the proposition that the scien tist simply reports what he or she sees and in this sense remains aloof from ethical considerations Maturana envisions autopoietic theory as a way to reconnect ethics and science Emphasizing that autonomy always takes place in the context of structural coupling autopoiesis rejects the objec tivism that drives a wedge between the scientist observer and the world be ing observed For Maturana observation does not mean that the observer remains separate from what is being observed on the contrary the ob server can observe only because the observer is structurally coupled to the phenomenon she sees Expanded to social ethics this implies in man as a social being  all actions however individual as expressions of prefer ences or rejections constitutively affect the lives of other human beings and hence have ethical significance Structural coupling requires that human beings as components of a society necessarily realize their individ The Second Wave of Cybernetics  others AC p xxvi Although Maturana thus follows in the liberal tradition of cyberneti cians like Wiener in placing a high value on the autonomous individual the meaning of autonomy has undergone significant change Autonomy as Maturana envisions it is not consistent with laissezfaire capitalism it is not consistent with the idea that each person is out for himself and devil take the hindmost and it is not consistent with the ethical position that a scien tist could undertake a research program without being concerned about how the results of the research would be used In these respects the indi vidualism and autonomy that Maturana champions challenge the premises embodied in liberal subjectivity at least as much as they reinscribe those premises To explore further how liberal subjectivity is both contested and rein scribed in autopoietic theory let us tum now to Maturanas account of the observer Nowhere does Maturana depart more clearly from first wave philosophies than in his insistence that the observer must be taken into ac count The observer is a living system and any understanding of cognition as a biological phenomenon must account for the observer and his role in it AC p 48 The act of observation necessarily entails reflexivity for one of the systems that an observer can describe is the observer as an autopoietic system But reflexivity as Maturana envisions it is very different from the psychoanalytic reflexivity that Lawrence Kubie introduced into the Macy Conferences see chapter 3 In contrast to Kubies emphasiS on uncon scious symbolism Maturanas observer does not have psycholOgical depth or specificity Rather Maturanas observer is more like the observer that Albert Einstein posits in the special theory of relativity The one who sees is always called simply the observer without further speCification implying that any individual of that species occupying that position would see more or less the same thing Although the observers perceptions construct real ity rather than paSSively perceive it for Maturana this construction de pends on positionality rather than personality In autopoietic theory the opposite of objectivism is not subjectivism but relativism If the interplay between conscious and unconscious processes is not im portant for Maturana how is the observer produced The observer begins as an autopoietic unity as all living systems are said to be As a particular kind of autopoietic unity capable of becoming an observer the observer system can generate representations of its own interactions When the system recursively interacts with these representations it becomes an ob server The system can then recursively generate representations of these representations and interact with them as when an observer thinks I am an observing system observing itself observing Each twist of this reflexive spiral adds additional complexity enlarging the domain of interactions that specifY the world for that autopoietic unity Maturana and Varela summa rize the situation thus in Autopoiesis and Cognition We become ob servers through recursively generating representations of our interactions and by interacting with several representations simultaneously we gener ate relations with the representations of which we can then interact and re peat this process recursively thus remaining in a domain of interactions always larger than that of the representation A C p 14 Reflexivity is thus fundamental to Maturanas account not only because the autopoietic oper ations of a unity specify for it a world but also because the systems reflexive doubling back on its own representations generates the human subject as an observer What about consciousness Maturana seldom uses this word preferring to talk instead about thinking and selfconsciousness Thinking occurs in a statedetermined nervous system when neurophysiological processes can interact with some of its own internal states as if these were indepen dent entities This recursive circling corresponds to what we call think ing AC p 29 To get from thinking to selfconsciousness requires language according to Maturana In the same way that perception does not consist of information from the environment passing into the organism so language does not consist of someone giving information to someone else Rather when an observer uses language this acts as a trigger for the ob servers interlocutor allowing the interlocutor to establish an orientation within his or her domain of interactions similar to the orientation of the speaker Only when two entities have largely overlapping domainsfor ex ample when they are both humans sharing similar cultures and beliefsis it possible for them to achieve the illusion that communication between them has occurred From this description it is apparent that Maturana explains language by simply extending to the linguistic realm the same ideas and terminology he uses to explain perceptionan explanation that in my view fails to account for some of the distinctive features oflanguage Shortly we will have an op portunity to look critically at this view oflanguage For the moment it per mits us to understand Maturanas view of selfconsciousness Self consciousness arises when the observer through orienting linguistic behavior can orient himself towards himself and then generate communica tive descriptions that orient him toward his description of this selforienta tion The observer generates selfconsciousness then when he endlessly The Second Wave of Cybernetics  describes himself describing himself Thus discourse through communica tive description originates the apparent paradox of selfdescription self consciousness a new domain of interactions AC p 29 Because Maturana understands selfconsciousness solely in linguistic terms seeing it as an emergent phenomenon that arises from autopoietic processes when they re cursively interact with themselves consciousness for him becomes a epiphe nomenon rather than a defining characteristic of the human as an autopoietic entity The activity of cerebration represents only a fraction of the total au topoietic processes and selfconsciousness represents only a fraction of cer ebration Thus the theory implicitly assigns to consciousness a much more peripheral role than it does to autonomy and individualism In this respect autopoietic theory points toward the posthuman even as it reinscribes the au tonomy and individuality of the liberal subject The complex relation of autopoietic theory to liberal humanism be comes even more apparent when we ask how the theory attempts to es tablish a foundational ground for itself As we saw in chapter 1 liberal humanism in C B Macphersons reading of it grounds itself on the notion of possessive individualism the idea that subjects are individuals first and foremost because they own themselves The equivalent foundational premise in autopoietic theory is the idea that living systems are living be cause they instantiate organizational closure It is precisely this closure that guarantees the subject will operate as an autonomous individual But how is it that Maturana or anyone else knows that organizational closure ex ists Is the claim that autopoietic closure is intrinsically a feature ofliving systems or is it how a human observer perceives living systems including itself This question lies coiled around the brainstem of autopoietic theory layered into its evolutionary history through its founding distinctions be tween qualities intrinsic to autopoietic processes and qualities attributed to them by an observer If the theory says thatthe observer creates the system by drawing distinctions it risks undercutting the ontolOgical primacy of or ganizational closure If it says that autopoietic processes are an essential feature of reality it risks undercutting its epistemological radicalism Faced with this Scylla and Charybdis Maturana at first steered toward rel ativism and then as its dangers loomed closer changed course and steered toward the absolutism of autopoietic processes existing in reality as such So in Biology of Cognition the earlier essay in Autopoiesis and Cogni tion Maturana often wrote as if it is the observers action that distinguishes an autopoietic unity from its background or medium Although a distinc tion performed by an observer is a cognitive distinction and strictly the unity thus specified exists in his cognitive domain as a description the ob 146  Chapter Six server in his discourse specifies a metadomain of descriptions from the per spective of which he established a reference that allows him to speak as if a unity  existed as a separate entity AC p xxii emphasis added This im plies the autopoietic unity exists as a distinction that is performed by the ob server rather than as an entity that could exist in the absence of an observer However in Autopoiesis The Organization of the Living the second and later essay in Autopoiesis and Cognition Maturanaand Varela wrote as if an autopoietic unity has the ability to constitute itself independent of an ob server Autopoietic machines through their interactions and transforma tions    continuously regenerate and realize the network of processes relations that produced them in the process constituting themselves as a concrete unity in the space in which they the components exist by speci fying the topological domain of the autopoietic machines realization of such a network AC p 79 Here the operation of the autopoietic entity it selfrather than a distinction drawn by an observercreates the space in which the entity exists Even more explicit is the claim that individuality comes from the processes themselves rather than from the actions of an ob server Autopoietic machines have individuality that is by keeping their organization as an invariant through its continuous production they ac tively maintain an identity which is independent of their interactions with an observer AC p 80 It is not surprising that the issue continues to be debated in autopoietic theory for it admits of no easy solution In Maturanas desire to found au topoiesis on something more than an observers distinction we can see him trying to pull away from the tar baby of his own reflexive language Relevant for our purposes is not so much the resolution to this dilemma as if there could be a definitive resolution or even the demonstration that the the orys founding moves make it vulnerable to de constructive critique Rather the important point here is that the foundational ground for establishing the subjects autonomy and individuality has shifted from selfpossession with all of its implications for the imbrication of the liberal subject with in dustrial capitalism Instead these privileged attributes are based on orga nizational closure the system closes on itself by itself or on the reflexivity of a system recurSively operating on its own representations the observers distinctions close the system Closure and recursivity then play the foun dational role in autopoietic theory that selfpossession played in classic lib eral theory The emphaSiS on closure is visually apparent in the computer simulations called tessellation automata that Varela created to illustrate autopoietic dynamics In contrast to the artificiallife programs that will be discussed in chapter 9 the point of tessellation simulations is to find out The Second Wave of Cybernetics I 117 how boundaries close on themselves how they are maintained when inter acting with other tessellation automata and how and when boundaries break down which in autopoietic theory is equivalent to death In this de scription we see the affinity of autopoiesis not for industrial capitalism which Maturana frequently excoriates but for utopian anarchy Auton omy is important not because it serves as the paradoxical foundation for market relations but because it establishes a sphere of existence for the in dividual a location from which the subject can ideally learn to respect the boundaries that define other autopoietic entities like itself This emphasis on closure autonomy and individuality also changes what count as primary concerns When the existence of the world is tied to an observer the urgent questions revolve around how to maintain boundaries intact and still keep connection with a world that robustly continues to exist regardless of what we think about it These changes from liberal humanism also bring with them limitations that are distinctively different from those of firstwave cybernetics Whereas firstwave philosophies tended to obscure the importance of em bodiment and the observer autopoietic theory draws its strength precisely from its emphasis on these attributes Its Achilles heel by contrast is ac counting for living systems explosive potential for transformation The very closure that gives autopoietic theory its epistemological muscle also limits the theory so that it has a difficult time accounting for dynamic inter actions that are not circular in their effects A prime example in my view is the convoluted and problematic way that Maturana treats language Con sistent with his emphasis on circularity he prefers to talk not about lan guage but languaging a process whereby observers acting solely within their own domain of interactions provide the triggers that help other ob servers Similarly orient themselves within their domains Autopoietic the ory sees this exchange as a coupling between two independent entities each of which is formed only by its own ongoing autopoietic processes As this description shows the theory is constantly in danger of solipsism a danger it both acknowledges and attempts to avoid by protesting that it is not solipsistic The main reason the theory adduces for not being solipsistic is its acknowledgment of structural coupling the phrase used to denote an organisms interaction with the environment Even if we grant that this move rescues the theory from solipsism the theory still seriously under states the transformative effects that language has on human subjects We have only to recall the term that Maturana employs for a languageusing subjectthe observer to see how curiously inert and selfenclosing is his view oflanguage What drops from view in Maturanas account is the active nature oflin guistic interactions Researchers from Jean Piaget on have shown that a childs neural hardware continues to develop after birth in conjunction with the linguistic and social environment in which the child is embedded In light of this work it is misleading to talk about the process of active shaping through language simply as an entity orienting itself with the aid of an en vironmental trigger To appreciate just how active this process is we can look at instances where it has been shortcircuited and the child thus con sequently fails to develop normally In Mindblindness An Essay on Autism and Theory of Mind Simon BaronCohen argues this is what happens with autistic children20 Somehow the shaping mechanisms fail to direct neural development and as a result the child is unable to create an internal sce nario that would explain why others act as they do For such children BaronCohen argues the world of social interactions is chaotic and unpre dictable because they suffer from mindblindness an inability to imagine for others the emotions and feelings they themselves have Autopoietic theory in its zeal to construct an autonomous sphere of action for self enclosing entities formulates a deSCription that ironically describes autis tic individuals more accurately than it does normally responsive people For the autistic person the environment is indeed merely a trigger for pro cesses that close on themselves and leave the world outside In the next section we will tum to a discussion of how autopoietic theory treats evolution Like language evolution represents another area where Maturanas version of autopoietic theory fails to come to terms with the dy namic transformative nature of the interactions between living systems and their environments From there we will explore the split that develops between Maturana and Varela While Maturana continued to replicate his original formulation of the theory Varela and others became increasingly interested in changing the theory so that it could better account for dy namic interactions Keeping many of the central insights of autopoietic theory Varela added new material and reworked some assumptions in the seriated pattern ofinnovation and replication we have seen at work in other sites One effect of these changes was to allow elements of autopoietic the ory to be integrated into contemporary cognitive science and especially artificial life which will be the focus of my discussion of thirdwave cyber netics in chapter 9 At this point a summary may be useful of how autopoietic theory con tributes to our evolving stories of 1 the reification of information 2 the construction of the cyborg and 3 the transformation of the human into the posthuman First whereas firstwave cybernetics played a large role The Second Wave of Cybernetics I in divesting information of its body autopoietic theory draws attention to the fact that information so defined is an abstraction that has no basis in the physically embodied processes constituting all living entities Au topoiesis thus swerves from the trajectory traced in chapters 3 and 4 with regard to information insisting that information without a body does not exist other than as an inference drawn by an observer Second whereas firstwave cybernetics envisioned the cyborg mostly as an amalgam be tween the organic and the mechanical autopoietic theory uses its ex panded definition oflife to speculate on whether social systems are alive The paradigmatic cyborg for autopoiesis is the state not the kind of me chanical human imagined by Bernard Wolfe or Philip K Dick Third au topoietic theory preserves the autonomy and individuality characteristic ofliberal humanism but it sees thinking as a secondary effect that arises when an autopoietic entity interacts with its own representations Self consciousness a subset of thinking is relegated to a purely linguistic effect The grounding assumptions for individuality shift from selfpos session to organizational closure and the reflexivity of a system recur sively operating on its own representations A status report then informations body is still contested the empire of the cyborg is still expanding and the liberal subject although more than ever an autonomous individual is literally lOSing its mind as the seat of identity Autopoiesis and Evolution It is no accident that evolution is a sore spot for autopoietic theory for the theory was deSigned to correct what Maturana and Varela saw as an overemphasis on evolution and reproduction as the defining characteris tics oflife Over and over they argue that evolution and reproduction are logically and practically subordinate to autopoiesis Reproduction and evolution are not essential for living organisms they assert in Autopoiesis and Cognition AC p 11 They are even more opposed to defining living organisms in terms of genetic code As Varela made clear in a retrospective assessment he and Maturana were conSciously aware of wanting to pro vide an alternative account oflife an account that would not depend in any important way on the idea of a genetic code The notion of autopoiesis was proposed  with the intention of redressing what seemed to us to be a fun damental imbalance in the understanding ofliving organization In cor rectingthis imbalance they had two interrelated goals Along with creating a theory of the living that would debunk the current emphasis on DNA as the master molecule oflife they also wanted to insist on the holistic na ture ofliving systems21 Varela is willing to admit that perhaps they erred on the side of overem phasizing autopoiesis at the expense of genetics By contrast Maturana be came if anything more confirmed in his opposition as time went on Many critics including Richard Lewontin Evelyn Fox Keller Lily Kay Richard Doyle and others have commented on the distortions created in modem biology by the present overemphasis on DNA22 But few go as far as Maturana In the 1980 article Autopoiesis Reproduction Heredity and Evolution a recapitulation of autopoietic theory he wrote I claim that nucleic acids do not determine hereditary and genetic phenomena in living systems and that they are involved in them like all other cellular compo nents according to the particular manner in which they integrate the struc ture of the living cell and participate in the realization of its autopoiesis23 Let us grantthat modem biology overemphasizes the role ofD N A and that DNA is as Maturana points out in this passage only one of many cellular components involved in reproduction Does he nevertheless go too far in the other direction by insisting that everything be subordinated to au topoiesis The problems created by subordinating everything to autopoiesis can be seen in The Tree of Knowledge an account of autopoiesis written for a gen eral audience24 As the opening diagram indicates Maturana and Varela envision each chapter leading into the next with the final one coming back to the beginning so that the form of the book recapitulates the circularity of autopoietic theory We shall follow a rigorous conceptual itinerary they announce in the introduction wherein every concept builds on preceding ones until the whole is an indissociable network p 9 In Autopoiesis and Cognition Maturana commented that he and Varela were unable to agree on how to contextualize the theory so he wrote the introduction by himself Now seven years later Varela is less his student and more an accomplished figure in his own right This is the last work the two men will coauthor to gether Varela has already begun to head in a different direction The di vergences in their viewpoints are accommodated through a clever visual device Certain key ideas are separated from the text and put into boxes Each box has a cartoon figure representing the speaker Maturanas figure wears heavy glasses and is noticeably older than Varelas so it is easy to iden tify which is which Sometimes Maturanas figure authorizes the boxed comments sometimes Varelas and sometimes both together Even with out the boxes it is not difficult to discern that Varelas voice is stronger in The Tree of Knowledge than in Autopoiesis and Cognition The Second Wave of Cybernetics I I take Varelas Buddhist orientation to be the inspiration behind what the authors announce as a central idea all doing is knowing and all know ing is doing p 27 They illustrate the concept by constructing the book as a circle starting their discussion with unicellular organisms first order sys tems progressing to multicellular organisms with nervous systems sec ondorder systems and finally coming to cognitively aware humans who interact through language thirdorder systems Pointing out that humans in tum are composed of cells they close the circle by nesting firstand secondorder systems within thirdorder systems thus joining the doing of autopoiesis with the knowing of eognitively aware creatures Autopoiesis is the governing idea connecting systems at all levels from the single cell to the most complex thinking being What defines living systems is their au topoietic organization and it is in this autopoietic organization that they be come real and specify themselves at the same time p 48 Traversing this path the doing of the readerthe linear turning of pages during the readingis to become a kind of knowing as the reader experiences the organization characteristic of autopoiesis through a textual structure that circles back on itself The problem comes when the authors try to articulate this circular structure together with evolutionary lineages In evolution lineage carries the sense both of continuity traced far enough back all life originates in singlecell organisms and of qualitative change different lines branch off from one another and follow separate evolutionary pathways Whereas in autopoiesis the emphaSiS falls on circular interactions in evolution lines proliferate into more lines as speciation takes place through such mecha nisms as genetic diverSity and differential rates of reproductive success The tension between evolutionary lines of descent and autopoietic circu larity becomes apparent in the authors claim that autopoiesis is conserved at every point as organisms evolve To describe the changes taking place the authors use the term natural drift There seems to be a natural drift in natural drift however and in later passages natural drift becomes structural drift If structure changes what does it mean to say that au topoiesis is conserved Here they fall back on the structureorganization distinction that they had previously used in Autopoiesis and Cognition Organization denotes those relations that must exist among the compo nents of a system for it to be a member of a specific class Structure denotes the components and relations that actually constitute a particular unity and make its organization real p 47 Interestingly they use a mechanical rather than a biolOgical analogy to illustrate the distinction A toilets parts can be made of wood or plastiC these different materials correspond to dif 52  Chapter Six ferences in structure Regardless of the material used however the toilet will still be a toilet ifit has a toilets organization The analogy is strangely in appropriate for biology All life is based on the same four nucleotides hence for living organisms it is not the material that changes but the way the material is organized What does it mean then to say that autopoiesis is conserved According to the authors it means that organization is conserved And what is organi zation Organization is those relations that must exist among the compo nents of a system for it to be a member of a specific class p 47 These definitions force one to choose between two horns of a dilemma Consider the case of an amoeba and a human Either an amoeba and a human have the same organization which would make them members of the same class in which case evolutionary lineages disappear because all living systems have the same organization or else an amoeba and a human have different organizations in which case organizationand hence autopoiesismust not have been conserved somewhere or in many places along the line The dilemma reveals the tension between the conservative circularity of autopoiesis and the linear thrust of evolution Either organization is con served and evolutionary change is effaced or organization changes and au topoiesis is effaced The strain of trying to articulate autopoiesis with evolution is perhaps most apparent in what is not said Molecular biology is scarcely mentioned and then only in contexts that underplay its importancea choice consis tent with Maturanas claim that heredity does not depend on nucleic acids There is an additional problem in bringing up molecular biology for any discussion of DNA coding would immediately reveal that the distinction between structure and organization cannot be absoluteand if this dis tinction goes autopoiesis is no longer conserved in evolutionary processes For if organization is construed to mean the biolOgical classes character ized as species then it is apparent that organization changes as speciation takes place If organization means something other than species then or ganization ceases to distinguish between different kinds of species and sim ply becomes the property of any living system Conserving organization means conserving life a fact that may be adequate for autopoiesis to qual ifY as a property ofliving systems but does nothing to articulate autopoiesis with evolutionary change The essential problem here is not primarily one of definitions although the problem becomes manifest at these sites in the text because definitions are used to anchor the argument which otherwise drifts off into such neb ulous terms as natural drift Rather the difficulties arise because of Mat The Second Wave of Cybernetics  uranas passionate desire to have something conserved in the midst of con tinuous change Leaving aside the problems with his explanation of struc ture and organization that something is basically the integrity of a selfcontained selfperpetuating system that is operationally closed to its environment In Maturanas metaphysics the system closes on itself and leaves historical contingency on the outside Even when he is concerned with the linear branching structures of evolution he turns this linearity into a circle and tries to invest it with a sense of inevitability Seen as a textual technology The Tree of Knowledge is an engine of knowledge production that vaporizes contingency by continuously circulating it within the space of its interlocking assumptions 25 Nowhere is the divergence of Varela and Maturana since 1980 clearer than on this point While Vaela moved on to other issues and ways of think ing about them Maturana continued to occupy essentially the same posi tion and to use the same language as in Autopoiesis and Cognition Clearly Maturana has a more intense and longlasting commitment to the original formulation of autopoiesis than does Varela Not COincidentally Maturana regards himself as the father of the theory whereas he sees Varelas role as more tangential In a 1991 article titled The Origin of the Theory of Au topoietic Systems he claims credit as the creator of the theory and says that Varela was very much a collaborator who appeared on the scene after the basic ideas had been formulated Strictly Francisco Varela did not contribute to the development of the notion of autopoiesis Maturana wrote This notion was developed between 1960 and 1968 Francisco was my student as an undergraduate during the years 1966 and 1967 in Santi ago then he went to Harvard where he was from 1968 to 1970 when he re turned to Chile to work with me in my laboratory in the Faculty of Sciences in Santiago Although Varelas Principles of Biological Autonomy clearly shows that Varela did most of the actual computer work in creating tessella tion automata Maturana claims credit for this idea too He wrote During the year 1972 I proposed one day to make a computer program that would generate an autopoietic system in a graphic space as the result of generat ing in that space certain elements like molecules26 In PrinCiples Varela acknowledged that Maturana was among those who have influenced this book so pervaSively that their thought was woven into it throughout but he also wrote in Describing the Logic of the Living his 1981 retrospec tive assessment of autopoiesis that the notion of autopoiesis was proposed by H umberto Maturana and myself 27 This jostling for position especially when a theory has proven to be histOrically important is of course common in almost every field and particularly in scientific communities where 154  Chapter Six great emphasis is placed on being the first to discover something I mention it here not in any way to diminish the contributions of either Maturana or Varela but to contextualize the fact that Varela moved on to other ways of thinking about autopoiesis while Maturana continued to write in much the same vein as when he had started The Voice of the Other Varela and Embodiment After The Tree of Knowledge Varela increasingly moved away from the clo sure that remains a distinctive feature of autopoiesis The change can be seen in Describing the Logic of the Living The Adequacy and Limitations of the Idea of Autopoiesis his contribution to the important 1981 collec tion edited by Milan Zeleny Autopoiesis A Theory of Living Organization While stressing that he continues to see autopoiesis as very valuable because it pointed to a neglecting of autonomy as basic to the living indi vidual Varela also criticizes autopoiesis for going both too far and not far enough p 37 It wenttoo far in his view in becoming a paradigm not just for biological organisms but for social systems as well Insisting that au topoiesis should not be confused with organizational closure in general he points out that the definition of autopoiesis has some precision because it is based on the idea of production of components and this notion of pro duction cannot be stretched indefinitely without losing all of its power pp 3738 Although cells and animals clearly do physically produce the components that instantiate their organization social systems do not De parting from Maturana on this point Varela would restrict autopoiesis to where in his view it is most applicable to the domain of cells and animals p38 Autopoiesis did not go far enough in building a bridge between its ap proach and the first wave emphasis on information flow teleology and be havior We did not take our criticism far enough to recover a nonnaive and useful role ofinformation notions in the descriptions ofliving phenomena he wrote Conceding that information coding and messages can be valid explanatory terms he suggests that they might serve as complementary modes of description for autopoiesis  p 39 Although he continues to maintain that autopoiesis is logically necessary to a complete explanation it may not be sufficient to give a satisfactory explanation oflivingphenomena on both logical and cognitive grounds p 44 There was evidently a need in Autopoiesis and Cognition to overemphasize a neglected side of a polarity p 39 To posit an analogous situation in literature imagine try ing to explain how to read a Shakespearean sonnet by starting out with a de The Second Wave of Cybernetics  scription of cellular processes Logically it is true that the behavior result ing in reading the sonnet has to originate in cellular processes but one does not need to be a literature teacher to see that a chunked higherlevel de scription would be much more useful What Varela argues for finally is a dual system of explanation The oper ational explanation would emphasize the physical concreteness of actual processes the symbolic or systemstheoretic explanation would emphasize more abstract ideas that help to construct the system at a higher level of generality Even so this duality of explanation should remain in full view as an antidote to those in computer science and systems engineering who mistake a symboliC deSCription for an operational one for example by considering that information and information processing are in the same category as matter and energy In this respect Varela remains fiercely loyal to autopoiesis To the extent that the engineering field is prescriptive by design this kind of epistemological blunder is still workable However it becomes unbearable and useless when exported from the domain of pre scription to that of deSCription of natural systems  To assume in these fields that information is some thing that is transmitted that symbols are things that can be taken at face value or that purposes and goals are made clear by the systems themselves is all it seems to me nonsense  Infor mation sensu strictu does not exist Nor do by the way the laws of nature p45 In more recent work Varela and his coauthors provide a positive di mension to this critique of disembodied information They explore the con structive role of embodiment in ways that go importantly beyond autopoiesis Although autopoietic theory implicitly privileges embodiment in its emphaSis on actual biological processes it has little to say about em bodied action as a dynamic force in an organisms development It is pre Cisely this point that is richly elaborated by Varela and his coauthors in their concept ofenaction28 Enaction sees the active engagement of an organ ism with the environment as the cornerstone of the organisms develop ment The difference in emphaSiS between enaction and autopoiesis can be seen in how the two theories understand perception Autopoietic theory sees perception as the systems response to a triggering event in the sur rounding medium Enaction by contrast emphaSizes that perception is constituted through perceptually guided actions so that movement within an environment is crucial to an organisms development As Varela further explained in Making It Concrete Before During and After Break downs enaction concurs with autopoiesis in insisting that perception must not be understood through the viewpOint of a pregiven perceiver 156  Chapter Six independent world Whereas autopoietic theory emphasizes the closure of circular processes however enaction sees the organisms active engage mentwith its surroundings as more openended and transformative A sim ilar difference informs the views of cognition in the two theories For autopoiesis cognition emerges from the recursive operation of a system representing to itself its own representations Enaction by contrast sees cognitive structures emerging from recurrent sensorymotor patterns29 Hence instead of emphasizing the circularity of autopoietic processes en action emphasizes the links of the nervous system with the sensory surfaces and motor abilities that connect the organism to the environment Embedded in the idea of enaction is also another story about what con sciousness means a story different from that articulated by autopoietic theory In The Embodied Mind Cognitive Science and Human Experience Varela and his coauthors take the Buddhistinspired point of view that the self is a story consciousness tells itself to block out the fear and panic that would ensue if human beings realized there is no essential self Opposed to the false unity and selfpresence of grasping consciousness is true aware ness which is based on actualizing within the mind an embodied realiza tion of the persons ongoing processes We saw that autopoietic theory invokes the domain of the observer as a way to integrate commonsense perceptions with the theorys epistemological radicalism a move that ended up deconstructing the liberal humanist subject in some respects but recuperating it in others By contrast in enaction consciousness is seen as a cognitive balloon that must be burst if humans are to recognize the true nature of their being The thrust of The Embodied Mind is to show that cog nitive science has already been headed in this direction and to interpret the Significance of this trajectory in the framework of Buddhist philosophies of emptiness and the notself Here the boundaries of the liberal subject are not so much penetrated stretched or dissolved as they are revealed to have been an illusion all along In contrast to the anxiety and nostalgia that Wiener and Maturana expressed when confronted with the loss of the lib eral subject Varela speaking in a voice now not conjoined with his teacher and mentor celebrates the moment when the self drops away and aware ness expands into a realization of its true nature No longer Wieners island oflife in a sea of entropy or Maturanas autonomous circularity awareness realizes itself as a part of a larger wholeunbounded empty and serene What marks this realization as something other than a mystical vision is Varelas insistence that the most advanced research in Western cognitive science points toward the same conclusion Referencing such works as R Jackendoffs Consciousness and the Computational Mind and Marvin The Second Wave of Cybernetics  Minskys Society of Mind about which we will hear more in chapter 9 he and his coauthors show that contemporary models of cognition implicitly deconstruct the notion of a unified selfby demonstrating that cognition can be modeled through discrete and semiautonomous agents Each agent runs a modular program designed to accomplish a specific activity operat ing relatively independent of the others Only when conflicts occur be tween agents does an adjudicating program kick in to resolve the problem In this model consciousness emerges as an epiphenomenon whose role it is to tell a coherent story about what is happening even though this story may have little to do with what is happening processurally These models posit the mind Varela wrote not as a unified homogenous unity nor even as a collection of entities but rather as a disunified heterogeneous collec tion ofprocesses p 100 In Making It Concrete Varela expands this line of thought by showing how Minskys society of mind model can be combined with nonlinear dy namics to give an account ofliving systems in action He continues to insist on the importance of the concrete and embodied The concrete is not a step towards anything it is howwe arrive and where we stay Reminiscent of the autopoietic theorys claim that processes happen always and only in the present he remarks that it is in the immediate present that the con crete actually lives p 98 To show how Minskys model is incomplete he points out that it is not a model of neural networks or societies it is a model of the cognitive architecture that abstracts again from neurolOgical detail and hence from the web of the living and of lived experience What is missing here he continues is the detailed link between such agents and the incarnated coupling by sensing and acting which is essential to living cognition p 99 The question he poses is how the mind can move smoothly from one agent processing its program to another agent running quite another pro gram To answer this question satisfactorily he suggests we need to link these abstractions with embodied processes He proposes a readiness to action that in effect constitutes a microidentity As an example he imag ines a man walking down the street and Varela sketches the kind ofbehav ior associated with this microidentity Suddenly the man realizes he has left his billfold behind in the last store he visited Instantly a different micro identity kicks in geared toward a search operation rather than a leisurely stroll down the street How does one get from the microidentity of stroll to the microidentity of intense search The answer Varela speculates in volves chaotic fast dynamiCS that allows emergent selforganizing struc tures to arise In linking the dynamiCS of selforganizing structures with 158  Chapter Six microidentities Varela is following a line of thought vigorously pursued by Zeleny and others who want to join autopoietic theory with the dynamics of selforganizing systems30 The idea is to supplement autopoietic theory so that it can also more adequately account for change and transformation and also to specifY the mechanisms and dynamics through which an au topoietic system progresses from one instant in the present to another These revisions aim to jog autopoietic theory out of its relentless repetitive circularity by envisioning a living organism as a fast responsive flexible and selforganizing system capable of constantly reinventing itself some times in new and surprising ways In this tum toward the new and unex pected autopoietic theory begins to look less like the homeostasis of the first wave and more like the selfevolving programs that will be discussed in chapter 9 as exemplars of thirdwave cybernetics As autopoietic theory continues to evolve what are likely to be the en during contributions of autopoiesis as Maturana originally formulated it In my view these will certainly include the follOwing his emphasis on the concreteness and specificity of embodied processes his insistence that the observer must be taken into account with all the implications this has for scientific objectivism his distinction between allopoietic and autopoietic systems and the ethical implications bound up with making this distinc tion and his insight that in a literal sense we make a world for ourselves by living it In one of his more radical moments Maturana used the insights of au topoiesis to push toward a formulation that taken out of context sounds solipsistic indeed We do not see what we do not see and what we do not see does not exist31 In context he is always careful to qualify this apparent solipsism by pointing out that a world outside the domain of one observer may exist for others as when I see a large stationary object that a frog can not perceive In this way the worlds existence is recuperated in a modified sensenot as an objectively existing reality but as a domain that is con stantly enlarging as selfconscious scientific observers operate recur Sively on their representations to generate new representations and realizations If this isnt exactly the scientific quest for new knowledge it nevertheless allows for a qualified vision of scientific progress But what if the observer ceases to be constructed as a generic marker and becomes invested with a specific psychology including highly idiosyn cratic and possibly psychotic tendencies Will the domains of self conscious observers fail to stabilize external reality Will the uncertainties then go beyond questions of epistemology and become questions of ontol ogy Will the observation that what we do not see does not exist sink deep The Second Wave of Cybernetics  into the structure of reality undermining not only our ability to know but the ability of the world to be To entertain these suppositions is to enter into the world as it is constructed in the literary imagination of Philip K Dick Writing contemporaneously with Maturana but apparently with no knowl edge of autopoietic theory Dick is obsessed with many of the same issues In turning from Maturanas radical epistemology to Dicks radical ontology we will follow our evolving stories of the reification of information the con struction of the cyborg and the emergence of the posthuman into a phan tasmagoric territory that continues to exist only as long as an observer thinks it does And what observers Dicks characters tum out to be   ch Q pre  r  se ye n TURNING REALITY INSIDE OUT AND RIGHT SIDE OUT BOUNDARY WORK IN THE MIDSIXTIES NOVELS OF PHILIP K DICK As much as any literary work in his generation Philip K Dicks fictions en act the progressively deeper penetration of cybernetic technologies into the fabric of the world For a public fascinated by the artificial lifeforms made famous in Blade Runner adapted from his most famous novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep his work demonstrates how potent the android is as an object for cultural appropriation in the late twentieth century Consistently in his fictions androids are associated with unstable boundaries between self and world The form that these associations take may be idiosyncratic but the anxieties that his texts express are not Sub terranean fears about the integrity of the subject under the cybernetic par adigm were already present in the subtext of Norbert Wieners 1948 Cybernetics as we saw in chapter 4 When system boundaries are defined by information flows and feedback loops rather than epidermal surfaces the subject becomes a system to be assembled and disassembled rather than an entity whose organic wholeness can be assumed For Humberto Maturana the problem of system definition was solved by positing a circular dynamic whereby the living continually produces and reproduces the relations constituting its organization In effect he turned first wave cybernetics inside out Instead of treating the system as a black box and focusing on feedback loops between the system and the envi ronment he treated the environment as a black box and focused on the reflexive processes that enable the system to produce itself as such He de veloped the political implications of autopoietic theory by suggesting that power struggles often take the form of an autopoietic system forcing an other system to become allopoietic so that the weaker system is made to serve the goals of the stronger rather than pursuing its own systemic unity Dicks relation to the work of Maturana and Francisco Varela is almost Turning Reality Inside Out  certainly not a case of direct influence Rather both Dick and the creators of autopoiesis were responding to the problem of incorporating the ob server into the system and as a result were experimenting with more or less radical espistemologies Without using autopoietic terminology in deed there is no evidence that he knew of it Dick explored the political dimension of androidhuman interactions in terms consistent with Matu ranas analysis In Do Androids Dream Roy Baty understands full well that androids have been denied the status of the living and consequently forced to serve as slaves rather than function as the autopoietic systems they are capable of becoming The struggle to achieve autopoietic status can be un derstood as a boundary dispute in which one tries to claim the privileged outside position of an entity that defines its own goals while forcing ones opponent to take the inside position of an allopoietic component incor porated into a larger system Working along apparently independent lines of thought Dick understood that how boundaries are constituted would be a central issue in deciding what counts as living in the late twentieth century Especially revealing are the novels he wrote from 1962 to 1966 when he popped amphetamines like crazy and channeled the released energy into an astonishingly large creative output eleven novels in one year alone in cluding a series of major works that sought to define the human by juxta posing it with artificial lifeforms 1 Drawing on the scientific literature on cybernetics Dicks narratives extend the scope of inquiry by staging con nections between cybernetics and a wide range of concerns including a devastating critique of capitalism a view of gender relations that ties to gether females and androids an idiosyncratic connection between entropy and schizophrenic delusion and a persistent suspicion that the objects sur rounding usand indeed reality itselfare fakes At the center of this extraordinarily complex traffic between cultural scientific and psycholOgical implications of cybernetiCS stands what I will call the schizoid android a multiple pun that hints at the splittings com binations and recombinations through which Dicks writing performs these complexities In Dicks fiction the schizoid functions as if autistic Typically gendered female she is often represented as a bright cold emo tionally distant woman She is characterized by a flattening of affect and an inability to feel empathy incapable of understanding others as people like herself Whether such creatures deserve to be called human or are things most appropriately classified as androids is a question that resonates throughout Dicks fictions and essays In one ofits guises then the schizoid android represents the coming together of a person who acts like a machine  Chapter Seven with a literal interpretation of that person as a machine In other instances however the android is placed in opposition to the schizoid If some hu mans can be as unfeeling as androids some androids turn out to be more feeling than humans a confusion that gives Do Androids Dream its extra ordinary depth and complexity The capacity of an android for empathy warmth and humane judgment throws into ironic relief the schizoid womans incapacity for feeling If even an android can weep for others and mourn the loss of comrades how much more unsympathetic are unfeeling humans The android is not so much a fixed symbol then as a Signifier that enacts as well as connotes the schizoid splitting into the two opposed and mutually exclusive subject positions of the human and the not human Implicated in these boundary disputes between human and android are the landscapes of Dicks midsixties novels Typically these are highly commercialized spaces in which the boundaries between autonomous in dividual and technological artifact have become increasingly permeable Circulating through them are not only highend products such an intelli gent androids but also a more general technoanimation of the landscape artificial insects that buzz around spouting commercials coffeepots that demand coins before they will begin to perk and homeostatic apartment doors that refuse to open for the tenant until fed the appropriate credit The interpellation of the individual into market relations so thoroughly defines the characters of these novels that it is impossible to think of the characters apart from the economic institutions into which they are incor porated from small family firms to transnational operations Moreover the corporation is incorporated in multiple senses emplOying people who fre quently owe to the corporation not only their economic and social identities but also the very corporeal forms that define them as physical entities from organ implants and hypertrophied brains to completely artificial bodies Given this dynamiC it is no surprise that the struggle for freedom often ex presses itself as an attempt to get outside this corporate encapsulation The ultimate horror for the individual is to remain trapped inside a world constructed by another being for the others own profit The figure of the android thus allows Dick to combine a scathing cri tique of the politics of incorporation with the psychological complexities of trying to decide who qualifies as an authentic human Gender dynamiCS is central to these complexities for when the schizoid woman is brought into close proximity with a male character he reacts to the androidism in her personality by experiencing a radical instability in the boundaries that define him and his world With the issue of what is outside someone elses inside already supercharged with psychological and political tensions Turning Reality Inside Out  these enfoldings further implicate capitalism with androidism the human with the nothuman and the technological with the ontologicalthat is cybernetics with the social political economic and psychological forma tions that define the liberal subject To unpack these complexities and re late them to the midsixties novels let us tum first to Dicks essays and biography where the genetic elements that make up these recombinant fictions can be found The Schizoid Woman and the DarkHaired Girl In How To Build a Universe That Doesnt Fall Apart Two Days Later a speech written in 1978 and first published in 1985 Dick linked the au thentic human with the real a construction that also implies its inverse Fake realities will create fake humans Or fake humans will generate fake realities and then sell them to other humans turning them eventually into forgeries of themselves2 The ontology of the human and the ontology of the world mutually construct each other When one is fake the other is con taminated by fakery as well when one is authentic the authenticity of the other is if not guaranteed at least held out as a strong possibility With so much riding on the authentic human the qualities defining it take on special significance Authenticity does not depend on whether the being in question has been manufactured or born made of flesh and blood or of electronic circuits The issue cannot be decided by phYSiolOgical cri teria Here Dick would agree with Maturana and Varela who argued that artifiCially created systems can certainly qualif as living Unlike Maturana and especially Varela however he leaps over the importance of embodi ment His fiction displays the same orientation for it shows almost no in terest in how intelligent machines are constructed dismissing the issue with a few words of handwaving explanations about homeostatic mech anisms The important point for Dick is not how intelligent machines are built but that they could be build Descriptions of bodies except those of women where the bodies serve as sexual markers also rarely appear in Dicks fiction The emphaSiS falls almost entirely on perception and think ing Without embodiment to stabilize his epistemological skeptiCism the cracks he opens in the perceiverS knowledge widen into rifts in the fabric of the world The differences between his ontological skepticism and autopoietic sta bility can be seen in how his fictions enact the human as distinct from how he defines the human in his essays In a formulation strikingly reminiscent of Maturana and Varela he suggests that the human is that which can 164  Chapter Seven create its own goal He goes on to develop other characteristics that for him set the human apart from the android being unique acting unpre dictably experiencing emotions feeling vital and alive The list reads like a compendium of qualities that the liberal humanist subject is supposed to have Yet every item on the list is brought into question by the humans and androids of Dicks fiction Human characters frequently feel dead inside and see the world around them as dead Many are incapable oflove or em pathy for other humans From the android side the confusion of bound aries is equally striking The androids and simulacra of Dicks fiction include characters who are empathic rebellious determined to define their own goals and as strongly individuated as the humans whose world they share What does this confusion signify Here I want to draw connections between Dicks biography and the fe male characters in his fiction a topic so obviously important to Dicks work that its absence from much of the criticism on Dick amounts to a scandaJ3 In The Evolution of a Vital Love Dick documents his fascination for a certain type of woman slender lithe and young younger and younger as he grew older with long dark hair Repeatedly he hooked up with such women in his life and wrote about them in his fiction He calls this type the darkhaired girl4 Although the physical type remained the same in The Evolution of a Vital Love he wrote about what he sees as a continuing development in these women and his relationships with them Whereas the first women fic tional and actual are schizoid cruel unfeeling and unempathicin short androids by his definitionlater he meets and has relationships with women who although they match the phYSical type are much warmer and more supportive of him and his goals For Dick the progression of the dark haired girl from schizoid to empathic is vitally important to defining the hu man and by implication the real To define what is real is to define what is human if you care about humans If you dont you are schizoid and like Pris a character in his novel We Can Build You and the way I see it an android that is not human and hence not real5 In Dicks reading of his life then the darkhaired girl started out being allied with the android but as time went on she became polarized against the android a stay against the unreality with which the android is perSistently linked It goes without saying I think that Dick regards himself as human Why then does he repeatedly refer to his attraction for the darkhaired girl as a programmed tropism a word he picked up from Norbert Wieners ac count of cybernetic creations such as the Moth which had build into it a tropism for light If programmed behavior marks the difference between the human and the android Dicks tropism for darkhaired girls puts him in Turning Reality Inside Out  seeks out the woman who he says evolved until she represented the authentically human These subterranean connections between the dark haired girl machine behavior and the construction of masculine subjectiv ity are explored repeatedly in the fiction through configurations that link androidism in an attractive darkhaired woman with a radical confusion of boundaries between inside and outside for a male subject The linkage also has implications for female subjectivity Replication the mark of the machine is injected back into the darkhaired girl even after she has sup posedly evolved beyond androidism because the male subjects tropism converts her into one of a series a succession of brunette women who are at once different and the samehence the multiple ambiguities of the de scriptor that Dick constructs for them the darkhaired girl The phrase points both to their singularity each takes the definite article and to their identity with one another Each is unique and uniquely remembered by Dick but remem bered as one of a repeating series that stretches back to the early stages of his erotic life Many of the critics who have written on Dicks critique of capitalism have scorned psychological explanations as iftheywere trivial or unrelated to Dicks satiric view of economic exploitation 6 But in Dicks fictional worlds psychology interpenetrates social structure Contradictions in so cial structure manifest themselves as aberrant psychology and aberrant psychology has social consequences Understanding the relation of Dicks life to his fictional constructions need not reduce his social critique to pri vate neurosis On the contrary it illuminates how he was able to fashion a syntheSiS that undermines precisely the distinctions that would keep the personal in a sanitized domain separate from the social political and eco nomic structures constituting the individual If we look for a psychological explanation for Dicks tropism its origins are not hard to find His parents were divorced when he was six and he was raised by his mother Dorothy Kindred Dick from whom he takes his mid dle name Whatever she was in fact Dick perceived her as an intellectually gifted but emotionally cold woman who denied him warmth and affection Yet he was also extremely dependent on her and maintained an emotional closeness almost incestuous in its intensity As his biographer Lawrence Sutin skillfully and senSitively shows the combination of extreme need for affection and extreme fear of rejection also marked his adult relationships especially his relationships with women 7 His anxiety toward his mother was brought into focus for him through his twin sister Jane who died at six weeks of age because Dorothy did not 166  Chapter Seven have enough milk for both infants and was too ignorant to realize that the twins already underweight at birth were becoming fatally malnourished Somehow I got all the milk Dick told his friends 8 The story of Janes death became a family legend Dick reported that Dorothy discussed it with him on several occasions trying to explain that she had done the best she could under the circumstances Her explanations ironically had the op posite effect for they vividly burned Janes existence into his consciousness and invested her with intense emotional significance As a young adult Dick developed a phobia about eating and could not consume food in pub lic as if eating were a deeply shameful act9 Despite Dorothys explanations Dick blamed his mother for Janes death seeing it as evidence of her inability to care physically and emotion ally for her children The blame was all the more intense because he must have felt that on some level he shared it having taken from Jane the milk she needed to survive He fantasized thatif Jane had lived she would have become a lovely darkhaired girl He came to believe that she was a lesbian a sexual orientation reflected in the character of Alys in Flow My Tears the Policeman Said 10 And he intuited that in some sense he continued to carry this shadowy Other within his body a figuration that reflected the fact that Jane no longer had an autonomous existence apart from his imagination of her Through no fault of her own she was fated to occupy the subordinate inside position while he the surviving twin had an outside subject po sition that made him a recognized person in the world 11 With Jane as the first darkhaired girl compounded with Dorothy from whom she could scarcely be separated in Dicks mind it is not difficult to see why the figure should be invested with so many conflicting emotional attributes Like Dorothy the darkhaired girls that Dick depicts in his fic tion are intellectually brilliant but emotionally cold capable of cutting the men around them to emotional shreds while feeling almost nothing them selves In his account of the women in his life he suggests that he was able to break away from this type of woman and find other darkhaired girls who were sympathetic These are the figures he intends to rally to his cause to help him defeat the android But his worst nightmare remains that the android will tum out to be none other than the darkhaired girl The enemy is the ally and the ally is the enemy enemy mine 12 It is no wonder that in his essays the accounts of the human and the android often seem self contradictory For the complexities this entangled he neededand usedfiction to articulate them fully Dicks distinctive gift as a writer was to combine the personal idiosyn crasies of the schizoid womandarkhaired girl configuration along with Turning Reality Inside Out  the insideoutside confusions with which it is entangled with much broader social interrogations into the insideoutside confusions of the mar ket capitalism that incorporates living beings by turning humans into ob jects at the same time that it engineers objects so that they behave like humans To explore further this complex nexus among the personal the po litical and the economic let us tum now to the fiction Capitalism and the Schizoid Android Elucidating the connection between Dicks fiction and capitalism is Carl Freedmans fine article arguing that Dicks fictional techniques reinscribe a postMarxist view of the subject13 Freedman points out that the schizohrenic subject as theorized by Lacan Deleuze Guattari and others evolves as an interplay between an alienated I and an alienating not I Under capitalism these theorists argue schizophrenia is not a psychologi cal aberration but the normal condition of the subject Freedman further argues that paranoia and conspiracy favorite Dickian themes are inherent to a social structure in which hegemonic corporations act behind the scenes to affect outcomes that the populace is led to believe are the result of de mocratic procedures Acting in secret while maintaining a democratic fa cade the corporations tend toward conspiracy and those who suspect this and resist are viewed as paranoiac Dicks novel The Simulacra seems tailormade to illustrate Freedmans point about the synergistic relation between capitalism and paranoid schiz ophrenia Set in the USEA United States of Europe and America The Simulacra depicts a capitalist society that includes Germany as one of its most powerful states Although national elections still exist the president has been reduced to a nominal figurehead der AIte The country appears to be run by the first lady Nicole Thibodeaux who takes as her husband whatever man the electorate chooses for her every four years Unbe knownst to the electorate der Alte is a simulacrum Nicole herself is re vealed to be a lookalike playing Nicole who died several years earlier and has since been played by a succession of actresses Behind Nicole is the shadowy Council whose orders she follows but even Nicole has never seen the Council Thus the entire government is a fake its real machinery hid den behind Nicoles beautiful face The presidential simulacrum far from being an anomaly serves as a metaphor for the entire political process Social classes are divided between the Ge high status and the Be low status The Signifier generating the classes is the Geheimnis the secret Those who know the secret that the government has become in Dickian tenns a giant android rather than a human institutionare the Geheim nistrager bearers of the secret in contrast to the Befahaltrager those who merely carry out instructions Thus economic distinctions merge seam lesslywith the kind of social structure that a paranoid schizophrenic might imagine when constructing a system that brings everything together into a monolithic system of explanation Paranoid schizophrenia is enacted most dramatically through the char acter of Richard Kongrosian a psionic pianist who plays his instrument without touching the keys Already unstable Kongrosian is thrown into schizophrenia when he learns that der Alte is a simulacrum The news shakes his faith in Nicole who has served as his anchor in reality a function that the darkhaired girl frequently plays for Dicks male characters He suspects that Nicole is contaminated by the android government she serves precisely the fear that haunts Dicks essays and this intrusion of an droidism tips his already fragile psyche into psychosis Something terri bles happening to me he warns Nicole I no longer can keep myself and my environment separate As she watches he makes a vase on the desk sail through the air and enter his body telling her I absorbed it Now its me And He gestured at the desk T mit The process also works in reverse Where the vase had been Nicole sees forming into density and mass and colour a complicated tangle of interwoven organic matter smooth red tubes and what appeared to be portions of an endocrine system  The or gan whatever it was regularly pulsed it was alive and active  Im turn ing inside out Kongrosian wailed Pretty soon if this keeps up Im going to have to envelop the entire universe and everything in it and the only thing thatll be outside me will be my internal organs and then most likely Ill die14 The conjunction in this scene of androidism schizophrenia and a pro found confusion of inside and outside is more than coincidence Kon grosian enacts a confusion of boundaries not unlike commodity fetishism Freedman recalls for his readers Marxs view of how commodities become fetishized under capitalism Once objects are imbued with exchange value they seem to absorb into themselves the vitality of the human relations that created them as commodities Freedman reminds us that one definition for reification is the projection of social relations onto the relations of objects The incidents that precipitate Kongrosians turning inside out suggest that the specter of the android has somehow caused this bizarre phenomenon In fact the android performs an extraordinarily complex staging of reifica tion in Dicks fiction On the one hand it is a commodity an object created by humans and sold for money In this guise it is reified in much the same Turning Reality Inside Out  69 way that any object capable of being bought and sold is reified like the ani mals that bestow high status on their human owners in Do Androids Dream or like der Alte in The Simulacra whose sole function as an object is to serve as a signifier for the democratic processes that are as fake as helit is In another sense however der Alte is an anomaly among Dicks androids for most of them  Rachael Rosen Abraham Lincoln Edwin M Stantonare shown in scenes that make them virtually indistinguishable from humans They think feel outrage bond with their fellows Given their abilities they should be able to participate in the social realm of human re lations but in such texts as Do Androids Dream they can do so legally only as objects In this view they are not objects improperly treated as if they were social beings but are social beings improperly treated as if they were objects For them the arrow of reification points painfully in both di rections The scene in which Kongrosian turns inside out is revealing in another respect as well forit demonstrates the megalomaniac expansion of self that the paranoid schizophrenic experiences in the frenzy of delirium The paranoid feels compelled to interpret all the surrounding mysterious signs and order them into a Single coherent system From here it is a small step to feeling responsible for the signs If everything that happens is the para noids responsibility the belief easily follows that the paranoid actually caused all these events When Kongrosian states Im going to have to en velop the entire universe and everything in it his actions can be under stood as a literalization of this view Gifted or cursed with telekinesis he causes things to happen in the world by thinking about them From this he moves on to believing that he orders the universe then he progresses to the fantasy that he is the universe Part of the guerrilla warfare that Dick stages on the everyday is to valorize such perceptions by rendering them as events that other characters witness and that the narrator reports as actually happening In this way the readers perceptions undergo a transformation similar to Kongrosians for our relationship to the character is turned in side out Instead of his world existing inside our minds the textual world is rendered so as to make our perceptions work as if they were part of his in ternal world The battle to occupy the external position relative to other characters is waged over and over in Dicks fiction in different guises The stakes are high for if the self is unable to expand to megalomaniac proportions it is likely to shrink so that it becomes merely a dot on the horizon an atom in a cold pitiless inanimate landscape shaped by the dead forces of cause and effect and completely unresponsive to human desire This is the tomb  Chapter Seven world the landscape in which entropy rules Frequently the pendulum will swing between dangerous hyperinflation and excruciating shrinkage of the ego without ever stabilizing at the middle position of everyday reality Scott Durham has perceptively pOinted out that this alternation be tween the expanding self and the shrinking self is intimately related to the constitution of subjectivity under capitalism 15 Capitalism encourages the inflation of desire marketing its products by seducing the consumer with power fantasies But when the realization sinks in that this is merely a capi talist ploy the subject shrinks in inverse proportion to how much it had ear lier inflated So in Dicks novel The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch ChewZ is marketed by linking it with claims of omnipotence through the slogan GOD PROMISES ETERNAL LIFE WE CAN DELIVER IT16 When the subject consumes the product figuratively and also literally by ingesting it he finds that he is catapulted into a world where Palmer Eldritch makes all the rules Rather than taking the product inside him he has been im prisoned inside the product For he soon discovers that no matter what es cape hatch he builds or invents Palmer Eldritch remains exterior to his reality determining its workings and glinting through the other characters as they begin to manifest Eldritchs telltale stigmata The eternity delivered here is precisely not the apotheosis of the liberal autonomous subject capa ble of free thought and action but is the subject as pawn in a capitalists game imprisoned for eons in a universe that a terrifYing and menacing alien other has created to increase his profits The boundary instability that the Kongrosian scene so vividly illustrates recurs repeatedly in Dicks midsixties novels In one version of the drama the male subject expands and contracts in an agonized dance between megalomania and victimization This dance is intimately bound up with a related oscillation in the attractive female character between the schizoid woman and the darkhaired girl In the promiscuous couplings these vari ous subject positions permit the android serves as an ambiguous term that simultaneously incorporates the liberal subject into the machine and chal lenges its construction in the flesh To develop further the complex con nections and disjunctions Signified by the schizoid android I tum now to pick up again the thread of the schizoid womandarkhaired girl The Schizoid Woman DeConstructs Male Subjectivity Patricia Warrick has insightfully argued that Dicks fiction is structured as a series of reversals deSigned to defeat the readers expectation that it is pos sible to discover what the situation really is17 Building on her argument Turning Reality Inside Out  and also modifying it I want to demonstrate that the reversals are not arbi trary but follow an inner lOgic of their own I shall take as my tutor text We Can Build You in part because Warrick remarks in passing that its two themesthe construction of androids and the male characters fascination with the schizoid womanare not connected with each other which she sees as an aesthetic failing I will argue that although the themes are not well integrated they are deeply connected through the figure of the schizoid android As Dick recognizes in The Evolution of a Vital Love the prototype for the schizoid woman is Pris in We Can Build You Louis Rosen the little guy who serves as protagonist for the novel finds Pris fascinating but also terri fYing Her most notable attribute is what he calls emptiness dead center an inability to feel empathy or indeed almost any emotion 18 Talented cre ative and fiercely intelligent Pris had a nervous breakdown while still in high school as did Dick himself When she takes up with the rich entre preneur Sam Barrows deserting the family firm to move in the glittering world of the rich and famous Louiss attraction to her becomes compulsive The more this darkhaired girlschizoid woman recedes out of his realm the more he yearns after her finally becoming so obsessed that getting together with her becomes more important to him than anything else including the family firm What a woman what a thing to fall in love with he thinks to himself in a conflation that makes clear that Pris as a schizoid woman has more than a touch of androidism in her It was as ifPris to me were both life itselfand antilife the dead the cruel the cutting and rending and yet also the spirit of existence itself p 155 As her new name Pris Womankind indicates she is at once uniquely herself and symbolic of the role that Dick assigned to the bright cold cutting women in his life particularly his mother Dorothy and after they divorced his fourth wife Nancy More than a tie to life Pris is Louiss anchor to reality much as Nicole was for Kongrosian in The Simulacra Atthe same time Lollis expe riences Pris as the antilife which in later novels takes shape as the tomb world The flips that Warrick notices in Dicks text have an inner logic that make it impossible for the male character to do without the darkhaired girlschizoid woman even when he sees her as a source of powerful conta mination driving him into psychOSiS When Louis and Pris rendezvous at a motel the encounter fizzles be cause neither can abandon their catandmouse games long enough to ex perience physical intimacy Still obsessed he falls into a delusional state in which he hallucinates that he is making love to her although he is alone with his father and his brother in a bedroom and his lovemaking takes place while they look on bemusingly By the novels end he traces Pris to the mental institution where she has been readmitted and he himself be comes a patient After months of drug therapy in which he hallucinates that they court marry and have a child he finally has a chance to talk with her She tells him she will soon be leaving and suggests how he can present his case to be dismissed also He wins dismissal only to learn that Pris has de ceived him I lied to you Louis she tells him Im not up for release Im much too sick I have to stay here a long time more maybe forever p 252 For Louis sanity means lOSing her and with her the vitality of life which can be seen as a kind of mental illness but having her means mental illness of another kind The ambiguity ofPriss motives in this final scenedoes she trick Louis because she doesnt want him around or because she wants him to get on with his life indicates that even in a female protagonist figured mostly as a schizoid woman Hashes of the empathic darkhaired girl still appear In Do Androids Dream these instabilities in the female subject position are exacerbated as the schizoid woman is broken into twin characters Rachael Rosen and Pris Stratton The two are the same model of android a Nexus 6 so they are physically identical But they play very different roles in the plot Rachael becomes for Deckard a particularly ambivalent version of the darkhaired girl 19 At his low point she comes to him and they end up in bed in a sexual liaison that Pris and Louis couldnt manage to bring off Dur ing this scene and the one follOwing her characterization oscillates wildly between a desirable empathic partner and a cold calculating manipulator The scenes are worth looking at in detail for what they reveal about the dynamic of the male character who experiences the schizoid woman as a splitting between an android literally so with Rachael and the darkhaired girl Deckard calls Rachael because she has offered to help him retire the escaped N exus6 androids When he shows her his hit list she turns pale because one of the androids andys Pris is the same model as she is Earlier that day Rick working with Phil Resch had helped to kill Luba Loft an escaped android who was also a superb opera singer After Deckard expressed regret at Lubas death Resch depicted as a cold blooded killer who unlike Deckard feels no empathy for Luba or any of the androids he kills interprets his regret as sexual desire Although hu manandroid sex is strictly illegal he confesses that he once fancied a fe male android and advises Deckard that instead of killing the android and then wanting her he should go to bed with her first and kill her afterward Now in the hotel room with Rachael it occurs to Deckard that he is inad Turning Realit Inside Out  vertently about to follow Reschs advice for he intends to go to bed with Rachael and kill Pris afterward Shaken by the realization he refuses to have sex with Rachael In a lastditch attempt to cajole him she tells him she loves him and then when he still refuses offers to kill Pris herself She explains I cant stand getting this close and then p 170 After the sex Rachael apparently feels free to reveal her motives She tells Deckard that his career as a bounty hunter is over because no man who has gone to bed with her has found it possible afterward to kill any androids She has had sex with several bounty hunters she explains placidly and it has worked every time The one exception is a very cynical man Phil Resch p 174 The euphemism that Deckard uses to describe killing androids retiring themironically returns in a reversal that has a female android retiring bounty hunters2o Rachaels strategy implies that she feels empa thy for her fellow androids giving the lie to the governments position that androids feel no loyalty to each other If she can care for her fellow an droids we may wonder if she also cares for Deckard as she claims when she tells him that she loves him Enraged by her revelation that she has retired him Deckard tries to kill her and cannot whereupon she reproaches him for lOving the Nubian goat he has acquired with his bounty money more than he does hera re sponse that works on multiple levels It hints at the ironic fact that humans revere animal life but feel free to kill intelligent android life and it also sug gests that Rachael although she uses Deckard for her own political pur poses cares about whether he cares for her After Deckard succeeds in killing the last three andys he returns home to discover that Rachael has pushed the goat off the roof an act that conflates her jealousy of the goat with revenge for Deckards killing her friends The mixture of human pas sion and cold calculation in Rachaels responses shows that she combines within herself attributes of the darkhaired girl and of the android The closer the relationship gets to intimacy the wilder the oscillations between these subject positions become in tum inducing alternating moods in Deckard between despair and empowerment ego shrinkage and inflation It is as if Deckards attraction to her were destabiliZing reality itself That possibility latent in Deckards relationship with Rachael becomes overt in J R Isidores perceptions Deckards desire for Rachael is formally mirrored in the plot by J Rs desire for her twin Pris Rachaels character split within itself splits again into Rachael and Pris a division in which Rachael is closer to the darkhaired girl and Pris to the schizoid woman Whereas Rachaels manipulation of Deckard is relatively subtle Priss ma nipulation ofJ R is baldfaced and cold Although J R fantasizes that per 74 I Chapter Seven haps they might have a relationship Pris never indicates any feeling for him and it is clear that sex between them isnt going to happen In We Can Build You Louis likens Pris to a spider seeing her as an alien being who goes about her business oblivious of her effects on others The image re turns in Do Androids Dream in the scene in which Pris and Irmgard Baty holed up in J Rs apartment cut off the legs of a spider which J R has found to see how many legs it can do without and still walk As a chicken head this societys term for someone who is degenerating mentally J R lacks Deckards analytical skills and he often expresses his insights visually and intuitively such as when he briefly hallucinates that Roy Baty is made of gears and coils rather than flesh and blood Faced with this desecration of Mercers decree that all life is sacred J R perceives the force of kip pie a neologism that Dick uses for the entropic decay that has been nibbling away at the apartment building suddenly becoming an avalanche of de struction Chairs crumble the table melts askew gaping holes appear in the walls From Priss exclamations the reader knows that J R has gone berserk and is causing the destruction himself Nowhere perhaps is Dicks conflation of cybernetic concerns with idiosyncratic psychology more ap parent than in this scene The entropic decay that Wiener imagined could be forestalled by cybernetics is preternaturally accelerated until it is viSibly apparent in the landscape and this visibility also functions as a sign that sys tem boundaries have become radically unstable The moment is a finely re alized piece of writing that performs cybernetic boundary disputes in a context that makes clear their relation to a male characters attachment to the female androidschizoid woman The result is a deep confusion of boundaries between inside and outside Confronted with Priss torture of the spider and thus impliCitly with her emotional coldness J R perceives the heat energy rushing from the room as if the rooms physical decay sprang directly from her lack of empathy As this conflation of insideoutside suggests his perception of the boundaries between himself and the outside world has become badly distorted The psychological dynamiC is clear from Dicks repeated use of the situation The male self yearns to expand outward in a moment of union but when the fe male androidschizoid woman rejects him the result is a devastating insta bility in which it is difficult or impossible for him to establish robust boundaries between himself and the world Louis Rosen rejected by Pris Womankind projects his fantasies of her into a hallucinatory love partner J R Isidore shocked by Pris Strattons cruelty to his spider perceives his own rampage as the impersonal force of kip pie at work In Dicks novels the sud den collapse of an insideoutside distinction is often a sign thatthe male sub Turning Reality Inside Out I 75 ject is plunging into psychosis One of the sites where this dynamic plays it self outis the tomb world Let us tum now to a closer examination of this sur realistic landscape to explore its connection with the schizoid android Wasting Time in the Tomb World In Do Androids Dream a compelling proof of the official ideology that androids occupy a category ontologically distinct from that of humans is the fact that androids cannot experience fusion with Mercer a quasireligious figure who appears when a human grips the handles of the empathy box Androids incapable of experiencing this fusion are judged to be lacking in empathy the touchstone of the authentic person Staging a moment in human history when androids rival or surpass humans intellectually Do Androids Dream shows the essential quality of the human shifting from rationality to feeling Animals evoking feeling in their owners and capable of feeling themselves occupy the privileged position of fellow creatures whose lives like human lives are sacred whereas the rational androids are denied the status of the living The change comes when nonhuman ani mals rapidly fading into extinction have ceased to pose any conceivable threat to human domination Since the real threat now comes from the an droids the shift in definition is hardly a coincidence To extend the critique Dick emphasizes the capitalist marketing of animals an industry fueled by the religious significance that owning an animal has under Mercerism Like certain forms of Puritanism Mercerism joins with capitalism to create a system in which the financially privileged merge seamlessly with the reli giously sanctified Despite this pOinted satire Dicks treatment of Mercerism remains complexly ambiguous The text refuses an eitheror choice and implies that Mercerism is both political hucksterism and a genuinely meaningful experience In an expose by Buster Friendly a radio talkshow host later re vealed to be an android Mercer is proved to be a fake a drunk hired by un known parties to act out a few cheesy scenes of humiliation and atonement on cheap sets Yet Mercer is also an inspiring figure who mysteriously ap pears to Deckard to tell him that killing androids is both wrong and neces sary just as Mercer acknowledges that he is at once fake and genuine These multiple confusions are reenacted when J R already operating in the borderland between hallucination and reality rushes to the empathy box after the tidal wave of kipple engulfs his apartment As he grabs the handles he plays out the scenario that Mercer endlessly repeats in a land scape hovering ambiguously between the internal and external worlds 176  Chapter Seven Like Sisyphus Merceris doomed to climb up a dusty hill while unseen tor mentors throw rocks at him only to slide back down when he reaches the top But he does not merely regress to the bottom He plunges all the way down into the tomb world a world where nothing but him lives a world populated by the decaying skeletons and rotting carcasses of animals In the tomb world time has either stopped or moves so slowly that its passage cannot be perceived All one can do is wait passively for what seems like eons in the utter desolation surrounded by death and decay until very slowly things begin to come alive again and it is possible to climb out A clue to the psychological significance of the tomb world comes in Dicks analysis of schizophrenia in Schizophrenia and The Book of Changes 21 In high school Dick experienced an agoraphobia so acute that he had to be tutored at home As a young man he compulsively engaged in various neurotic behaviors including his eating disorder He had three ner vous breakdowns and attempted suicide several times When he talks about the experience of mental illness therefore we may suppose he knows whereof he speaks Writing at a time when R D Laing was calling for a reassessment of schizophrenia Dick echoed Laing in viewing schizo phrenia with sympathy and even admiration22 In a letter to Patricia Warrick he wrote that he wanted to draw a sharp line between the neu rotic schizoid whom he saw as an essentially cold person seeking power over others and the psychotic schizophrenic who is too nuts to be much of a threatto anyone but himself or herself 23 In contrastto his scathing in dictment of the schizoid who withdraws emotions from the world Dick saw the schizophrenic as someone who suffers because of projecting emo tions too much into the world His sympathy is evident in The Android and the Human when he ob serves that for the schizophrenic time stops because nothing new can hap pen24 The ego has become so distended so inHated that it blocks out everything else Since the self is perceived as responsible for explaining everything and putting itinto order there can be no surprises The new the inexplicable the mysterious and the unexplained do not exist for the para noid schizophrenic The tomb world is a literary and fictional representa tion of this state seen from the point of view of the person who experiences it The dreariness the hopelessness the feeling that time has stopped and there is nothing to do but wait the deadness inside projected onto an exte rior landscapethese are the markers of extreme mental distress as Dick describes them The tomb world appears in several of Dicks fictions from the midsixties and it is always associated with a deep confusion of in sideoutside boundaries Turning Reality Inside Out  The insideoutside confusion links the schizophrenic to the android Like the schizophrenic the android is a hybrid figurepart human part machinewhose very existence calls boundaries into question Whereas the androids actions are always predictablethe android is characterized bypredictabilitymost of all Dick wrote in The Android and the Human p 191for the paranoid schizophrenic the worlds actions are always predictable In the first case the predictability is understood as coming from the androids internal programming in the second case the pre dictability is perceived as originating in the external world This distinction is moot in the tomb world however for inside and outside merge in its am biguous landscape Surely it is no accident that Dicks midsixties novels in which the tomb world prominently appears also feature android charac ters The android that Dick writes about in his essays represents the loss of free play creativity and most of all vitalityin short the triumph of ob session over the flexibility and empathy that a writer needs to create the new Yet as we have seen Dicks fictional androids are considerably more complex than this portrayal We can understand this contrast through a paradox the simple version of the android represents a loss of vitality that would make writing impossible yet this view of androidism is precisely what Dick makes into the occasion for writing Androidism both annihi lates writing and makes it possible The paradox is written into Mercerism through the ambiguities it generates between self and other The moment a human grasps the empathy box his consciousness fuses with that of un known and unnamed others He is both alone and in company cut off from his surroundings and in emotional communication with other human be ings In short he partakes of the instabilities that male subjects feel when they come into close proximity with female characters who participate in the schizoid womanandroiddarkhaired girl configuration He experi ences an ego expansion that although it can be extremely dangerous if it progresses into megalomania in the empathy box remains relatively con tained and so is relatively benign Even so the downside is hardly negligible The empathy box interpo lates the private delusions of the subject into a shared ideology that in scribes his characteristic experiences into scripts invested with religious political and social Significance As Jill Galvin points out there are hints that the government faced with a declining population in a world rapidly becoming uninhabitable by humans encourages the use of the empathy box to keep citizens quiescent and tractable 25 In the empathy box citizens feel empowered but the endless scenarios they play out make clear that 78 I Chapter Seven they are in fact powerless a paradox that is a more insidious version of Dicks empowerment by writing about the hopelessness and androidism of the tomb world Buster Friendly his ulterior motives notwithstanding makes a good point when he asks his listeners to question what it is that Mercerism does Well if were to believe its many practitioners the expe rience fuses  men and women throughout the Sol System into a Single entity But an entity which is manageable by the socalled telepathic voice of Mercer An ambitious politicallyminded wouldbe Hitler could26 Despite the obvious exploitative potential of Mercerism Dick also in sists that alongside its fakery there exists a possibility for genuine atone ment and redemption a possibility written into Do Androids Dream when Mercers intervention saves Deckards life If Mercer is in some sense real as well as fake then the tomb world must also at once be a delusion and a necessary purgation The key to understanding its mysterious double na ture lies in the schizoid womandarkhaired girl configuration As we have seen the oscillation between the darkhaired girl and the schizoid woman becomes more pronounced the closer the male character draws to her The male character nurses a fierce ambivalence toward her both desiring inti macy and fearing it Because of the multiplicity of her nature as Dick con structs it she is the perfect screen on which to project this ambivalence On the one hand she represents a rejection all the more inevitable and ab solute because it springs not from deficiencies in the male which he could presumably correct but from her own inability to relate to anyone On the other hand she represents all that the male finds desirable and vital so for him to be cut off from her is tantamount to not living If she rejects him it means he is not really alive and thus is an android If she accepts him it means he will be tied to her and thus exposed to the coldness he most fears Either way exposure to her compromises his humanity with a touch of an droidism a possibility brilliantly realized in Do Androids Dream through the intimation that Deckard himself may be an android The tomb world acknowledges this pollution and tries to atone for it Occasionally male characters who are constantly in danger of being sucked into the maelstrom of conflicting impulses that the schizoid android evokes take revenge on the woman who attracts them presumably with authorial sanction The violence that the narrator and behind him Dick can visit on the schizoid woman is revealed in the scene from The Three Stigmata in which Leo Bulero propositions his attractive assistant Roni Fugate a character who bears more than a passing resemblance to the schizoid woman When she turns him down Leo spitefully wishes she were old over one hundred years old Leo has consumed and been consumed Turning Realitv Inside Out I by ChewZ and so has never really left the space where Palmer Eldritch makes the rules Too late he remembers that in this delusional world his thoughts are coextensive with the apparently real landscape He turns around to see a spider web gray fungoid strands wrapped one around an other to form a brittle column that swayed  he saw the head sunken at the cheeks with eyes like dead spots of soft inert white slime that leaked out gummy slowmoving tears Aghast he wishes her alive again The gray mass becomes a puddle that flowed gradually outward then shuddered and retracted into itself in the center the fragments of hard gray matter swam together and cohered into a roughly shaped ball with tangled mat ted strands of hair floating at its crown Vague eyesockets empty formed it was becoming a skull but of some lifeformation to come his unconscious desire for her to experience evolution in its horrific aspect had conjured this monstrosity into being27 Two lessons emerge from this episode First is the connection between the schizoid woman and the tomb world here made explicit when the male who perceives himself insulted by her takes revenge by making her the vic tim of the tomb world dynamiCS Although he may be punished byperceiv ing the world as a dust heap the punishment he visits upon her is the more extreme violence of being made to incorporate within her own body the preternatually accelerated entropic decay of the tomb world The second lesson is the inescapability of a landscape in which the subjects inside has merged with the worlds outside Time can go forward again into life but it cant be reversed back to where it was before the psychotic episode hap pened for Leo or more drastically for Roni either Leo learns that one can climb out of the tomb world as Mercer eventually does but once one has fallen into it the tomb world itself never goes away It stays there waiting until the boundaries separating inside and outside again become so unsta ble that the subject slides down into it once more as Jack Bohlen does in Dicks novel Martian TimeSlip Given these complexities how does resolution occur in Dicks novels How are the endlessly complex splittings and recombinations of the schizoid android stabilized enough to achieve closure To answer this question I tum now to the staging of the schizoid android in his novel Dr Bloodmoney Turning RightSide Out in Dr Bloodrrwney In a brilliant article entitled After Armageddon Character Systems in Dr Bloodmoney Fredric Jameson uses the semiotic square to elucidate the relationships between characters in Dr Bloodrrwney28 His analysis posits a primary axis between organic and mechanical where the terms exist in an oppositional relation to each other The appearance of this axis is scarcely a surprise since the opposition between human and mechanical is a prominent theme in Dicks fiction Less obvious is the axis labeled contra dictory in which the terms are not opposites to the terms of the first axis but exist in a subtler relation of including realms that the first terms exclude The lowerright position is occupied by the notorganic which Jameson interprets as lacking organs that is as the dead and the lowerleft position is held by neither mechanical nor organic to which he assigns those char acters who possess extraordinary or spiritual powers such as talking ani mals and humans gifted with preternatural abilities Most of the major characters exist in positions synthesizing these four primary terms From this analysis it becomes clear that the characters are arranged according to their power over words or things a conclusion with important implications in these fictions where words are used to reveal the unreality of things and where things are used to reveal the instabilities in words In my view the only unconvincing part of Jamesons argument is the supposition he uses to launch his analysis He points out that Dr Blood rrwney shows the event that the other midsixties novels presume but do not depict the nuclear holocaust that destroys the environment and per manently changes the relation of the human race to Earth He argues that the bomb demands a flat yes or no thus defeating Dicks aesthetic of cre ating an indeterminate reality and requiring a newtechnique29 The char acter system he suggests is this new technique although how it works to solve the problem he posits is never made clear But Dick has no problem rendering the reality of the bomb problematic as we shall see shortly so from this point of view the character system is overkill I want to suggest on the contrary that the character system is more aptly understood in relation to a different interpretive problem one that I believe is central to the nar rative dynamics of Dr Bloodrrwney the boundary work of turning charac ters who are inside out rightside out The first time the bombs come the narrative makes clear that the event is actually taking place although significantly it is rendered through the eyes of Bruno Bluthgeld the Dr Bloodmoney of the title a theoretical physicist who convinced people that highaltitude nuclear tests would be safe His calculations proved tragically offbase and a generation of mal formed children were born as a result Now nine years later he goes by the name Mr Tree fantasizes that large disfiguring blotches under his skin mark him for those in the know and believes that there are massive con Turning Reality Inside Out I spiracies afoot to kill him Leaving the psychiatrist he has consulted to get rid of his infection which he construes physiologically but which the reader has no trouble recognizing as paranoid schizophrenia he sees the San Francisco street suddenly sink and tilt to the left He attributes the phenomenon to his astigmatism Sensedata so vital he thought Not merely what you perceive but how  Perhaps I have picked up a mild labyrinthitis a virus infection of the inner ear30 The monstrous incom mensurability between a minor ear infection and a nuclear holocaust reveals how out of whack are Bluthgelds perceptions Like other schizo phrenics in Dicks fiction he has experienced an inRation of ego so extreme that he believes he alone is responsible for everything that happens In his delirium he interprets the holocaust as a defensive measure he was forced to take to punish those conspiring against him In contrast to this first scene is the second holocaust more shadowy than real Bluthgeld now living as Mr Tree in a postnuclear society on the Marin headlands grotesquely decides that the conspiracy against him has been reactivated when Stuart McConchie arrives in the community In the afterword to Dr Bloodrrwney Dick identified McConchie an African American as representing his own viewpoint within the novel Alarmed by this fantasized conspiracy BluthgeldMr Tree concentrates on reactivat ing the destructive forces that will drop the bombs The second time around it is not so easy for us to decide the ontological status of the bomb Since many of Mr Trees other fantasies obviously dont work the reader may be tempted to dismiss his calling forth the bomb as a private delusion But other characters corroborate that some version of a nuclear hit is taking place although exactly in what sense is not clear The most important of these corroborations is the viewpoint of Walt Dangerfield a wouldbe Martian emigre trapped in a satellite after war broke out From high over Earth Dangerfield sees on the horizon a Rash that he thinks he recognizes from the holocaust nine years earlier Seconds passed and there were no further explOSions And the one he had seen it had been peculiarly vague and shadowy with a diffuseness that had made it seem somehow unreal as ifitwas only imagined p 230 Thus Dick constructs the event so it hovers suspended between internal fantasy and exterior corroboration using much the same multifocal narrative techniques that operate in his other novels Whatever the purpose of the character system its object cannot be to infect the holocaust with ontological uncertainty for Dick accomplishes this by other means So what does the character system accomplish As I suggested earlier I believe it is directed toward the different problem of how to escape be coming trapped in the inside of a p owe rmad fantasy and how to tum the world rightside out again Jameson rightly notices that Dick runs into a problem when he tries to defeat violent characters by using characters still more violent for the cure quickly becomes worse than the disease Exactly this problem arises in Dr Bloodrrwney When Mr Tree goes crazy and starts setting off bombs again Hoppy a phocomelus born with no legs with flippers for arms and with fearsome telekinetic powers saves himself and incidentally the town by killing Mr Tree tossing Mr Tree high into the air by using his telekinetic powers But Hoppy has a growing megalo mania akin to that of Bluthgeld Drunk with his powers he has no empathy for anyone else and has such an inflated ego that only his own needs and de sires are real to him Moreover his reach extends beyond the town He has been preparing himself to become the worlds dictator by using telekinesis to kill Walt Dangerfield and take over his satellite broadcasts which have hitherto provided the one bright spot in an otherwise dark world Like Mr Tree Hoppywants to locate others inside his fantasy and arrange matters so that others are forced to live there on his terms The resolution comes from another direction entirely Opposing Hoppy and Mr Tree is Edie Keller a young girl who carries the homunculus of her twin brother Bill who formed inside her body when they were in the womb and communicates with her telepathically No doubt her characterization reflects Dicks belief that he carried the spirit of Jane inside his body Edie and Bill are Dick and Jane turned inside out Whereas Mr Tree and Hoppy are completely narcissistic the confusion of boundaries that Bill and Edie experience includes genuine concern for each other Bills greatest hope is that he can exit Edies body and live on his own rather than vicariously through her reports to him Although Edie can be thoughtless and cruel she also tries earnestly to find a suitable home for him When she hears that Mr Tree has gone crazy she hurries to him reasoning that Bill will make better use of Mr Trees body But Hoppy kills Mr Tree before she can reach him Her next plan is to trick Hoppy into allowing her to get close to him so that Bill can expropriate Hoppys body But Hoppy telepathic as well as telekinetic takes Bill out of her body before she can reach the phocomelus he tosses Bills tiny malformed body into the air as he did with Bluthgeld Bill however has authorial resources that Bluthgeld lacked Tongue in cheek Dick uses an avis ex rnachina to rescue Bill Bill succeeds in ex changing bodies with Hoppy seconds before the homunculus body dies In contrast to Hoppys megalomania Bills aspirations are modest Although Hoppys body is severely deformed it is so superior to Bills previous body that he is delighted with it for now he can see and hear on his own Thus the Turning Realiry Inside Our  insideoutside confusion is resolved in two ways Bluthgeld and Hoppy the characters who threatened to expand until others were condemned to live in the inside of their horrific mental worlds are killed and Bill and Edie innocents who through no fault of their own were caught in a tragic encap sulation that threatened both their lives are turned rightside out The happy conclusion reverses the tragic end of Dick and Janes twinship In stead of two children becoming one when the girl twin dies here one child becomes two when the boy twin succeeds in leaving his sisters body and liv ing on his own Why can this accommodation be achieved in Dr Bloodmoney when it eludes the other midsixties novels with their darker endings Central to this extremely hopeful novel Dicks phrase in the afterword p 300 is the characterization of Bonny Keller who remains largely outside J arne sons semiotic square Depicted as a beautiful woman Bonny is one of the very few attractive females who is neither fetishized as the darkhaired girl nor feared as the schizoid woman in Dicks fiction Her deepest allegiance seems to be toward living life as fully honestly and joyfully as pOSSible The day the bombs fall her immediate reaction is to make love with the first man who comes along Andrew Gill as if to affirm that life can still go on As a result Edie and Bill are conceived As if to confirm that she is emphatic as well as lifeaffirming her next reaction is to weep for all the people who have died in the city Bonnys moment of truth comes Significantly when she refuses to take responsibility any longer for Bluthgelds madness Throughout the years she has tried to protect him and even to reason with him but when his mad ness breaks through again she leaves him to his folly She has a similar re action when Hoppy starts terrorizing the town Rather than fight him she intends to get as far away as pOSSible Somehow her shrugging off these self aSSigned responsibilities comes across as the right thing to do even though it means leaving her children behind Talking with Dr Stockwell Bill won ders what his mother will think when she realizes she has twins rather than a Single child But he and his sister never find out for Bonny has already run off with Andrew Gill The Gordian knot formed by the tangled complexi ties of mothers who cannot properly care for their children of twins whose lives enmesh with disastrous results and of vicious circles that form when a male character both desires and fears the darkhaired girlschizoid woman is Simply cut through by a knifelike clarity that says in effect This mess is not my responsibility I have my own life to lead Jameson remarks that one of the purposes the character system serves is a freshening of the world whereby commodified products that used to be 184  Chapter Seven taken for granted become homemade luxuries that bring delight and plea sure to the lives of those who consume them This redemption of capital ism the refusal of the double bind of the darkhaired girl schizoid woman the destruction of those who would engorge themselves so that they can forcibly encapsulate others in their inside the turning right side out of a tragically enfolded twin boy and girl the choice for life over futile self assigned and selfdefeating responsibilitiesthese are the entwined com plexities that the elaborate textual machinery of the character system is designed to straighten out More so than other texts from this period with the possible exception of Martian TimeSlip Dr Bloodrrwney succeeds in cutting through the entanglements figured by schizoid android As Dick moved out of the midsixties era the frequency with which the darkhaired girlschizoid woman appears in his fiction diminishes Ubik written at the outer range of this period in 1966 functions as an interesting transitional text for it suggests that Dick was able to resolve the deep ambi guities of the darkhaired girlschizoid woman configuration through his writing Structured as a series of revelations each of which exposes its pre decessor as a facade rather than an authentic reality Ubik uses this favorite Dickian technique to suggest that the darkhaired girlschizoid woman configuration is itself merely a facade underlaid by a deeper reality To see how Dick achieves this psychological resolution let us turn now to this complexly reflexive text DarkHaired GirlSchizoid Woman as Facade The Reality Underneath In Ubik the struggle to occupy an outside relative to someone elses in side takes place on multiple levels The little guy of the novel Joe Chip works for Glen Runciter head of a prudence organization that specializes in antipsis who can neutralize the psionic talents of telepaths precogs and the like Lured to Luna by a business rival Glen Runciter Joe Chip and a group of their antipsis are hit by a bomb What happens afterward is notOriously unclear For a while Joe believes that Glen has been fatally in jured and he and his team rush back to Earth to put Glen in cryogenic sus pension where the little life force that remains can be stretched out into several years of half life in a moratorium a neologism that points toward the liminal state that halflifers occupy as they hover suspended between life and death No sooner does Joe return to Earth however than he finds the world around him manifesting preternaturally rapid decay Unlike ear lier protagonists who accepted the tomb world as reality Joe puzzles over Turning Reality Inside Out  where the boundaries between inside and outside should be drawn It is nt the universe which is being entombed he thinks All this is going on within me and yet I seem to see it outside  Is the whole world inside me Engulfed by my body31 The mystery seems to clear when he re ceives messages inscribed on various mediarecorded telephone calls matchbook covers parking citations bathroom graffitiimplying that it was he and his team who were fatally injured in the explosion In this ver sion of reality Runciter is outside in a moratorium trying to communicate with those inside the world of dreaming halflifers Although this explanation may account for the messages Joe does not understand how it relates to the decay and regression which soon attack people as well as objects The woman he aspires to marry Wendy Wright who at first looks so durable that he cant imagine her agingshe had too much control over herself and outside reality for that p 55he later finds desiccated in his closet a huddled heap dehydrated almost mum mified p 90 He suspects that the culprit causing this disastrous intrusion of the entropic tomb world into his reality is Pat Conley a dev astatingly attractive woman with a lithe body telltale dark eyes and long black hair p 31 Pat is particularly dangerous because she can change what happened in the past thus creating a different present and more over a present that other people do not realize is not the same present as the one they were living in a moment ago After several members of Joes party turn into desiccated heaps the decay attacks him As he crawls up the stairs to his room heroically struggling so that he can die in decent privacy Pat taunts him and gloats over his imminent demise revealing herself as a particularly vicious instantiation of the schizoid woman The thing we call Pat Joe Significantly names her in this moment of confrontation p 159 Yet this signing of the darkhaired girl as an android a spectacle that in ear lier texts had proved so obseSSively engrossing that it derailed the plot wit ness We Can Build You here is revealed as a mere facade behind which stands a more authentic reality The real culprit responsible for the desic cation Joe discovers is not Pat but the teenage Jory characterized princi pally by his voracious appetite for life Condemned to halflife while still an adolescent Jory maintains his crude but vibrant vitality by feeding on the life force of halflifers weaker than himself I eat their life what remains of it Jory tells Joe Chip when he is exposed I need a lot of them 1 used to wait until they had been in halflife awhile but now 1 have to have them im mediately p 174 If part of Dicks fascination with the schizoid womandarkhaired girl comes from his guilt over Janes death Jorys unveiling moves toward un 186  Chapter Seven tangling the complexities of the darkhaired girlschizoid android configu ration for it brings into view the child who performs the fantasized act of eating what others need to survive The Hat horror that attends J orys canni balistic appetite recalls Dicks teenage phobia of eating in public When Joe hears that Jory consumes his victims he recoils in horror How do you mean ate Literally he wondered his Hesh undulating with aversion the gross physical motion rolled through him engulfing him as ifhis body wanted to shrink away p 173 He learns firsthand what J ory does when the youngster leaps at him Even though the perceived actions must be happening symbolically rather than literally in halflife each person is cryogenically suspended in his or her individual container so physical as sault is impossible the description of the attack is vividly animalistic and horrific Snarling Jory bit him The great shovel teeth fastened into Joes right hand They hung on as meanwhile Jory raised his head lifting Joes hand with his jaw J ory stared at him with unwinking eyes snoring wetly as he tried to close his jaws pp 17576 The intensity of Dicks revulsion here is unmistakable Nevertheless J ory finds a measure of absolution as if Dick recognized that J ory is only do ingwhat he must to survive Ella Runciter Glens wife who entered halflife at age twentytwo and who is described as pretty lightskinned and blueeyed in the tradition of Bonny Keller acts like the mother that Dick might have wished he had She insists God knows I detest Jory But she also accepts Jory and his kind as a condition oflife seeing his preying on others as a verity a rule of our kind oflife She urges Joe to come to terms with J orys predation insisting that moving to a new site wont help because there are Jorys in every moratorium When Joe insists that he wants to defeat Jory she cautions I doubt if you can truly destroy himin other words consume himas he does to halflifers placed near him in the mora torium p 183 The language makes clear that consuming the predator cannot be a final solution for the only way to achieve this illusory closure is by taking the predator inside thus symbolically and literally becoming a predator oneself As in Dicks other novels from this period the psychological interpene trates the social and the economic It comes as no surprise then that Jorys appetite is also linked with the relentless capitalism that preempts the be ginning of each chapter with a commercial for Ubik When Joe asks Ella why Jory cant simply be phYSically removed from proximity with the half lifers he preys on she replies Herbert the moratorium owner is paid a great deal of money annually by Jorys family to keep him with the others and to think up plaUSible reasons for doing so p 183 In the commercials Turning Realitv Inside Out  that selVe as epigraphs for the chapters Ubik signifies all manner of capi talist predation from used cars to foods accompanied by the ominous dis claimer Safe when used as directed As in Dr Bloodrrwney resolution of a personal crisis is mysteriously linked with the redemption of capitalism even though resolution in the economic sphere is not logically motivated in the plot Thus when J OJ is revealed and accepted as an inevitability the meaning of Ubik is mysteriously changed as well In the final epigraph we find the following proclamation I am Ubik Before the universe was I am  I cre ated the lives and the places they inhabit I move them here I put them there They go as I say they do as I tell them  I am called Ubik but that is not my name I am I shall always be p 190 When Joe Chip discovers Ella as the force opposingJory and muses Ive reached the last entities in volved she replies caustically I dont think of myself as an entity I usu ally think of myself as Ella Runciter p 182 Now the unlocatable voice speaking the epigraph seems to reveal itself as the final entity To my knowledge no one has attempted to explain why Ubik changes from signi fying the worst excesses of capitalism to standing for a ubiquitous God Many critics even suggest that Ubik has somehow really been God all along I want to suggest that on the contrary Ubik undergoes a sudden transformation and that this transformation cannot be understood except in relation to the revelation that behind Pat stands Jory and behind Jory stands his animalistic appetite Only after acknowledging this appetite which must be understood as operating on the multiple levels Signified by consuming can the author discern among the trashy surfaces of capital ist excess the divine within the worldand by implication within himself For ifUbikis intended to signifY an ultimate authentic reality it can do so only from a perspective inside the text Outside the text let us suppose Derrida notwithstanding that we can imagine such a vantage Ubik must be none other than Philip K Dick It is ultimately Dick who created the lives and the places the characters inhabit who put them there in this text Confused about where Ubik comes from Joe at first assumes that Runciter has smuggled it to him but Jory insists that no objects can come into the halflife world from the outside only words The distinction be tween words and things encoded into the character system of Dr Blood money is here invoked to remind us of the difference between resolution in fictional worlds where writing has efficacy only in the performative realm of symbolic action and resolution in the real world where the materiality of things is often stubbornly resistant to verbal intelVentions This split be tween words and things maps onto the split in Dicks life between past and 188  Chaprer Seven present sedimented psychological formation and present active intention Ifhe is writing his way toward resolving deep conflicts in his life he can do so through words that have only a mediated and uncertain relation to the ghosts inhabiting his psyche As a writer he passes messages through his fiction into his own heart of darkness hoping that somehow they might prove efficacious Within the world of the text the murmurs the halflifers hear from the world outside trope this situation for no things can pass be tween inside and outside only words Joe Chip seems to comment on this aspect of Dicks writing when he remarks from his perspective in half life We are served by organic ghosts  who speaking and writing pass through this our new environment Watching wise phYSical ghosts from the fulllife world elements of which have become for us invading but agreeable splinters of a substance that pulsates like a former heart pp18889 Ubiks distinctive achievement is to represent Simultaneously the per formative power oflanguage and the mediated uncertain relation oflan guage to the material world while also mapping this difference onto an inside outside boundary that hints at the complexity of communication between self and other conscious and unconscious The hope Ubik holds out is that although boundary disputes will never disappear inside and out side can be made to touch each other through the medium of a writing that is no less valuable for infecting our world with all manner of epistemologi cal and ontolOgical instabilities Punctuating the Endless Regress of Reflexivity Like Maturana and Varela Dick is a system builder He takes seriously an idea they also propose follOwing SpencerBrown thatthe observer cre ates a system by drawing a distinction between inside and outside For Maturana and Varela this move introduced certain instabilities into the foundation of their system instabilities that they sought to fix by locating the formation of the system boundaries in reality as such For Dick such instabilities have potentially deadly consequences as subjects struggle to define boundaries that are outside relative to others inside Consis tent with their base in the biological sciences Maturana and Varela tend to assume rational observers The observer they posit is the kind of ob server who sits in a laboratory watching an instrument dial Granting con structive power to the observer may be epistemolOgically radical but it is not necessarily politically or psychologically radical for the rational ob server can be assumed to exercise restraint Dick makes no such assump Turning Realiry Inside Our  tion His conclusions are darker and more psychologically complex be cause he is acutely aware of cases in which the stability of the observing mind cannot be assumed especially when the act of creating a world may stimulate an already insatiable appetite for power and selfexpansion Thus Dick uses the inclusion of the observer to opposite effect Whereas Maturana and Varela use the domain of the observer to recuperate everyday notions like cause and effect Dick uses it to estrange further consensus reality Similarly Dick shares with secondwave cybernetics an emphasis on re flexivity though he changes its use and intent Maturana sought to rescue the reflexivity inherent in autopoiesis from an infinite regress by asserting We do not see what we do not see and what we do not see does not exist 32 The infinite regress of observers watching other observers is thus con tained for the reflexive spiral does not continue past the boundaries of the observer Sharing Maturanas passion for systems Dick used a different strategy Instead of bracketing reality he turned to the creation of ever more inclusive systems His most ambitious attempt at system creation sprang from a series of visionary experiences he had in February and March of 1974 dates that he abbreviated as 2374 To explain these experiences he wrote a vast tract entitled Exegesis that ran to more than three thou sand pages in length selections of which have been published There is a possible phYSiological explanation skeptically entertained by Dicks biographer Lawrence Sutin and embraced by others for the visions of 237433 Within eight years Dick would die of a massive stroke and throughout this period he had extreme hypertension The visions he expe rienced are consistent with symptoms experienced by people who have had small strokes in the brain which can stimulate the auditory centers and cause hallucinations Dick himself was skeptical of the visions and enter tained numerous hypotheses about them As if to make good Maturanas as sertion that there can be no difference between a hallucination and reality for one who experiences the hallucination34 Dick finally concluded that the most likely explanation was that he had been contacted by an extrater restrial intelligence he called the Vast Active Living Intelligent System or VALIS the subject of a final trilogy of novels that are among the best of his fiction On November 17 1980 he had another visionary experience in which he believed God contacted him directly For Dick the contact solved the problem of infinite regress that inevitably haunts reflexive con structions Wherever a regress appeared the voice claimed that Dick had encountered the infinite therefore the divine therefore God Here is Dicks account of the experience as it is recorded in ExegeSis God said I am the infinite 1 will show you Where 1 am infinity is where in finity is there 1 am Construct lines of reasoning by which to understand your experience in 1974 1 will enter the field against their shifting nature You think they are lOgical but they are not they are infinitely creative came into being God said Here 1 am here is infinity 1 thought another ex planation again an infinite series of thoughts split off in dialectical antithetical interaction God said Here is infinity here I am35 For Dick the construction of the observer cannot finally be separated from the construction of reality Both end at the same point in infinite regresses that for mystical reasons he chose to call God rather than a Maturanian re ality that remains outside the compass of human knowing In this way Dick constructs an outside authorized with the name of God and made invul nerable by continuing to infinity an outside that is safe from being coopted and forced to become an inside The irony of course is that this very con struction may itself have been precipitated by a physical event inside his brain In contrast to the ambitious system building that Dick undertook in re sponse to the visions of 2374 his fiction of the midsixties tends toward a different kind of affirmation one that I find more appealing It can be illus trated by the ending of Do Androids Dream After Deckard succeeds in killing the last three androids on his list and returns home to find out that Rachael has pushed his beloved goat off the roof he is so exhausted and de moralized that he heads for the desolate country north of San Francisco where no living thing would go Not unless it felt thatthe end had come36 There he has a visionary experience Hundreds of miles from his govern ment sanctioned empathy box he feels a rock hit him as he stands on top of a dead hill as ifhe were enacting Mercers endless scenario Panicked he calls the office on the car phone and tells his secretary Im Wilbur Mercer Ive permanently fused with him And I cant unfuse p 207 Here the ex pansion of the ego comes not from megalomania but from suffering and in ner conflict a result of the empathy that Deckard has increasingly come to feel for the androids Psychologically if not intellectually he has refused the distinctions that make androids fair game for bounty hunters The fusion experience ends only when he spies a toad an animal sacred to Mercer halfburied in the lifeless dust Awed by his discovery he takes it as a sign that he is meant to go on living When he returns home to Iran his wife and shows her the toad she dis covers the trap door hidden in its belly It is electrical like the ersatz sheep Turning Reality Inside Out I with which he tried to fool his neighbors The sign is a delusion the miracle is a fake But this ironic tum is not quite the end He tells Iran that the delu sion doesnt matter The electric things have their lives too PaltI as those lives are p 214 When Iran tells him to dial Long deserved peace on the mood organ he agrees but falls asleep without it finding peace without needing a cybernetic benediction She then orders artificial flies for the electric toad to eat showing a tenderness toward her husband that was notably lacking at the beginning of the novel Although nothing has hap pened to explain how she moved from bitterness to tenderness it is as if Deckards struggle with the schizoid android has somehow resolved ten sions in their relationship as well The symbolic way in which resolution oc curs emphasizes that no big problems are solved here Only a modest accommodation has been reached infused with multiple ironies that em phasizes survival and the mixed condition of humans who are at their best when they show tolerance and affection for the creatures biological and mechanical with whom they share the planet One could do worse than to accept this as a fitting conclusion to the deep epistemological and ethical problems that secondwave cybernetics raised but did not conclusively solve  Chap  ter  fIgh  t THE MATERIALITY OF INFORMATICS Every epoch has beliefs widely accepted by contemporaries that appear fantastic to later generations Of such are New Historical studies made with good reason for understanding the constellation of practices meta phors and presuppositions that underlie apparently bizarre beliefs opens a window onto a cultures ideology One contemporary belieflikelyto stupefY future generations is the postmodern orthodoxy that the body is primarily if not entirely a linguistic and discursive construction Coincident with cybernetiC developments that stripped information of its body were discursive analyses within the humanities especially the archaeology of knowledge pioneered by Michel Foucault that saw the body as a play of discourse systems Although researchers in the physical and human sci ences acknowledged the importance of materiality in different ways they nevertheless collaborated in creating the postmodem ideology that the bodys materiality is secondary to the lOgical or semiotic structures it en codes It is not difficult to find pronouncements supporting an ideology of dis embodiment in cultural theory no less than in cybernetiCS Consider for example the follOwing claims The human body our body seems super fluous in its proper expanse in the complexity and multiplicity ofits organs of its tissue and functions because today everything is concentrated in the brain and the genetic code which alone sum up the operational definition of being Jean Baudrillard wrote in The Ecstasy of Communication l Arthur Kroker and Marilouise Kraker out Baudrillard Baudrillard in Body Invaders Panic Sex in America imagining secondorder simulacra and floating body parts that herald the disappearance of the body into a fluid and changing display of signs If today there can be such an intense fasci nation with the fate of the body might this not be because the body no 19 2 The Materiality of Informatics  longer exists they ask in what they evidently believe is a rhetorical ques tion They count the ways the body is disappearing ideologically into the signs of fashion epistemologically as the Cartesian consciousness guaran teeing its existence falls apart that grisly and false sense of subjectivity semiotically into tattoos and floating signs and technologically into ultra refuse and hyperfunctionality2 O B Hardison concludes his disap pearing act by writing the body into computers He penSively observes N 0 matter what precautions are taken no matter how lucky the body is in the end it betrays itself Echoing Hans Moravec he imagines the relation between carbon man and the silicon devices he is creating to be like the relation between the caterpillar and the iridescent winged creature that the caterpillar unconSCiously prepares to become3 How can we account for these ecstatic pronouncements and delirious dreams As I suggested in chapters 1 and 2 I believe they should be taken as evidence not that the body has disappeared but that a certain kind of sub jectivity has emerged This subjectivity is constituted by the crossing of the materiality of informatics with the immateriality of information4 The very theorists who most emphatically claim that the body is disappearing also operate within material and cultural circumstances that make the claim for the bodys disappearance seem plausible The bodys dematerialization de pends in complex and highly speCific ways on the embodied circumstances that an ideology of dematerialization would obscure Excavating these con nections requires a way of talking about the body responsive to its con struction as discourselinformation and yet not trapped within it This chapter suggests a new more flexible framework in which to think about embodiment in an age of virtuality This framework comprises two dynam ically interacting polarities The first polarity unfolds as an interplay be tween the body as a cultural construct and the experiences of embodiment that individual people within a culture feel and articulate The second po larity can be understood as a dance between inscribing and incorporating practices Since the body and embodiment inscription and incorporation are in constant interaction the distinctions forming these polarities are heuristic rather than absolute They nevertheless play an important role in understanding the connections between an ideology of immateriality and the material conditions that produce the ideology Thus one purpose of this chapter is to develop a theoretical framework to integrate the two camps of abstraction and embodiment that have been sitting uneasily side by side since my discussion of the Macy Conferences A second purpose is to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework for reading texts William BurroughsS The Ticket That Exploded serves as my example in part because Burroughs turns the tables on those who advocate disembodiment Instead of discourse dematerializing the body in Ticket the body materializes discourse Situating this text in the high technology for its time of magnetic taperecording I demonstrate how the theoreti cal framework can be used to foreground embodiment while still being at tentive to the complexities of representational codes To prepare the ground for these discussions let us tum now to a brief consideration of Foucaults archaeology and its treatment of embodiment Foucaults Archaeology and the Erasure of Embodiment Acknowledging thatthe Panopticon was never built Foucault nevertheless argues that it must not be understood as a dream building it is the diagram of a mechanism of power reduced to its ideal form its functioning ab stracted from any obstacle resistance or friction must be represented as a pure architectural and optical system it is in fact a figure of political tech nologythat may and must be detached from any specific use5 On the one hand the abstraction of the Panopticon beyond any obstacle resistance or friction into a system of diSciplines dispersed throughout society gives Foucaults analysis its power and universality On the other hand it diverts attention away from how actual bodies in their cultural and phYSical speci ficities impose incorporate and resist incorporation of the material prac tices he describes It is not coincidental that the Panopticon abstracts power out of the bod ies of disciplinarians into a universal disembodied gaze On the contrary it is precisely this move that gives the Panopticon its force for when the bod ies of the diSciplinarians seem to disappear into the technology the limita tions of corporeality are hidden Although the bodies of the diSciplined do not disappear in Foucaults account the specificities of their corporealities fade into the technology as well becoming a universalized body worked upon in a uniform way by surveillance techniques and practices When ac tual situations involving embodied agents are considered limits appear that are obscured when the Panopticon is considered only as an abstract mechanism Failing to recognize these limits Foucaults analysis rein scribes as well as challenges the presuppositions of the Panoptic society Foucault thus participates in as well as deconstructs the Panoptic move of disembodiment Exposing the assumptions underlying Panoptic society his analysis also fetishistically reconstructs them by positing a body consti tuted through discursive formations and material practices that erase the contextual enactments embodiment always entails6 A useful antidote to The MaterialilY of Informatics  this view is Elaine Scarrys study of torture in The Body in Pain The Making and Unmaking of the World 7 Like Foucault Scarry interrogates the cul tural assumptions and political purposes that underlie the use of torture also like Foucault when she talks about assaults on the body she uses rep resentations to bring them into the realm of discourse what other choice could there be But unlike Foucaults discussions her representations are crafted to emphaSize that bodily practices have a physical reality that can never be fully assimilated into discourse Although the absorption of embodiment into discourse imparts inter pretive power to Foucault it also limits his analysis in Significant ways Many commentators have criticized the universality of the Foucaultian body this universality is a direct result of concentrating on discourse rather than embodiment Fissuring along lines of class gender race and privi lege embodied practices create heterogeneous spaces even when the dis cursive formations describing those practices seem uniformly dispersed throughout the society The assimilation of embodiment into discourse has the additional disadvantage of making it difficult to understand exactly how certain practices spread through a society Foucault delineates the trans formations that occurred when corporeal punishment gave way to surveil lance but the engine driving these changes remains obscure Focusing on embodiment would help to clarify the mechanisms of change for it links a changing technological landscape with the instantiated enactments that create feedback loops between materiality and discourse Building on Foucaults work while going beyond it requires understanding how em bodiment moves in conjunction with inscription technology and ideology Attentive to discursive constructions such an analysiS would also examine how embodied humans interact with the material conditions in which they are placed Elizabeth Grosz makes a good start in her valuable study Volatile Bodies Toward a Corporeal Feminism 9 She argues that the mindbody split pervasive in the Western tradition is so bound up with philosophical thinking that philosophy literally cannot conceive of itself as having a body Philosophy has always considered itself a diSCipline concerned primarily or exclUSively vith ideas concepts reason judgment that is ith terms clearly framed by the concept of mind terms which marginalize or exclude considerations of the body p 4 Even those philosophers who do take embodiment seriously tend unreflectingly to take the male body as the norm as Grosz shows in discussing a range of theorists including Merleau Ponty Freud Lacan Nietzsche Foucault and Deleuze and Guattari Reading these male writers to find resources for a feminist understanding of embodiment she offers as a model a Mobius strip in which outside be comes inside becomes outside The attraction of the model for her is that it undercuts dichotomies by having one tum into the other So she structures her book by first showing how models of the psyche produce the body the inside out and then how the body produces the psyche the outside in En route to this analysis she makes an important observation Indeed there is no body as such there are only bodiesmale or female black brown white large or smalland the gradations in between Bodies can be represented or understood not as entities in themselves or simply on a linear continuum with its polar extremes occupied by male and female bodies  but as a field a twodimensional continuum in which race and possibly even class caste or religion form body specifications p 19 Al though I am fully sympathetic with Groszs project the Mobius strip model has limitations as she recognizes pp 20910 In particular the imper ceptible transformations of insideoutside make it difficult to chart grada tions within the continuum It seems to me that the field in which bodies take shape may profitably be represented as an interplay between two in tersecting axes The polarities defining the end points of the axes acknowl edge the historical importance of dichotomies but the field itself is generated by the interplay between these end points To delineate this field let me begin by clarifying what I mean byembod iment an understanding that aligns itself with Groszs comment that there is no body as such there are only bodies Embodiment differs from the concept of the body in thatthe body is always normative relative to some set of criteria To explore how the body is constructed within Renaissance medical discourse for example is to investigate the normative assump tions used to constitute a particular kind of social and discursive concept Normalization can also take place with someones particular experiences of embodiment converting the heterogeneous flux of perception into a rei fied stable object In contemporary scientific visualization technologies such as positronemission tomography PET for example embodiment is converted into a body through imaging technologies that create a normal ized construct averaged over many data pOints to give an idealized version of the object in question 10 In contrast to the body embodiment is contex tual enmeshed within the specifics of place time phYSiology and culture which together compose enactment Embodiment never coincides exactly with the body however that normalized concept is understood Whereas the body is an idealized form that gestures toward a Platonic reality em bodiment is the specific instantiation generated from the noise of differ ence Relative to the body embodiment is other and elsewhere at once The Materiality of Informatics I excessive and deficient in its infinite variations particularities and abnor malities During any given period experiences of embodiment are in continual interaction with constructions of the body Consider for example the stress put on the vaginal orgasm during the early part of the twentieth cen tury across a range of cultural sites from Freudian psychoanalysis to the novels of D H Lawrence Womens experiences of embodiment inter acted with this concept in a variety of ways Some women disciplined their experiences to bring them into line with the concept others registered their experiences as defective because they were other than the concept still others were skeptical about the concept because it did not match their experiences Experiences of embodiment far from existing apart from cul ture are always already imbricated within it Yet because embodiment is individually articulated there is also at least an incipient tension between it and hegemonic cultural constructs Embodiment is thus inherently desta bilizing with respect to the body for at any time this tension can widen into a perceived disparity Foucault is not exceptional in focUSing on the body rather than embodi ment Most theorists who write on corporeality make the same choice for theory by its nature seeks to articulate general patterns and overall trends rather than individual instantiations Theorieslike numbers require acer tain level of abstraction and generality to work A theory that did not gener alize would be like the number scheme that Jorge Luis Borges imagines in Funes the Memoriousll Funes blessed or cursed by a head injury that enables him to remember each sensation and thought in all its particularity and uniqueness proposes that each number be aSSigned a unique nonsys tematic name bearing no relation to the numbers that come before and af ter it If embodiment could be articulated separate from the bodyan impossibility for several reasons not least because articulation system atizes and normalizes experiences in the act of naming themit would be like Funess numbers a froth of discrete utterances registering the contin uous and infinite play of difference Yet there are theories like this one that abstractly and generally insist on the importance of the particular Michel de Certeau for example provides a useful corrective to Foucault in pointing to the importance of individual articulations of cultural appropriations 12 Embodiment is akin to articula tion in that it is inherently performative subject to individual enactments and therefore always to some extent improvisational Whereas the body can disappear into information with scarcely a murmur of protest embod iment cannot for it is tied to the circumstances of the occasion and the per son As soon as embodiment is acknowledged the abstractions of the Panopticon disintegrate into the particularities of specific people embed dedin specific contexts Along with these particularities come concomitant strategies for resistances and subversions excesses and deviations It is primarily the body that is naturalized within a culture embodiment becomes naturalized only secondarily through its interactions with con cepts of the body Consequently when theorists uncover the ideolOgical underpinnings of naturalization they denaturalize the body rather than embodiment As the example of Foucault illustrates itis possible to decon struct the content of the abstraction while still leaving the mechanism of ab straction intact Moving out of the frictionless and disembodied realm of abstraction requires articulating embodiment and the body together How can this articulation be accomplished without simply absorbing embodi ment back into the body One possibility is to complicate and enrich the tension between embodi ment and the body by juxtaposing this tension with another binary distinc tioninscription and incorporationthat partly converges and partly diverges from it I envision these two bimodalities acting in complex synco pation with each other like two sine waves moving at different frequencies and with different periods of repetition How does the inscriptionincor poration coupling relate to bodyembodiment Like the body inscription is normalized and abstract in the sense that it is usually considered as a sys tem of signs operating independently of any particular manifestation In Foucaults analysis of Linnaeuss biolOgical taxonomies it does not matter whether the taxonomies were Originally printed in Gothic or Roman type their significance derives from the concepts they express not from the medium in which they appear When the concepts are transported from one medium to another for instance by being cited in Foucaults text and thus printed in a different typeface the original medium disappears from sight Moreover even the awareness that the original medium has disap peared is erased by the implicit assumption that Linnaeuss words have been exactly reproduced Such writing practices are so common that we do not normally attend to them I foreground them now to point out that they constitute inscription as a conceptual abstraction rather than as an instanti ated materiality In contrast to inscription is incorporation An incorporating practice such as a goodbye wave cannot be separated from its embodied medium for it exists as such only when it is instantiated in a particular hand making a particular kind of gesture It is pOSSible of course to abstract a sign from the embodied gesture by representing it in a different medium for The Materiality of Informatics I example by drawing on a page the outline of a stylized hand with wavy lines indicating motion In this case however the gesture is no longer an incorporating practice Rather it has been transformed precisely into an inscription that functions as if it were independent of any particular in stantiation This line of thought leads to the follOwing homology as the body is to embodiment so inscription is to incorporation Just as embodiment is in constant interplay with the body so incorporating practices are in constant interplay with inscriptions that abstract the practices into signs When the focus is on the body the particularities of embodiment tend to fade from view similarly when the focus is on inscription the particularities ofincor po ration tend to fade from view Conversely when the focus shifts to em bodiment a specific material experience emerges out of the abstraction of the body just as the particularities of an incorporating practice emerge out of the abstraction of inscription Embodiment cannot exist without a mate rial structure that always deviates in some measure from its abstract repre sentations an incorporating practice cannot exist without an embodied creature to enact it a creature who always deviates in some measure from the norms One path into further understanding the articulation between embodiment and the body then is to explore the connection between in scribing and incorporating practices Incorporating Practices and Embodied Knowledge The distinction between incorporating and inscribing practices a distinc tion implicit in Maurice MerleauPontys Phenomenology of Percep tion 13has been developed further by Paul Connerton in How Societies Remember Following Connerton I mean by an incorporating practice an action that is encoded into bodily memory by repeated performances until it becomes habitual Learning to type is an incorporating practice as both Connerton and MerleauPontyobserve When we say that someone knows how to type we do not mean that the person can cognitively map the loca tion of the keys or can understand the mechanism producing the marks Rather we mean that this person has repeatedly performed certain actions until the keys seem to be extensions of his or her fingers Someone can know how to type but not know how to read the words produced such as when a typist reproduces script in a language that the typist does not speak conversely just as someone can be able to read a typescript without know ing how to type The bodys competencies and skills are distinct from dis course although in some contexts they can produce discourse or can be 200  Chapter Eight read discursively This is Connertons point when he The Materiality of Informatics I contextual components of incorporation give it qualities that are distinc tively different from those of inscription Just as incorporating practices are not necessarily more natural than inscribing practices so embodiment is not more essentialist than the body Indeed it is difficult to see what essentialism would mean in the context of embodiment Essentialism is normative in its impulse denoting qualities or attributes shared by all human beings Though it is true that all humans share embodiment embodied experience is dispersed along a spectrum of possibilities Which possibilities are activated depends on the contexts of enactment so that no one position is more essential than any other For similar reasons embodiment does not imply an essentialist self As Fran cisco Varela Evan Thompson and Eleanor Rosch argue in The Embodied Mind a coherent continuous essential self is neither necessary nor suffi cient to explain embodied experience16 The closer one comes to the flux of embodiment Varela and his coauthors believe the more one is aware that the coherent self is a fiction invented out of panic and fear In this view em bodiment subversively undercuts essentialism rather than reinforces it If embodiment is not essentialist it is also not algOrithmic This conclu sion has important implications for debates over what difference embodi ment makes to thinking and learning In What Computers Cant Do Hubert Dreyfus argues that many human behaviors cannot be formalized in a heuristic program for a digital computer because these behaviors are embodied For Dreyfus embodiment means that humans have available to them a mode ofleaming and hence of intellection different from that de riving from cogitation alone He gives the example of a child learning to pick up a cup The child need not have an analytic understanding of the mo tor responses and dynamiCS involved in this action the child need only flail around until managing to connect Then to learn the action to be able to perform it at will the child only has to repeat what was done before At no point does the child have to break down the action into analytical compo nents or explicit instructions The advantage of this kind ofleaming is that everything does not need to be specified in advance Moreover the learning can be structured into complex relations without the necessity of a formal recognition that the re lations exist Drawing from Maurice MerleauPonty Karl Polanyi Jean Piaget and other phenomenologists Dreyfus delineates three functions that are characteristic of embodied learning and are not present in com puter programs an inner horizon that consists of a partly determined partly open context of anticipation the global character of the anticipation which relates itto other pertinent contexts in fluid shifting patterns of con zoz I Chapter Eight nection and the transferability of such anticipation from one sense modal ity to another 17 One implication of this view of embodied learning is that humans know much more than they consciously realize they know An other is that this embodied knowledge may not be completely formaliz able since the openness of the horizon allows for ambiguities and new permutations that cannot be programmed into explicit decision proce dures As we shall see in chapter 9 this provides researchers in mobile ro botics such as Rodney Brooks with an argument for the superiority of mobile embodied robots over computer programs which have no capac ity to move about and explore the environment In ways Dreyfus did not an ticipate artificiallife researchers have moved closer to his position than to the artificialintelligence research programs that he argues against A further implication of embodied interaction with the environment is developed by Pierre Bourdieu He argues that even if one is successful in reducing some area of embodied knowledge to analytical categories and explicit procedures one has in the process changed the kind of knowledge itis for the fluid contextual interconnections that define the open horizons of embodied interactions would have solidified into discrete entities and sequential instructions He makes this point that largely unnoticed and unacknowledged changes occur when embodied knowledge is expressed through analytical schemain his discussion of the seasonal rituals of the Kabyle a group of Berber tribes living in Algeria and Tunisia The calendar that the Kabyle enact through improvisational embodied practices is not the same calendar that the anthropologist extracts in schematic form from data provided by informants Whereas the anthropologists schema will show fields houses and calendars arranged according to such dualities as hot and cold male and female for the Kabyle this knowledge exists not as abstractions but as patterns of daily life learned by practicing actions until they become habitual Abstraction thus not only affects how one describes learning but also changes the account of what is learned Bourdieus work illustrates how embodied knowledge can be structur ally elaborate conceptually coherent and durably installed without ever having to be cognitively recognized as such Through observation and rep etition the child attains a practical mastery of the claSSificatory schemes which in no way implies symboliC mastery By transposing terms of sym metry relations the child is able to grasp the rationale of what Bourdieu calls the habitus a word coined to recall the habitual nature of embodied actions defined as the durably installed generative principle of regu lated improvisations18 The habitus which is learned perpetuated and The Materialitv of Informatics  changed through embodied practices should not be thought of as a collec tion of rules but as a series of dispositions and inclinations that are both subject to circumstances and durable enough to pass down through gener ations The habitus is conveyed through the orientation and movement of the body as it traverses cultural spaces and experiences temporal rhythms For the Kabyle the spatial arrangements of home village and field instan tiate the dichotomies that serve as generative principles stimulating impro visation within the regulated exchanges defined by the habitus Living in these spaces and participating in their organization form the body in char acteristic ways which in tum provides a matrix of permutations for thought and action To look at thought in this way is to tum Descartes upside down The cen tral premise is not that the cogitating mind can be certain only of its ability to be present to itself but rather that the body exists in space and time and that through its interaction with the environment it defines the parame ters within which the cogitating mind can arrive at certainties which not coincidentally almost never include the fundamental homologies generat ing the boundaries of thought What counts as knowledge is also radically revised for conscious thought becomes an epiphenomenon corresponding to the phenomenal base the body provides In Eye and Mind MerleauPonty articulates a vision similar to Bour dieus when he states that the body is not a chunk of space or a bundle of functions but an intertwining of vision and movement19 Whereas the causal thinking that Descartes admired in geometry and sought to emulate in philosophy erases context by abstracting experience into generalized patterns embodiment creates context by forging connections between in stantiated action and environmental conditions Marking a tum from foundation to flux embodiment emphaSizes the importance of context to human cognition Here in another key and a reverse direction we see re played the decontextualization that information underwent when it lost its body Just as dis embodiment required that context be erased so remem bering embodiment means that context be put back into the picture When accounts oflearning change so do accounts of cultural transmis sion In How Societies Remember Paul Connerton links embodiment with memory He points out that rituals commemorative ceremonies and other bodily practices have a performative aspect that an analysis of the content does not grasp Like performative language performative rituals must be enacted to take place A liturgy for example is an ordering of speech acts which occurs when and only when these utterances are performed if 204  Chapter Eight there is no performance there is no ritual Although liturgies are primarily verbal they are not exclusively so Gestures and movements accompany the words in addition to the sense data created by speaking and hearing Over and above or better below the verbal aspects is the incorporation enacted through sensory responses motor control and proprioception Because these ceremonies are embodied practices to perform them is al ways in some sense to accept them whatever ones conscious beliefs We may suppose the beliefs someone else holds sacred to be merely fantastic Connerton wrote but it can never be a light matter to demand that their actual expression be violated  To make patriots insult their flag or to force pagans to receive baptism is to violate them20 Bodilypractices have this power because they sediment into habitual ac tions and movements sinking below conscious awareness Atthis level they achieve an inertia that can prove surprisingly resistant to conscious inten tions to modifY or change them By their nature habits do not occupy con scious thought they are habitual precisely because they are done more or less automatically as if the knowledge of how to perform the actions resided in ones fingers or physical mobility rather than in ones mind This property of the habitual has political implications When a new regime takes over it attacks old habits vigorously for this is where the most refrac tory resistance to change will be met Bourdieu comments that all societies wanting to make a new man should approach the task through processes ofdeculturation and reculturation focused on bodily practices Hence revolutionaries place great emphasis on the seemingly most insignificant details of dress bearing physical and verbal manners because they en trust to the body in abbreviated and practical ie mnemonic form the fundamental principles of the arbitrary content of the culture21 Bourdieu somewhat overstates the case when he asserts that principles embodied in this way are placed beyond the grasp of consciousness and hence cannot be touched by voluntary deliberate transformation p 94 but he is correct in emphasizing the resistance of such practices to intellec tion He also rightly sees the importance of these practices for education and discipline The whole trick of pedagOgic reason he observes lies preCisely in the way it extorts the essential while seeming to demand the in Significant in obtaining the respect for form and forms of respect which constitute the most visible and at the same time the besthidden because most natural manifestation of submission to the established order  The concession of politeness always contains political concessions pp 9495 Along similar lines Connerton wrote Every group will en trust to bodily automatisms the values and categories which they are most The Materiality of Informatics  anxious to conserve They will know how well the past can be kept in mind by a habitual memory sedimented in the body22 To summarize four distinguishing characteristics of knowledge gained through incorporating practices have emerged from the discussion so far First incorporated knowledge retains improvisational elements that make it contextual rather than abstract that keep it tied to the circumstances of its instantiation Second it is deeply sedimented into the body and is highly resistant to change Third incorporated knowledge is partly screened from conscious view because it is habitual Fourth because it is contextual re sistant to change and obscure to the cogitating mind it has the power to de fine the boundaries within which conscious thought takes place To these four characteristics I want to add a fifth When changes in incorporating practices take place they are often linked with new technologies that affect how people use their bodies and experience space and time Formed by technology at the same time that it creates technology embodiment medi ates between technology and discourse by creating new experiential frameworks that serve as boundary markers for the creation of correspond ing discursive systems In the feedback loop between technological inno vations and discursive practices incorporation is a crucial link Having distinguished between incorporating and inscribing practices I want to explore the connections between them To complete the model I have been constructing I tum now to Mark JohnsonS The Body in the Mind 23 It is a truism in contemporary theory that discourse writes the body Johnson illustrates how the body writes discourse He shows that the bodys orientation in time and space deriving from such common experi ences as walking upright and finding a vertical stance more conducive to mobility than a horizontal position creates a repository of experiences that are encoded into language through pervasive metaphoric networks Con sider for example metaphors having to do with verticality We speak of someone being upright in a moral or ethical sense of people at the top and of upscale lifestyles Depressing events are a downer in a recession people are down on their luck and entrylevel people start at the bot tom of the ladder The hierarchical structures expressed and constituted through these metaphors Johnson argues have a basis in bodily experi ence that reinforces and reinscribes their social and linguistic implications Other common body experiences giving rise to extensive metaphoric net works include inout frontback and containeduncontained Johnson characterizes such schema as prepropositional The point of his inquiry is to show that these encoded experiences bubble up into language in propo sitional statements such as He got high and in metapropositional state 206  Chapter Eight ments having to do with the truth or goodness of propositions such as That statement expresses a higher truth An obvious implication is that if we had bodies with significantly different physiological structures for example ex oskeletons rather than endoskeletons or unilateral rather than bilateral symmetries the schema underlying pervasive metaphoric networks would also be radically altered Of the theorists discussed here Johnson launches perhaps the most se vere attack on objectivism Thus it is ironic that he reinscribes objectivist presuppositions in positing a universal body unmarked by gender ethnic ity physical disability or culture Insisting that the body is an important part of the context from which language emerges he erases the specific contexts provided by embodiment The consequences of this erasure can be seen in his discussion of a passage from Men on Rape in which a law clerk tells why rape is in his view sometimes justified Johnson shows that the clerks reasoning is based on a series of interrelated propositions that begin with the idea that physical attraction is a physical force The clerk con structs a womans physical attractiveness as an aggression that she practices on men and to which they sometimes respond with allegedly retaliatory violence In some ways Johnsons analysis is remarkably astute for it reveals how gendered experiences of embodiment get encoded into implicit proposi tions Yet with stunning reticence he never remarks on the gender politics so obviously foregrounded by this series of propositions treating the exam ple as if it were sexually and culturally neutral More than one graduate stu dent whom I have asked to read Johnsons book has thrown it down in disgust at this point assuming that any analysis so genderblind could have nothing significant to say to her Although I sympathize with the reaction it is a mistake for the general point that embodiment is encoded into lan guage through metaphoric networks is strengthened rather than undercut by insisting on the specificities of phYSically diverse and differentially marked bodies Just as I can imagine that schema would vary for different physiologies so I can envision that metaphors would vary in response to dif ferent experiences of embodiment created by histOrically positioned and culturally constructed bodies From such considerations emerges an en riched appreciation of how inscribing and incorporating practices work to getherto create the heterogeneous spaces of postmodern technolOgies and cultures Although Johnson does not develop this implication his analysis sug gests that when people begin using their bodies in Significantly different ways either because of technological innovations or other cultural shifts The Materiality of Informatics  207 changing experiences of embodiment bubble up into language affecting the metaphoric networks at play within the culture At the same time dis cursive constructions affect how bodies move through space and time in fluence what technologies are developed and help to structure the interfaces between bodies and technologies By concentrating on a period when a new technology comes into being and is diffusing throughout the culture one should be able to triangulate between incorporation inscrip tion and technological materiality to arrive at a fuller description of these feedback loops than discursive analysis alone would yield To develop such an analysis I concentrate in the follOwing section on an information tech nology appropriate to the era under discussion specifically the use of mag netic taperecording from the early 1900s to 1962 the year Burroughs published The Ticket That Exploded Chapters 9 and 10 continue the analy sis into an array of contemporary virtual technolOgies Let us now return to an earlier period when it was a startling discovery to learn that ones voice could be taken out of the body and put into a machine where it could be manipulated to say something that the speaker had never heard before Audiotape and Its Cultural Niche In his groundbreakingwork Reading Voices Literature and the Phonotext Garrett Stewart asks not howwe read or why we read but where we read24 He decides we read in the body particularly in the vocal apparatus that pro duces subvocalization during silent reading This subvocalization is essen tial he argues to the production ofliterary language Language becomes literary for Stewart when it cannot be adequately replaced by other words when that particular language is essential to achieving its effects Literary language works by surrounding its utterances with a shimmer of virtual sounds homophoniC variants that suggest alternative readings to the words actually printed on the page Subvocalization actualizes these possibilities in the body and makes them available for interpretation Several interest ing consequences flow from this argument First the bodily enactment of suppressed sound plays a central role in the reading process Second read ing is akin to the interior monologue that we all engage in exceptthat it sup plies us with another story usually a more interesting one than that provided by the stream of subvocalized sound coming out of our own con sciousness Third the production of subvocalized sound may be as impor tant to subjectivity as it is to literary language 25 We are now in a position to think about what taperecording means for certain literary texts Audiotape opens the possibility that the voice can be taken out of the body and placed into a machine If the production of sub vocalized sound is essential to reading literary texts what happens to the stories we tell ourselves if this sound is no longer situated in the bodys sub vocalizations but is in the machine Often histories of technology and liter ature treat technology as a theme or subject to be represented within the world of the text I want to take a different approach focusing on the tech nical qualities of audiotape that changed the relation of voice and body a change Burroughs associates in Ticket with the production of a new kind of subjectivity In the mutating and metamorphosing bodies of Ticket we can see a harbinger of the posthuman body that will be fully articulated in the follOwing chapters These mutations are intimately bound up with internal monologues that in Burroughss view parasitically inhabit the body But I am getting ahead of my story First we need to trace the development of the audio technology that he uses to effect this startling view of discourse as a bodily infestation Born in the early 1900s and coming of age after World War II audiotape may already be reaching old age fading from the marketplace as it is re placed by compact disks computer hypermedia and the like The period when audiotape played an important role in US and European consumer culture may well be limited to the four decades of 195090 Writing his cybernetic trilogyThe Ticket That Exploded The Soft Machine and Nova Expressin the late 1950s and 1960s William Burroughs was close enough to the beginnings of audiotape to regard it as a technology of revo lutionary power Long after writing dissociated presence from inscription voice continued to imply a subject who was present in the moment and in the flesh Audiotape was of course not the first technology to challenge this assumption and the cultural work it did can best be understood in the con text of related audio technologies particularly telephone radio and phonograph Telephone and radio broke the link between presence and voice by mak ing it possible to transport voice over distance26 Before audiotape and phonograph however telephone and radio happened in the present Speaker and listener although phYSically separated had to share the same moment in time Telephone and radio thus continued to participate in the phenomenology of presence through the simultaneity that they produced and that produced them In this sense they were more like each other than either was like the phonograph By contrast the phonograph functioned primarily as a technology of inscription reproducing sound through a rigid disk that allowed neither the interactive spontaneity of telephone nor the ephemerality of radio The Materiality of Informatics  209 The niche that audiotape filled was configured through the interlocking qualities of the audio technologies that preceded it in a process Friedrich Kittler has aptly called medial ecology discussed briefly in chapter 227 Like the phonograph audiotape was a technology of inscription but with the crucial difference that it permitted erasure and rewriting As early as 1888 Oberlin Smith at one time president of the American Society of Me chanical Engineers proposed that sound could be recorded by magnetiz ing iron particles that adhered to a carrier 28 He was too busy to implement his idea however and the ball passed to Valdemar Poulsen a young Danish engineer who accidentally discovered that patterns traced on the side of a magnetized tuning fork became visible when the fork was dipped in iron powder When the fork was demagnetized the patterns were erased He saw in the imprinting and erasure of these patterns the possibility of a recording device for sound using iron wire as the carrier Its immediate commercial use he imagined would lie in providing tangible records of telephone conversations He called the device a Telegraphone which he understood to signify writing the voice at a distance At the 1900 Paris Ex position he won the Grand Prix for his invention29 Despite extensive pub licity however he was not able to raise the necessary capital in Europe for its development By 1903 the patents had passed to the American Tele graphone Company ATC which raised a huge amount of money 5000000 by selling stock Five years later the owners of ATC had still not built a single machine Their main business in fact turned out to be raising money for the machines rather than actually producing the ma chines When they did finally tum out a few operational devices in 1911 using the famous model Phoebe Snow to advertise them as dictation ma chines the sound quality was so bad that the Dupont Company after in stalling them in a central dictation system ended up suing The questionable status of the machines was exacerbated during World War I when the Telefunken Company of America was accused of using them to encode and transmit secret messages to Germany From the beginning au diotape was marked with the imprint of international capitalism and poli tics as surely as it was with the imprint of voices By 1932 steel tape had become the carrier of choice in highend ma chines and the British Broadcasting Corporation BBC became actively interested in the development of steel tape using it to carry the Christmas address of King George V in that year Film tape created by coating paper or plastic tape with iron oxide and feeding it through a ringshaped head appeared on the scene by 193530 The great advantage of film tape was that it could be easily spliced but originally it had such poor sound quality that 210  Chapter Eight it could not compete with steel tape The problem of establishing good cor respondence between sound frequency and the pattern on film tape that is controlling hysteresis was partly solved by the introduction of high frequency bias in 193831 By 1941 the sound quality of film tape had so improved that it was competitive with steel tape in studio work On the con sumer market machines with wire were still common It was not until after World War II that systematic research was carried out to find the optimum coating material for film tape and only in 1948 was the first American patent issued for a magnetic recording machine using film tape and a ring head The use of film tape then expanded rapidly and within a decade it had rendered steel tape obsolete with film tape being used in the consumer market as well as the professional studios By the late 1950s then magnetic tape had acquired the qualities that within the existing cultural formation gave it the force of paradox It was a mode of voice inscription at once permanent and mutable repeating past moments exactly yet also permitting present interventions that radically al tered its form and meaning These interventions could moreover be done at home by anyone who had the appropriate equipment Whereas the phonograph produced objects that could be consumed only in their manu factured form magnetic tape allowed the consumer to be a producer as well The switches activating the powerful and paradoxical technoconcep tual actors of repetition and mutation presence and absence were in the hands of the masses at least the masses who could afford the equipment The paradoxical qualities that magnetic tape was perceived to have in the late 1950s were forcefully expressed by Roy Walker involved in making taperecordings for the BBC during this period Anyone who has made a BBC recording and been in on the editing session may emerge feeling that he can no longer call himself his own Cuts and transpositions can be and are made Halves of sentences spoken at different times can be amalga mated to let a speaker hear himself say the opposite of what he knows he said Hearing oneself say something and continue with something else said half an hour earlier can be peculiarly disconcerting You might have the feeling that if you went quickly out of the studio you might catch yourself coming in32 His language locates the disconcerting effect both in the time delay sentences spoken at different times can be amalgamated and in the disjunction between voice and presence he can no longer call himself his own When these qualities of audiotape were enacted within literary productions a complex interplay was set up between representational codes and the specificities of the technology When voice was displaced onto tape the body metonymicallyparticipated in the transformations that The Materiality of Informatics  voice underwent in this medium For certain texts after 1950 the body be came a taperecorder When Burroughs wrote The Ticket That Exploded he took seriously the possibilities for the metonymic equation between taperecorder and body 33 He reasoned that if the body can become a taperecorder the voice can be understood not as a naturalized union of voice and presence but as a mechanical production with the frightening ability to appropriate the bodys vocal apparatus and use it for ends alien to the self The word is now a virus TTE p 49 the narrator says in a phrase indebted to the Buddhist inspired idea that ones sense of selfhood is maintained through an internal monologue which is nothing other than the story the self tells to assure it self that it exists34 Woven into this monologue are the fictions that society wants its members to believe the monologue enacts selfdiscipline as well as selfcreation Burroughs proposes to stop the interior monologue by making it external and mechanical recording it on tape and subjecting the recording to various manipulations Communication must become total and conscious before we can stop it the narrator asserts TTE p  51 Yet splicing tape is far from innocuous Once someones vocalizations and body sounds are spliced into someone elses the effects can feed back into the bodies setting off a riot of mutations The taperecorder acts both as a metaphor for these mutations and as the instrumentality that brings them about The taped body can separate at the vertical divide line grotesquely becoming half one person and half another as if it were tape splicedlengthvise In a disturbingly literal sense the taperecorder be comes a twoedged sword cutting through bodies as well as through the programs that control and discipline them In The Ticket That Exploded the body is a site for contestation and resistance on many levels as metaphor as physical reality as linguistic con struct and last but hardly least as taperecorder The taperecorder is cen tral to understanding Burroughss vision of how the politics of cooptation work Entwined into human flesh are prerecordings that function as parasites ready to take over the organism These prerecordings may be thought of as social conditioning for example an American upper middle class upbringing with maximum sexual frustration and humiliations imposed by MiddleWestern matriarchs TTE p 139 which not coinci dentally matches BurroughsS own experience A strong sense of sexual nausea pervades the text and sexuality is another manifestation of prere cording Parodically rewriting the fable in Platos Symposium about the spherical beings who were cut in half to make humans the narrator asserts All human sex is this unsanitary arrangement whereby two entities at  Chapter Eight tempt to occupy the same threedimensional coordinate points giving rise to the sordid latrine brawls  It will be readily understandable that a pro gram of systematic frustration was necessary in order to sell this crock of sewage as Immortality and Garden of Delights and love TTE p 52 The idea of two entities trying to occupy the same space is further rein forced by the vertical divide line crossing the body the phYSically marked line in bone muscle and skin where the neural canal of the monthold fe tus closes to create the beginnings of the torso35 The early point at which the divide line is imprinted on human flesh suggests how deeply impli cated into the organism are the prerecordings that socialize it into commu nity norms In one scene the narrator sees his body on the operating table split down the middle while a doctor with forceps was extracting crab parasites from his brain and spineand squeezing green fish paraSites from the separated flesh My God what a mess the doctor exclaims The difficulty is with two halvesother parasites will invade sooner or later  Sew him up nurse TTE p 85 As the doctorintimates the body is always already fallen Divided within itself rather than an organic unity it is subject to occupation and expropriation by a variety of parasitic forms both cultural and physical Chief among these parasitic forms is the word It is a truism in con temporary theory that discursive formations can have material effects in the physical world Without having read Foucault and Derrida Burroughs came to similar conclusions a decade earlier imagining the word as the bodys Other Half The narrator stated Word is an organism The pres ence of the Other Half a separate organism attached to your nervous sys tem on an air line of words can now be demonstrated experimentally The experiments to which the narrator alludes were performed by among oth ers John Cunningham Lilly who in the late 1950s and 1960s used isolation tanks to test the malleability of human perception36 The experiments re quired subjects to enter a dark tank and to float cut off from all sensory in put in water kept at body temperature The narrator mentions that a common hallucination of subjects in sense withdrawal was the feeling of another body sprawled through the subjects body at an angle TTE p 49 Yes quite an angle the narrator ironically remarks identifYing the sen sation as the subjects perception of his other half the word virus that invades the organism until it seems as intrinsic to the body as flesh and bone For the narrator the proof of this parasitic invasion and infection is the interior monologue we all experience Modem man has lost the option of silence he asserts Try to achieve even ten seconds of inner silence You The Materiality of Informatics  will encounter a resisting organism thatforces you to talk That organism is the word TTE pp 4950 Burroughss project is to offer the reader as many ways as he can imagine to stop the monologue to rewrite or erase the prerecordings and to extricate the subject from the parasitic invasion of the Other Half Taperecorders are central to this project its all done with tape recorders the narrator comments TTE p162 One strategy is to externalize dialogue by getting it out of your head and into the ma chines TTE p 163 He suggests thatthe reader record the last argument the reader had with a boyfriend or girlfriend putting the readers side of the argument on one recorder and the friends side on the other Then the two recorders can argue with each other leaving the human participants free to stop replaying the conversation in their heads and get on with their lives The narrator also suggests recording random sounds on a third machine snippets from a news broadcast sayand mixing them in too The intru sion of the random element is significant it aims to break the reader not only out of personal obsessions but also out of the surrounding culturally constructed envelope of sounds and words Wittgenstein said No propo sition can contain itself as an argument the narrator remarks interpret ing this as follows The only thing not prerecorded in a prerecorded universe is the prerecording itself which is to say any recording that con tains a random factor TTE p166 The intrusion of randomness is important in another way as well for Burroughs is acutely aware of the danger that he might through his words spread the viral infection he is trying to combat It is important therefore that disruptive techniques be instantiated within the texts own language These techniques range from his famous use of the cutup where he phYSically cuts up previously written narratives and arbitrarily splices them together to more subtle methods such as shifting between different lin guistic registers without transition or explanation37 Perhaps the single most important device is the insistent pressure to take metaphors literallyor put another way to erase the distinction between words and things Language is not merely like a virus it is a virus replicating through the host to become visible as green fish in the flesh and crab parasites tear ing at the base of the spine and brain In Burroughs the material effects of language do not need to be mediated through physical diSCipline to reform the body for example through the prescribed postures and gestures used to teach penmanship in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries With a writers license he makes language erupt directly into the body The body itself moreover is treated as if it phYSically were a recorder regulated by the principles that govern magnetic tape in its reproduction erasure and reconfiguration Here within the represented world of the text tech niques of inscription merge with incorporated practices in a cyborg config uration of explosive potential The double edge of this potential is not difficult to understand for the reifYing and infective power of words can be defused only through other words which can always tum against their mas ter and become infectious in tum Making the word flesh is both how the virus infects and how the vaccine disinfects In either case the flesh will not continue unchanged The pressure toward literalization can be seen in the narrative sections that use the conventions of science fiction to figure the invasion of the word as a physical operation early on the narrator announces I am reading a science fiction book called The Ticket That Exploded TTE p 5 On this track Earth has been invaded by the alien Nova mob socalled because their strategy is to drive the planet to extreme chaos or nova The mob in cludes such creatures as heavymetal addicts from Uranus sex addicts from Venus and other parasitic organisms that can occupy human flesh Nova criminals are not threedimensional organismsthough they are quite definite organisms as we shall seebut they need threedimen sional human agents to operate TTE p 57 A single parasitic alien can take over hundreds of humans stringing together its hosts to form rows of coordinate points analogous to lines of print or to phonemes subordi nated through grammar and syntax The reputed leader of the mob is an ap propriately bimorphic creature called variously Mr Bradly Mr Martin Mr and Mrs D or simply the Ugly spirit In this instantiation of the Other Half the word itself is split down the middle A counterinvasion has been staged by the Nova police whose weapons include radio static camera guns that destabilize images by vibrating them at supersonic speeds and of course taperecorders Recruiting Mr Lee this pseudonym used often by Burroughs was his mothers maiden name the district supervisor tells Mr Lee that he will receive his instruc tions from books street signs films in some cases from agents who pur port to be and may actually be members of the organization There is no certainty Those who need certainty are of no interest to this department This is in point of fact a nonorganization the aim of which is to immunize our agents against fear despair and death We intend to break the birth death cycle TTE p 10 One of the criminals the department seeks is Johnny Yen whose name suggests sexual desire Death is orgasm is rebirth is death in orgasm is their unsanitary Venusian gimmick is the whole birth death cycle of action the narrator explains He proceeds apparentlyexas perated to make his point even more obvious You got itNow do you The Materiality of Informatics I understand who Johnny Yen isThe BoyGirl Other Half strip tease God of sexual frustrationErrand boy from the death trauma TTE p 53 On this track the action can be read as a physical contest between the Nova mob and the Nova police as when a police operative from Minraud blows a mob crab guard into smithereens But if the word is a parasite with material effects the distinction between metaphor and actuality represen tation and reality is moot Thus another strategy of resistance is the Rewrite Room the space from which comes the expose of Johnny Yen cited above Johnny Yen is not blown away but rather is rewritten to become a rather enchanting green fish boy an amphibious lifeform a benign bi morphic creature living in the canals and mating with Ali the street boy in a nonhuman life cycle that destabilizes the human sense of what constitutes the body life and death The crisis of mutation the recognition that pat tern is always already penetrated by randomness is here associated with a form of embodiment that moves through a froth of noise as easily as a fish through water For human subjects however this destabilization is bound to be threat ening rather than simply liberating for the narrative attempts to put into play all the boundaries that define human subjectivity Body boundaries are often literally diSintegrated for example by the Sex Skin an organism that surrounds its victims with a second skin that gives its victims intense sexual pleasure while dissolving and ingesting them Positioned against the clear threat of this kind of sexual delirium are taperecorders potentially liberat ing but also not without danger Recording ones body sounds and splicing them into someone elses can free one from the illusion that body sounds cannot exist apart from the interior monologue But just as Burroughss words can become parasitic if not selfdisrupted so these sounds have the potential to constitute a parasitic monologue in tum According to the nar rator the splicing produces a strong erotic reaction If it is expressed in ac tual sexual contact it acts as an aphrodisiac  nothing more  Butwhen a susceptible subject is spliced in with someone who is not there then it acts as a destructive virus ironically becoming the phenomenon it was meant to counteract TTE p 20 As well as disrupting words audibly present Burroughs wants to create or exposenew ones from the substrata of the medium itself He de scribes experiments based on inching tape manually rubbing the tape back and forth across the head at varying speeds Such exercises bring you a liberation from old association locks  you will hear words that were not in the original recording new words made by the machine different people will scan out different words of course but some of the words are quite clearly there The technique gives new meaning to Marshall McLuhans aphorism The medium is the message for it is as if the words themselves had been interrogated and forced to reveal their hidden meanings it is in teresting to record these words literally made by the machine itself TTE p 206 Here Burroughs envisions incorporating practices that can pro duce inscriptions without the mediation of consciousness He actually performed the taperecorder experiments he describes from the late 1950s through the late 1970s He inched tape to create as he heard it new words he recorded radio broadcasts and spliced the tape to achieve an aural cutup and he held the microphone to the base of his throat and tried to record his own subvocal speech As if anticipating Chris tian fundamentalists who hear Satanic messages hidden in records and tapes people whose sensibilities he would no doubt enjoy outraging he also read from his books including The Nova Express and The Ticket That Exploded and spliced the readings in with music played backward The recordings have been preserved and some of this archival material has been collected in a phonograph album entitled Nothing Here Now but the Recordings38 Late one night I traveled to the music library at the U ni versity of California at San Diego to listen to the album Even though the experience of sitting in the nearly deserted hightech facility insulated from exterior sound was eerily conducive to hearing the words that Burroughs claims are there some of the passages are clearly of historic in terest only In particular the section that records subvocal speech is virtu ally unintelligible as patterned sound Perhaps paradOxically I found the recording less forceful as a demonstration of Burroughss theories than his writing For me the aurality of his prose elicits a greater response than the machine productions it describes and instantiates The power of that writing is evident in the writing machine section of The Ticket That Exploded The narrator describes an Exhibition which includes a room with metal walls magnetic mobiles under flickering blue light and smell of ozone TTE p 62 The room is situated of course in side a taperecorder Normally narrative fiction leaps over the technolo gies printing press paper ink that produce it and represents the external world as if this act of representation did not require a material basis for its production Burroughs turns this convention inside out locating the ex ternal world inside the technolOgical artifact The move constructs a com pletely different relation between fiction and the material means of its production constituting the technology as the ground out of which the nar rative action evolves This technique hints that the technology is not merely a medium to represent thoughts that already exist but is itself capable of dy The Materiality of Informatics  namic interactions producing the thoughts it describes At issue then is the technology not only as a theme but as an articulation capable of pro ducing new kinds of subjectivities The taperecording qualities important in the Exhibition are the twin and somewhat contradictory powers of inscription and mutation Unlike marks on paper this writing can eaSily be erased and rewritten in other forms As spectators clink through turnstiles of the Exhibition great sheets of magnetized print held color and disintegrated in cold mineral si lence as word dust falls from demagnetized patterns TTE p 62 The de scription points to the attraction the recorder has for Burroughs Sound unlike print dies away unless it is constantly renewed Its ephemerality calls forth a double response that finds material expression in the technol ogy On the one hand magnetic tape allows sound to be preserved over time in this respect it counters the ephemerality of sound by transforming it into inscription On the other hand inscriptions can be easily erased and reconfigured in this sense it reproduces the impermanence of sound Burroughs was drawn to both aspects of the technology The inscription of sound in a durable medium suited his belief that the word is material whereas the malleability of sound meant that interventions were possible interventions that could radically change or eradicate the record At the Exhibition language is inscribed through word dust that falls from the walls as pervasively as smog particlles from the Los Angeles sky Anticipating videotape Burroughs imagines that picture dust also falls from the walls Photomontage fragments backed with iron stuck to pat terns and fell in swirls mixing with color dust to form new patterns shim mering falling magnetized demagnetized to the flicker of blue cylinders pulsing neon tubes and globes TTE pp 6263 When the Nova police counterinvade the planet falling

photographShift body halves TTE p 105 The Grey Room evidently refers to the mobs com munication and control center perhaps the board room where the nar rator tells us multinationals plot to take over outer and inner space In opposition to the linear centralized control of the Grey Room is the chaotic recursivity of the Exhibition Here there is no clear line between those who act and those who are acted upon The traffic flow through the 218  Chapter Eight room is structured like a recursive loop As the spectators pass they are recorded by a battery of taperecorders recording and playing back mov ing on conveyor belts and tracks and cable cars spilling the talk and metal music fountains and speech as the recorders moved from one exhibit to an other The narrator remarks parenthetically Since the recorders and movies of the exhibition are in constant operation it will be readily seen that any spectator appears on the screen sooner or later if not today then yester day or tomorrow TTE p 64 Thus spectators move along within the room hearing and watching recordings of themselves as the recordings are played back from machines that are also moving along a conveyor belt Their reactions as they hear and watch are also recorded in turn by other machines creating an infinite regress in which body and tape recording and voice image and Sight endlessly reproduce each other Within this world it makes a weird kind of sense for bodies to mutate as easily as spliced tape for the distinction between reality and representation has been largely deconstructed Characters walk in and out of screen flickering dif ferent films on and off TTE p 64 bodies split in halflengthwise screens show two films simultaneously half of one on one side half of the other on the other side a writing machine shifts one half one text and half the other through a page frame on conveyor belts TTE p 65 Inscriptions bodies sounds and images all follow the same dynamics and the same logic of splices running lengthwise to create mutated posthuman forms that both express and strive to escape from the conditioning that makes them into split beings In a wonderfully oxymoronic phrase Burroughs calls the place where culture produces its replicating sound and image tracks the reality studio Clearly no portentous exciting events are about to transpire the narrator says implicitly mocking the melodrama of his own spacealien track You will readily understand why people will go to any lengths to getin the film to cover themselves with any old film scrap  anything to avoid the hopeless deadend horror of being just who and where you all are dying animals on a doomed planet Connecting capitalist finanCing with cultural produc tions as if remembering the American Telegraphone Company he con tinues The film stock issued now isnt worth the celluloid its sic printed on There is nothing to back it up The film bank is empty To conceal the bankruptcy of the reality studio it is essential that no one should be in posi tion to set up another reality set  Work for the reality studio or else Or else you will find out how it feels to be outside the film TTE p 151 As the text draws to a close the narrator directs the readers attention to the possibility that the reality studio may indeed be closing down and that The Materiality of Informatics  the reader will therefore shortly be outside the film off the recording A similar message is given in a different medium when at the end of the penultimate section the print of the text is dislUpted by several lines of cur sive script English alternating with Arabic Each line lUns through a per mutation of To say good by silence with the lines gradually becoming more random and indecipherable as they proceed down the page TTE p 203 Perhaps Burroughs is trying to prepare the reader for the panic that sets in when the interior monologue is dislUpted and for the first time in ones life one hears silence instead of language For whatever reason he takes extraordinary care to achieve a feeling of closure unusual in his works from this period Compared with Naked Lunch the ending here is formally elaborate and thematically conclusive Echoing The Tempest the text as it winds down splices in dialogue from Shakespeares play with visions of contemporary technologies i foretold you were all spirits watching TV programTerminal electric voices end These our actors cut inA few seconds later you are melted into airRub out promised by our everliving poetMr Bradly Mr Martin five times our summonsno shelter in setting forth TTE p 174 The splices invite the reader to tease out resonances between the two works Whereas insect imagery predominates in Naked Lunch in Ticket the usual form of nonhu man life is aquatic or amphibian recalling Calibans characterization as a fishy monster Prospero conjures spirits from the air and yet his magic has a terrible materiality he can we are told raise bodies from the dead Most of all he is a supreme technician blending illusion with reality so skill fully that his art can effect changes in the real world Burroughs aims for nothing less using language to dislUpt the viral power of the word creating recordings to stop the playbacks that imprison our future in the sounds of our past If the taperecorder is as Paul Bowles called it Gods little toy The Ticket That Exploded is the tape that reveals this godmachines life transforming possibilities Bowles quoted in TTE p166 What we see is dictated by what we hear the narrator of Ticket asserts TTE p 168 There is considerable anecdotal evidence to support his claim Whereas Sight is always focused sharp and delineated sound en velopes the body as if it were an atmosphere to be experienced rather than an object to be dissected Perhaps that is why researchers in virtual reality have found that sound is much more effective than sight in imparting emo tional tonalities to their simulated worlds 39 Their experiences suggest that voice is associated with presence not only because it comes from within the body but also because it conveys new information about the subject information that goes deeper than analytical thought or conscious inten tion Manipulating sound through taperecorders thus becomes a way of producing a new kind of subjectivity that strikes at the deepest levels of awareness If we were to trace the trajectory suggested here to the end of the period when audiotape held sway it would lead to texts such as C J Cherryhs Cyteen trilogy where the body has become a corporate product molded by taking tape that is listening to conditioning tapes that lay the foundation for the subjects psychset Burroughs anticipates Cherryhs implication that the voice issuing from the taperecorder sounds finally not so much postmodern as it does posthuman Where hope exists in Ticket it appears as posthuman mutations like the fish boy whose fluidity perhaps figures a type of subjectivity attuned to the froth of noise rather than the stability of a false self living an embodied life beyond human consciousness as we know it Butthis is mere conjecture for any representation of the internal life of the fish boy could be done only in words which would infect and destroy exactly the transformation they were attempting to describe For Burroughs the emphasis remains on sub version and disruption rather than creative rearticulation Even subversion risks being coopted and taken over by the viral word it can succeed only by continuing to disrupt everything including its own prior writing In this chapter I have been concerned with Burroughss fictions not only as harbingers of the posthuman but more immediately as sites where bodyembodiment and inscriptionlincorporation are in constant and dynamiC interplay with one another As we have seen in the Exhibition inscriptions fall from the walls to become corporeal word dust incorpo rations are transformed into inscriptions through video and audiorecord ing devices bodies understood as normative and essentialized entities are rewritten to become particularized experiences of embodiment and em bodied experience is transformed through the inscriptions of the tape recording back into essentialized manifestations of the word The recursivities that entangle inscription with incorporation the body with embodiment invite us to see these polarities not as static concepts but as mutating surfaces that transform into one another much like the Mobius strip that Grosz imagines for her volatile bodies Starting from a model emphasizing polarities then we have moved toward a vision ofinteractions both pleasurable and dangerous creatively dynamiC and explOSively trans formative It is no accident that recursive loops and reflexive strategies figure im portantly in these transformations for Burroughs shared with Humberto Maturana and Philip K Dick an appreciation for how potently reflexivity can destabilize objectivist assumptions Whereas Maturana located reflex The Materiality of Informatics  ivity in biolOgical processes and Dick placed it in psycholOgical dynamics Burroughs located it in a cybernetic fusion of language and technology Mutating into and out of the taperecorder the viral word reconfigures the taperecorder as a cybernetic technology capable of radically transforming bodies and subjectivities As for the external world where clear divisions separate observer from system human from technological artifact Matu rana Dick and Burroughs agreed although for different reasons that there is no there there Whatever the limitations of their works they shared a realization that the observer cannot stand apart from the systems being observed In exploring how to integrate observer and world into a unified field of interaction they also realized that liberal humanism could not con tinue to hold sway Just as the tide of posthumanism that Norbert Wiener had struggled to contain could not be held back neither could the techno lOgical advances in informatics advances that would soon displace second wave issues with thirdwave concerns  Choprer  NIn  e NARRATIVES OF ARTIFICIAL LIFE In contrast to the circular processes of Humberto Maturanas autopoiesis the figure most apt to describe the third wave is a spiral Whereas the sec ond wave is characterized by an attempt to include the observer in an ac count of the systems functioning in the third wave the emphasis falls on getting the system to evolve in new directions Selforganization is no longer enough The third wave wants to impart an upward tension to the re cursive loops of selforganizing processes so that like a spring compressed and suddenly released the processes break out of the pattern of circular selforganization and leap outward into the new Just as Heinz von Foerster served as a transition figure between the first and second waves so Francisco Varela bridges the transition between the second and third waves We saw in chapter 6 that Maturana and Varela ex tended the definition of the living to include artificial systems After coau thoring The Embodied Mind 1 Varela began to work in a new field known as Artificial Life and coedited the papers from the first European conference in that field In the introduction to the conference volume Toward a Prac tice of Autonomous Systems he and his coauthor Paul Bourgine layout their view of what the field of Artificial Life should be They locate its ori gins in cybernetics referencing William Grey Walters electronic tortoise and Ross AshbyS homeostat Although some characteristics of autopoiesis are reinscribed on the successor field of Artificial Life especially the idea that systems are operationally closed other features are new The change is signaled in Varelas subtle reconception of autonomy He and his coauthor wrote Autonomy in this context refers to the livings basic and funda mental capacity to be to assert their existence and bring forth a world that is Significant and pertinent without being predigested in advance Thus the autonomy of the living is understood here both in regards to its actions Narratives of Artificial Life  and to the way it shapes a world into significance This conceptual explo ration goes hand in hand with the design and construction of autonomous agents and suggests an enormous range of applications at all scales from cells to societies2 For Maturana shaping a world into significance meant that perception was linked primarily to internal processes rather than external stimuli3 We have seen the difficulties he had with evolution because he sought to put the emphasis instead on the organisms holistic nature and autopoietic circularity When Varela and his coauthor speak of shaping a world into significance the important point for them is that the systems organization far from remaining unchanged can transform it self through emergent behavior The change is not so much an absolute break however as a shift in emphasis and a corresponding transformation in the kind of questions the research programs pose as well as new strate gies for answering them Thus the relation of the third wave to the second is again one of seriation an overlapping pattern of replication and innovation The shift in questions and methodologies is not of course neutral For researchers who come to the field from backgrounds in cognitive science and computer science rather than from autopoiesis as Varela does the underlying assumptions all too eaSily lend themselves to reinscribing a dis embodied view of information But as Varelas presence in the field indi cates not everyone who works in the field agrees that disembodied organisms are the best way to construct Artificial Life Just as there were competing camps in the Macy Conferencesone arguing for a disembod ied view of information and one for acontextualized embodied viewso in Artificial Life some researchers concentrate on simulations insisting that embodiment is not necessary whereas others argue that only embodied forms can fully capture the richness of an organisms interactions with the environment Our old friend the observer who was at the center of the epistemological revolution sparked by Maturana in the third wave retreats to the periphery with a consequent loss of the sophistication that Maturana brought to epistemological questions The observer has however not alto gether vanished from the scene remaining in the picture as narrator and narratee of stories about Artificial Life To see how the observers presence helps to construct the field let us tum now to consider the strange flora and fauna of the world of Artificial Life The Nature and Artifice of Artificial Life At the Fourth Conference on Artificial Life in the summer of 1994 evolu tionary biolOgist Thomas S Ray put forth two proposals4 The first was a plan to preserve biodiversity in Costa Rican rain forests the second was a suggestion that Tierra his software program creating Artificial Lifeforms inside a computer be released on the Internet so that it could breed di verse species on computers allover the world Ray saw the two proposals as complementary The first aimed to extend biological diversity for protein based lifeforms the second sought the same for siliconbased lifeforms Their juxtaposition dramatically illustrates the reconstruction of nature go ing on in the field of Artificial Life affectionately known by its practitioners as AL The object of an AL instantiation Ray wrote recently is to intro duce the natural form and process of life into an artificial medium5 The lines startle In Rays rhetoric the computer codes composing these crea tures become natural forms of life only the medium is artificial How is it possible in the late twentieth century to believe or at least claim to believe that computer codes are aliveand not only alive but nat ural The question is difficult to answer directly for it involves assumptions that are not explicitly articulated Moreover these presuppositions do not stand by themselves but move in dynamic interplay with other formula tions and ideas circulating throughout the culture In view of this complex ity the subject is perhaps best approached through indirection by looking not only at the scientific content of the programs but also at the stories told about and through them These stories I will argue constitute a multilay ered system of metaphOriC and material relays through which life na ture and the human are being redefined The first level of narrative with which I will be concerned is the Tierra program and various representations of it written by Ray and others In these representations authorial intention anthropomorphic interpreta tion and the operations of the program are so interwoven that it is impos sible to separate them As a result the program operates as much within the imagination as it does within the computer The second level of narrative focuses on the arguments and rhetorical strategies that AL practitioners use as they seek to position Artificial Life as a valid area of research within theoretical biology This involves telling a story about the state of the field and the contributions that AL can make As we shall see the secondlevel story quickly moves beyond purely profeSSional considerations evoking a larger narrative about the kinds oflife that have emerged and are emerg ing on Earth The narrative about the present and future of terrestrial evo lution forms the third level It is constituted through speculations on the relation of human beings to their silicon cousins the creatures who live inside the computer Here at the third level the implication of the ob server in the construction of all three narratives becomes explicit To in Narratives of Arrificial Life I terrogate how this complex narrative field is initiated developed and in terpolated with other cultural narratives let us begin at the first level with an explanation of the Tierra program Conventionally Artificial Life is divided into three research fronts Wetware is the attempt to create artificial biolOgical life through such tech niques as building components of unicellular organisms in test tubes Hardware is the construction of robots and other embodied lifeforms Software is the creation of computer programs instantiating emergent or evolutionary processes Although each of these areas has its distinctive em phases and research agendas they all share the sense of building life from the bottom up In the software branch with which I am concerned here the idea is to begin with a few simple local rules and then through struc tures that are highly recursive allow complexity to emerge spontaneously Emergence implies that properties or programs appear on their own often developing in ways not anticipated by the person who created the simula tion Structures that lead to emergence typically involve complex feedback loops in which the outputs of a system are repeatedly fed back in as input As the recursive looping continues small deviations can quickly become magnified leading to the complex interactions and unpredictable evolu tions associated with emergence 6 Even granting emergence it is still a long jump from programs that repli cate inside a computer to living organisms This gap is bridged largely through narratives that map the programs into evolutionary scenarios tra ditionally associated with the behavior ofliving creatures The narratives translate the operations of computer codes into biolOgical analogues that make sense of the program logiC In the process the narratives alter the bi nary operations that on a physical level amount to changing electronic po larities transforming the binary operations into the high drama of a Darwinian struggle for survival and reproduction To see this transforma tion in action consider the follOwing account of the Tierra program This account is compiled from Thomas Rays published articles and unpub lished working papers from conversations I had with him about his pro gram and from public lectures he has given on the topic7 When I visited Ray at the Santa Fe Institute he talked about the genesis of Tierra Frustrated with the slow pace of natural evolution he wondered if it would be possible to speed things up by creating evolvable artificial or ganisms within the computer One of the first challenges he faced was de signing programs robust enough to withstand mutation without crashing To induce robustness he conceived of bUilding inside the regular com puter a virtual computer made out of software Whereas the regular com 226  Chapter Nine puter uses memory addresses to find data and execute instructions the vir tual computer uses a technique Ray calls address by template Taking its cue from the topological matching of DNA bases in which one base finds its appropriate partner by diffusing through the medium until it locates an other base with a surface it can fit into like a key into a lock address by tem plate matches one code segment to another by looking for its binary inverse For example if an instruction is written in binary code 1001 the virtual computer searches nearby memory to find a matching segment with the code 0110 The strategy has the advantage of creating a container that holds the organisms and renders them incapable of replicating outside the virtual computer for the address by template operation can occur only within a virtual computer Presented with a string such as 0110 the regular computer would read it as data rather than instructions to replicate Species diversifY and evolve through mutation To introduce mutation Ray created the equivalent of cosmic rays by having the program flip the polarity of a bit once in every 10000 executed instructions In addition replication errors occur about once in every 1000 to 2500 instructions copied introducing another source of mutation Other differences spring from an effect Ray calls sloppy reproduction analogous to the genetic mixing that occurs when a bacterium absorbs fragments of a dead organism nearby To control the number of organisms Ray introduced a program that he calls the reaper The reaper monitors the population and elimi nates the oldest creatures and those who are defective that is those who have most frequently erred in executing their programs If a creature finds a way to replicate more efficiently it is rewarded by being moved down in the reapers queue and so becomes younger The virtual computer starts the evolutionary process by allocating a block of memory that Ray calls the soup an analogy with the primeval soup at the beginning oflife on Earth Unleashed inside the soup are self replicating programs normally starting with a Single 80byte creature called the ancestor The ancestor comprises three segments The first segment counts the instructions to see how long the ancestor is this proce dure ensures that the length can change without throwing off the repro ductive process the second segment reserves that much space in nearby memory putting a protective membrane around the space an analogy with the membranes that enclose living organisms and the third segment copies the ancestors code into the reserved space thus completing the re production and creating a daughter cell from the mother cell To see how mutation leads to new species consider that a bit flip occurs in the last line of the first segment changing 1100 to 1110 Normally the program Narratives of Artificial Life  would find the second segment by searching for its first line encoded 0011 N ow however the program searches until it finds a segment starting with 0001 Thus it goes not to its own second segment but to another string of code in nearby memory Many mutations are not viable and do not lead to reproduction Occasionally however the program finds a segment that starts with 0001 and that will allow it to reproduce Then a new species is created as this organism begins producing ofpring When Ray set his program running overnight he thought he would be lucky to get a 1 or 2byte variation from the 80byte ancestor Checking it the next morning he found that an entire ecology had evolved including one 22byte organism Among the mutants were parasites that had lost their own copying instructions but had developed the ability to invade a host and hijack its copying procedure One 45byte parasite had evolved into a benign relationship with the ancestor others were destructive crowding out the ancestor with their own offspring Later runs of the pro gram saw the development of hyperparasites which had evolved ways to compete for time as well as memory Computer time is doled out equally to each organism by a slicer that determines when the organism can execute its program Hyperparasites wait for parasites to invade them Then when the parasite attempts to reproduce using the hyperparasites copy proce dure the hyperparasite directs the program to its own third segment in stead of returning the program to the parasites ending segment Thus the hyperparasites code is copied on the parasites time In this way the hyper parasite greatly multiplies the time it has for reproduction for in effect it appropriates the parasites time for its own This then is the first level narrative about the program It appears with minor variations in Rays articles and lectures I t is also told in the Santa Fe Institute videotape Simple Rules  Complex Behavior in which Ray collaborated with a graphiC artist to create a visual representation of Tierra accompanied by his voiceover8 If we ask how this narrative is con stituted we can see that statements about the operation of the program and interpretations of its meaning are in continuous interplay with each other Consider the analogies implicit in such terms as mother cell daughter cell ancestor parasite and hyperparasite The terms do more than set up parallels with living systems they also reveal Rays intention in creat ing an appropriate environment in which the dynamiC emergence of evolu tionary processes could take off In this respect Rays rhetoric is quite different from that of Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene a work also deeply informed by anthropomorphic constructions Dawkinss rhetoric attributes to genes human agency and intention creating a narrative ofhu manlike struggle for lineage In his construction Dawkins overlays onto the genes the strategies emotions and outcomes that properly belong to the human domain Ray by contrast is working with artificial systems de signed by humans precisely so the creatures would be able to manifest these qualities This is the primary reason why explanation and interpreta tion are inextricably entwined in the first level narrative  Rays biomorphic namings and interpretations function not so much as an overlay as an expli cation of an intention that was there at the beginning Analogy is not inci dental or belated but is central to the programs artifactual design Important as analogy is it is not the whole story The narratives com pelling effect comes not only from analogical naming but also from images In rhetorical analysis of course image can mean either an actual picture or a verbal formulation capable of evoking a mental picture Whether an image is a visualization or visually evocative language it is a powerful mode of communication because it draws on the high density of information that images convey Visualization and visually evocative language collaborate in the videotape that the Santa Fe Institute made to publicize its work As the narrative about Tierra begins the camera flies over a scene representing the inside of a computer This stylized landscape is dominated by a block like structure representing the CPU Central Processing Unit and dotted with smaller upright rectangles representing other integrated circuits Then the camera zooms into the CPU where we see a grid upon which the creatures appear and begin to reproduce They are imaged as solid poly gons strung together to form three sections representing the three seg ments of code Let us linger at this scene and consider how it has been constructed The pastoral landscape upon which the creatures are visual ized instantiates a transformation characteristic of the new information technologies and the narratives that surround them A material object the computer has been translated into the functions it performs the programs it executes which in tum have been represented in visual codes familiar to the viewer the bodies of the creatures The path can be represented schematically as material base 7 functionality 7 representational code This kind of transformation is extremely widespread appearing in popular venues as well as in scientific applications It is used by William Gibson in Neuromancer for example when he represents the data arrays of a global informational network as solid polygons in a threedimensional space that his protagonist transformed into a point of view or pov can navigate as though flying through the atmosphere lO The schematic operates in re markably similar fashion in the video where we become a disembodied pov flying over the lifeworld of the creatures a world comfortingly famil Narrarives of Arrificial Life  iar in its threedimensional spaces and rules of operation Whereas the CPU landscape corresponds to the computers interior architecture how ever the lifeworld of the creatures does not The seamless transition be tween the two elides the difference between the material space that is inside the computer and the imagined space that in actuality consists of computer addresses and electronic polarities on the computer disk To explore how these images work to encode assumptions consider the bodies of the creatures which resemble stylized ants In the program the creatures have bodies only in a metaphoriC sense as Ray recognizes when he talks abouttheir bodies ofinformation itself an analogyD These bod ies of information are not as the expression might be taken to imply phe notypic expressions of informational codes Rather the creatures are their codes For them genotype and phenotype amount to the same thing the organism is the code and the code is the organism By representing them as phenotypes visually by giving them threedimensional bodies and verbally by calling them ancestors parasites and such Ray elides the difference between behavior properly restricted to an organism and exe cution of a code applicable to the informational domain In the process our assumptions about behavior in particular our thinking of it as indepen dent action undertaken by purposive agents are transported into the narrative Further encoding takes place in the plot Narrative tells a story and in trinsic to story is chronology intention and causality In Tierra the narra tive is constituted through the emerging story of the struggle of the creatures for survival and reproduction More than an analogy or an im age this is a drama that if presented in a different medium one would not hesitate to identify as an epic Like an epic it portrays life on a grand scale depicting the rise and fall of races some doomed and some triumphant and recording the strategies they invent as they play for the high stakes of establishing a lineage The epic nature of the narrative is even more explicit in Rays plans to develop a global ecology for Ti erra In his proposal to cre ate a digital biodiversity reserve the idea is to release the Tierra program on the Internet so that it can run in background on computers across the globe Each site will develop its own micro ecology Because background programs run when demands on the computer are at a minimum the pro grams will normally be executed late at night when most users are in bed Humans are active while the creatures are dormant the creatures evolve while we sleep Ray points out that someone monitoring activity in Tierra programs would therefore see it as a moving wave that follows dark fall around the world Linking the evolution of the creatures to the hu 230  Chapter Nine man world in a complementary diurnal rhythm the proposal edges toward a larger narrative level that interpolates their story into ours ours into theirs A similar interpolation occurs in the video The narrative appears to be following the script of Genesis from the lightning that flickering over the landscape represents the life force to the creatures who like their hu man counterparts follow the biblical imperative to be fruitful and multiply When a deathshead appears on the scene representing the reaper pro gram we understand that this pastoral existence will not last for long The idyll is punctured by competition between species strategies of subversion and cooptation and exploitation of one group by anotherin short all the trappings of rampant capitalism To measure how much this narrative ac complishes we should remem ber that what one actually sees as the output of the Tierra program is a spectrum of bar graphs tracking the numbers of programs of given byte lengths as a function of time The strategies emerge when human interpreters scrutinize the binary codes that constitute the creatures to find out how they have changed and determine how they work No one knows this better of course than Ray and other researchers in the field The video as they would no doubt want to remind us is merely an artists visualization and has no scientific standing It is moreover intended for a wide audience not all of whom are presumed to be scientists This fact in itself is interesting for the tape as a whole is an unabashed promotion of the Santa Fe Institute It speaks to the efforts that practitioners in the field are making to establish Artificial Life as a valid significant and exciting area of scientific research These efforts are not unrelated to the visual and verbal transformations discussed above To the extent that the creatures are biomorphized their representation reinforces the strong claim that the creatures are actually alive extending the implications of the claim Nor do the transformations appear only in the video although they are particu larly striking there As the discussion above demonstrates they are also in scribed in published articles and commentary In fact they are essential to the strong claim that the computer codes do not merely simulate life but are themselves alive At least some researchers at the Santa Fe Institute recognize the relation between the strong claim and the stories that re searchers tell about these organisms Asked about the strong claim one respondent insisted Its in the eye of the beholder Its not the system its the observer12 In the second wave of cybernetics accounting for the observer was of course a central concern What happens when the observer is taken into ac Narratives of Artificial Life  count in Artificial Life research To explore further the web of connections between the operations of the program descriptions ofits operation by ob servers and the contexts in which these descriptions are embedded we will follow the thread to the next narrative level where arguments circulate about the contributions that Artificial Life can make to scientific knowl edge Positioning the Field The Politics of Artificial Life Christopher Langton one of the most visible of the AL researchers ex plains the reasoning behind the strong claim The principle sic assump tion made in Artificial Life is that the logical form of an organism can be separated from its material basis of construction and that aliveness will be found to be a property of the former not of the latter131t would be easy to dismiss the claim on the basis that the reasoning behind it is tautological Langton defines life in such a way as to make su re the programs qualify and then because they qualify he claims they are alive But more is at work here than tautology Resonating through Langtons definition are assumptions that have marked Western philosophical and scientific inquiry at least since Plato Form can lOgically be separated from matter form is privileged over matter form defines life whereas the material basis merely instantiates life The definition is a site of reinscription as well as tautology This con vergence suggests that the context for our inquiry should be broadened be yond the logical form of the definition to the field of inquiry in which such arguments persuade precisely because they reinscribe This context includes attitudes held deeply by many researchers in sci entific communities about the relation between the complexity of observ able phenomena and the relatively simple rules they are seen to embody Traditionally the natural sciences especially physics have attempted to reduce apparent complexity to underlying simplicity The attempt to find the fundamental building blocks of the universe in quarks is one example of this endeavor the mapping of the human genome is another 14 The sci ences of complexity with their origins in nonlinear dynamiCS complicated this picture by demonstrating that for certain nonlinear dynamical systems the evolution of the system could not be predicted even in theory from the initial conditions just as Ray did not know what creatures would evolve from the ancestor Thus the sciences of complexity articulated a limit on what reductionism could accomplish In a significant sense however AL researchers have not relinquished reductionism In place of predictability which is traditionally the test of whether a theory works they emphasize 232  Chapter Nine emergence Instead of starting with a complex phenomenal world and rea soning back through chains ofinference to what the fundamental elements must be they start with the elements complicating the elements through appropriately nonlinear processes so that the complex phenomenal world appears on its own 15 What is the justification for calling the simulation and the phenomena that emerge from it a world It is precisely because they are generated from simple underlying rules and forms AL reinscribes then the main stream assumption that simple rules and forms give rise to phenomenal complexity The difference is that AL starts at the simple end where syn thesis can move forward spontaneously rather than at the complex end where analysis must work backward Langton in his explanation of what AL can contribute to theoretical biology makes this difference explicit Artificial Life is the study of manmade systems that exhibit behaviors characteristic of natural living systems It complements the traditional bio logical sciences concerned with the analysis of living organisms by at tempting to synthesize lifelike behaviors within computers and other artificial media By extending the empirical foundation upon which biology is based beyond the carbonchain life that has evolved on Earth Artificial Life can contribute to theoretical biology by locating lifeasweknowit within the larger picture oflifeasitcouldbe 16 The presuppositions informing such statements have been studied by Stefan Helmreich an anthropologist who spent several months at the Santa Fe Institute 17 Helmreich interviewed several of the major players in the U S AL community including Langton Ray John Holland and others Helmreich summarized his informants views about the worlds they cre ate For many of the people I interviewed a world or universe is a self consistent complete and closed system that is governed by low level laws that in tum support higher level phenomena which while dependent on these elementary laws cannot be simply derived from them18 Helmreich used comments from the interviews to paint a fascinating picture of the various ways in which simple laws are believed to underlie complex phenomena Several informants thought that the world was mathematical in essence Others held the view also extenSively articulated by Edward Fredkin that the world is fundamentally composed of information 19 From these points of view phenomenological experience is itself a kind of illusion covering an underlying reality of simple forms For these researchers a computer program that generates phenomenological com plexity out of simple forms is no more or less illusory than the real world The formmatter dichotomy is intimately related to this vision for real Narratives ol Artificial Life I ity at the fundamental level is seen as form rather than matter specifically as informational code whose essence lies in a binary choice rather than a material substrate Fredkin for example says that reality is a software pro gram run by a cosmic computer whose nature must forever remain un known to us because it lies outside the structure of reality whose programs it runs20 For Fredkin AL programs are alive in precisely the same sense as biolOgical lifebecause they are complex phenomena generated by un derlying binary code The assumption that form occupies a foundational position relative to matter is especially easy to make with information tech nologies since information is defined in theoretic terms as we have seen as a probability function and thus as a pattern or form rather than as a ma terially instantiated entity Information technologies seem to realize a dream impossible in the nat ural worldthe opportunity to look directly into the inner workings of re ality at its most elemental level The directness of the gaze does not derive from the absence of mediation On the contrary our ability to look into pro grams like Tierra is highly mediated by everything from computer graphiCS to the processing program that translates machine code into a highlevel computer language such as C Rather the gaze is privileged because the observer can peer directly into the elements of the world before the world cloaks itself with the appearance of complexity Moreover the ob server is presumed to be cut from the same doth as the world being in spected inasmuch as the observer is also constituted through binary processes similar to those seen inside the computer The essence of Tierra as an artificial world is no different from the essence of the observer or of the world that the observer occupies all are constituted through forms un derstood as informational patterns When form is triumphant Tierras creatures are in a disconcertingly literal sense just as much lifeforms as are any other organisms We are now in a position to understand the deep reasons why some prac titioners think of programs like Tierra not as models or simulations but as life itself As Langton and many others point out in the analytic approach reality is modeled by treating a complex phenomenon as if it was composed of smaller constituent parts These parts are broken down into still smaller parts until we find parts sufficiently Simplified that they can be treated mathematically Most scientists would be qUick to agree that the model is not the reality because they recognize that many complexities had to be tossed out by the wayside in order to lighten the wagon enough to get it over the rough places in the trail Their hope is that the model nevertheless cap tures enough of the relevant aspects of a system to tell them something sig 234  Chapter Nine nificant about how reality works In the synthetic approach by contrast the complexities emerge spontaneously as a result of the systems operation The system itself adds back in the baggage that had to be tossed out in the analytic approach Whether it is the same baggage remains of course to be seen In this sense Artificial Life poses an interesting challenge to the view of nineteenthcentury vitalists who saw in the analytic approach a reductionist methodology that could never adequately capture the com plexities of life If it is true that the analytical approach murders by dissec tion by the same reasoning the synthetic approach of AL may be able to procreate by emergence In addition to these philosophical considerations there are also more obviously political reasons to make a strong claim for the aliveness of Ar tificial Life As a new kid on the block AL must jockey for position with larger betterestablished research agendas A common reaction from other scientists is Well this is all very interesting but what good is it Even AL researchers joke that AL is a solution in search of a problem When applications are suggested they are often open to cogent objec tions As long as AL programs are considered to be simulations any results produced from them may be artifacts of the simulation rather than prop erties of natural systems So what if a certain result can be produced within the simulation The result is artifactual and therefore nonsignifying with respect to the natural world unless the same mechanisms can be shown to be at work in natural systems21 These difficulties disappear however if AL programs are themselves alive Then the point is not that they model natural systems but rather that they are in themselves also alive and therefore as worthy of study as evolutionary processes in naturally occur ring media This is the tack that Langton takes when he compares AL simulations to synthetic chemicals 22 In the early days he observes the study of chemistry was confined to naturally occurring elements and compounds Although some knowledge could be gained from these the results were limited by what lay ready at hand Once researchers learned to synthesize chemicals their knowledge took a quantum leap forward for then chemicals could be tailored to specific research problems Similarly theoretical biology has been limited to the cases that lie ready at hand namely the evolutionary pathways taken by carbonbased life Even though generalizing from a sin gle instance is notoriously difficult theoretical biology had no choice car bonbased life was it Now a powerful new instance has been added to the repertoire for AL simulations represent an alternative evolutionary path way followed by siliconbased lifeforms Narratives of Artificial Life  What theoretical biology looks for in this view are similarities that cut across the particularities of the media In Beyond Digital Naturalism Walter Fontana and his coauthors layout a research agenda ultimately motivated by a premise that there exists a logical deep structure of which carbon chemistrybased life is a manifestation The problem is to discover what it is and what the appropriate mathematical devices are to express it23 Such a research agenda presupposes that the essence oflife under stood as logical form is independent of the medium More is at stake in this agenda than expanding the frontiers of theoretical biology By positing AL as a second instance oflife researchers affect the definition of biological life as well for now it is the juxtaposition that determines what counts as fundamental not carbonbased forms by themselves This change hints at the farreaching implications of the narrative of Ar tificial Life as an alternate evolutionary pathway for life on Earth To ex plore these implications let us turn to the third level of narrative where we will consider stories about the relation of humans to our silicon cousins the Artificial Lifeforms that represent the road not takenuntil now Reconfiguring the Body of Information As research on Artificial Lifeforms continues and expands the construc tion of human life is affected as well Rodney Brooks of the Artificial Intel ligence Laboratory at MIT and the roboticist Hans Moravec noted in earlier chapters tell two different narratives of how the human will be re configured in the face of artificial bodies ofinformation Whereas Moravec privileges consciousness as the essence of human being and wants to pre serve it intact Brooks speculates that the more essential property of the hu man being is the ability to move around and interact robustly with the environment Instead of starting with the most advanced qualities ofhu man thought Brooks starts with locomotion and simple interactions and works from the bottom up Despite these different orientations both Brooks and Moravec see the future of human being inextricably bound up with Artificial Life Indeed in the future world they envision distinguish ing between natural and Artificial Life human and machine intelligence will be difficult or impossible In Mind Children The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence Moravec argues that the age of carbonbased life is drawing to a close 24 Humans are about to be replaced by intelligent machines as the dominant lifeform on the planet Drawing on the work of A C CairnsSmith Moravec suggests that such a revolution is not unprecedented25 Before protein replication developed a primitive form oflife existed in certain silicon crystals that had the ability to replicate But protein replication was so far superior that it soon left the replicating crystals in the dust Now silicon has caught up with us again in the form of computers and computerized robots Although the CairnsSmith hypothesis has been largely discredited in Moravecs text it serves the useful purpose of increasing the plausibility of his vision by pre senting the carbonsilicon struggle as a rematch of an earlier contest rather than as an entirely new event A different approach is advocated by other members of the AL commu nity among them Rodney Brooks Pattie Maes and Mark Tilden26 They point to the importance of having agents who can learn from interactions with a physical environment Simulations they believe are limited by the ar tificiality of their context Compared with the rich variety and creative sur prises of the natural world simulations are stick worlds populated by stick figures No one argues this case more persuasively than Brooks When I talked with him at his MIT laboratory he mentioned that he and Hans Moravec had been roommates in college a coincidence almost allegorical in its neatness Moravec for his senior project had built a robot that used a central representation of the world to navigate The robot would go a few feet feed in data from its sensors to the central representation map its new position and move a few more feet Using this process it would take several hours to cross a room If anyone came in during the meantime it would be thrown hopelessly off course Brooks a loyal roommate stayed up late one night to watch the robot as it carried out its agonizingly slow perambulation The thought occurred to Brooks that a cockroach could accomplish the same task in a fraction of the time and yet the cockroach could not pOSSibly have as much computing power aboard as the robot Deciding that there had to be a better way he began building robots according to a different philosophy In his robots Brooks uses what he calls subsumption architecture The idea is to have sensors and actuators connected directly to simple finite state machine modules with a minimum of communication between them Each system sees the world in a way that is entirely different from how the other systems see the world There is no central representation only a control system that kicks in to adjudicate when there is a conflict be tween the distributed modules Brooks points out that the robot does not need to have a coherent concept of the world instead it can learn what it needs directly through interaction with its environment The philosophy is summed up in his aphorism The world is its own best model27 Subsumption architecture is deSigned to facilitate and capitalize on emergent behavior The idea can be illustrated with Genghis a Sixlegged Narratives If Artificial Life  robot somewhat resembling an oversize cockroach which Brooks hopes to sell to NASA as a planetary explorer28 Genghiss gait is not programmed in advance Rather each of the six legs is programmed to stabilize itself in an environment that includes the other five Each time Genghis starts up it has to learn to walk anew For the first few seconds it will stumble around then as the legs begin to take account of what the others are doing a smooth gait emerges The robot is relatively cheap to build is more robust than the large planetary explorers that NASA currently uses and is under its own local control rather than being dependent on a central controller who may not be on site to see what is happening Fast cheap and out of control is another aphOrism that Brooks use to sum up the philosophy be hind the robots he builds Brookss program has been carried furthe r by Mark Tilden a Canadian roboticist who worked under Brooks and novv is at the University ofVater 100 In my conversation with him Tilden mentioned that he grew up on a farm in Canada and was struck by how chickens ran around after they their heads had been cut off performing as he likes to put it complicated navi gational tasks in threedimensional space vvithout any cortex at all He de cided that considerable computation had to be going on in the peripheral nervous system He used the insight to design insectlike robots that operate on nervous nets considerably simpler than the more complex neural nets composed of no more than twelve transistor circuits These robots use ana logue rather than digital computing to carry out their tasks Like Genghis they have an emergent gait They are remarkably robust are able to right themselves when turned over and can even learn a compensatory gait when one of their legs is bent or broken off 29 Narratives about the relation of these robots to humans emerge when Brooks and others speculate about the relevance of their work to human evolution Brooks acknowledges that the robots he builds have the equiv alent of insect intelligence But insect intelligence is he says nothing to sneer at Chronologically speaking by the time insects appeared on Earth evolution was already 95 percent of the way to creating human intelli gence30 The hard part he believes is evolving creatures who are mobile and who can interact robustly with their environment Once these quali ties are in place the rest comes relatively quickly including the sophisti cated cognitive abilities that humans possess How did humans evolve In his view they evolved through the same kind of mechanisms that he uses in his robots namely distributed systems that interact robustly with the environment and that consequently see the world in very different ways Consciousness is a relatively late development analogous to the control 238  Chapter Nine system that kicks in to adjudicate conHicts between the different distrib uted systems Consciousness is as Brooks likes to say a cheap tricK that is an emergent property that increases the functionality of the system but is not part of the systems essential architecture Consciousness does not need to be and in fact is not representational Like the robots control sys tem consciousness does not require an accurate picture of the world it needs only a reliable interface As evidence that human consciousness works this way Brooks adduces the fact that most adults are unaware that they go through life with a large blank spot in the middle of their visual field This reasoning leads to yet another aphOrism that circulates through the AL community Consciousness is an epiphenomenon The implication is that consciousness although it thinks it is the main show is in fact a late comer a phenomenon dependent on and arising from deeper and more es sential layers of perception and being The view is reminiscent of the comedian Emo Phillipss comment I used to think that the brain was the most wonderful organ in the body he says But then I thought whos telling me this It would be difficult to imagine a more contrarian position to the one that Hans Moravec espouses when he equates consciousness with human subjectivity In this respect Moravec aligns with Artificial Intelligence AI whereas Brooks and his colleagues align with Artificial Life AL31 Michael Dyer in his comparison of the two fields points out that whereas AI envisions cognition as the operation oflogic AL sees cognition as the op eration of nervous systems AI starts with humanlevel cognition AL with insect or animallevel cognition in AI cognition is constructed as ifinde pendent of perception whereas in AL it is integrated with sensorymotor experiences32 Brooks and his colleagues forcefully argue that AI has played itself out and that the successor paradigm is AL Brooks and Ray both believe that we will eventually be able usingAL techniques to evolve the equivalent ofhu man intelligence inside a computer For Brooks that project is already un der way with Cog a headandtorso robot with sophisticated visual and manipulative capability But AL researchers go about creating highlevel intelligence in ways dramatically different from those of AI researchers Consider the implications of this shift for the construction of the human The goal of AI was to build inside a machine an intelligence comparable to that of a human The human was the measure the machine was the attempt at instantiation in a different medium This assumption deeply informs the Turing test dating from the early days of the AI era which defined success Narratives of Artificial Life I human intelligence By contrast the goal of AL is to evolve intelligence within the machine through pathways found by the creatures them selves Rather than serving as the measure to judge success human intelli gence is itself reconfigured in the image of this evolutionary process Whereas AI dreamed of creating consciousness inside a machine AL sees human consciousness understood as an epiphenomenon perching on top of the machinelike functions that distributed systems carry out 33 In the AL paradigm the machine becomes the model for understanding the human Thus the human is transfigured into the posthuman To indicate the widespread reach of this refashioning of the human into the posthuman in the following section I want to sketch with broad strokes some of the research contributing to this project The sketch will necessar ily be incomplete Yet even this imperfect picture will be useful in indicat ing the scope of the posthuman So pervasive is this refashioning that it amounts to a newworldviewone still in process highly contested and of ten speculative yet with enough links between different sites to be edging toward a vision of what we might call the computational universe In the computational universe the essential function for both intelligent ma chines and humans is processing information Indeed the essential func tion of the universe as a whole is processing information In a way different from what Norbert Wiener imagined the computational universe realizes the cybernetic dream of creating a world in which humans and intelligent machines can both feel at home That equality derives from the view that not only our world but the great cosmos itselfis a vast computer and that we are the programs it runs The Computational Universe Let us start our tour of the computational universe at the most basic level the level that underlies all lifeforms indeed all matter and energy The units that compose this level are cellular automata From their simple on off functioning everything else is built up Cellular automata were first proposed by John von Neumann in his search to describe selfreproducing automata Influenced by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pittss work on the onoff functioning of the neural system von Neumann used the McCullochPitts neuron as a model for computers inventing Switching de vices that could perform the same kind oflogical functions that McCulloch had outlined for neurons Von Neumann also proposed that the neural sys tem could be treated as a Turing machine Biology thus provided him with 240  Chapter Nine clues to build computers and computers provided clues for theoretical bi ology To extend the analogy between biological organism and machine he imagined a giant automaton that could perform the essential biological function of selfreproduction34 As we saw in chapter 6 Maturana re ferred to this when he made the point that what von Neumann modeled were biologists descriptions of living processes rather than the processes themselves Stanislaw Vlam a Polish mathematician who worked with von Neumann at Los Alamos during World War II suggested to von Neumann that he could achieve the same result by abstracting the automaton into a grid of cells Thus von Neumann reduced the massive and resistant materiality of the selfreproducing automaton as he had originally envisioned it to undif ferentiated cells with bodies so transparent that they were constituted as squares marked off on graph paper and later as pixels on computer screens35 Each cellular automaton or CA functions as a simple finitestate ma chine with its state determined solely by its initial condition on or off by rules telling it how to operate and by the state of its neighbors at each mo ment For example the rule for one group of CAs might state On if two neighbors are on otherwise off Each cell checks on the state ofits neigh bors and updates its state in accordance with its rules at the same time that the neighboring cells also update their states In this way the grid of cells goes through one generation after another in a succession of states that on a computer can easily stretch to hundreds of thousands of generations Ex tremely complex patterns can build up emerging spontaneously from in teractions between the CAs Programmed into a computer and displayed on the screen CAs give the uncanny impression of being alive Some pat terns spread until they look like the deSigns of intricate Oriental rugs oth ers float across the screen like gliders and still others flourish only to die out within a few hundred generations Looking at the emergence of complex dynamical patterns from these simple components more than one re searcher has had the intuition that such a system can explain the growth and decay of patterns in the natural world Edward Fredkin took this inSight further seeing in cellular automata the foundational structure from which everything in the universe is built up How does this building up occur In the computational universe the question can be rephrased by asking how higherlevel computations can emerge spontaneously from the underlying structure of cellular automata Langton has done pioneering work analyzing the conditions under which cellular automata can support the fundamental operations of computation Narratives of Artificial Life  which he analyzes as requiring the transfer storage and modification ofin formation 36 His research indicates that computation is most likely to arise at the boundary between ordered structures and chaotic areas In an or dered area the cells are tightly tied together through rules that make them extremely interdependent it is precisely this interdependence that leads to order But the tightly ordered structure also means that the cells as an ag gregate will be unable to perform some of the essential tasks of higherlevel computation particularly the transfer and modification of information In a chaotic area by contrast the cells are relatively independent of one an other this independence is what makes them appear disordered Although this state lends itself to information transfer and modification here the storage of information is a problem because no pattern persists for long Only in boundary areas between chaos and order is there the necessary in novationlreplication tension that allows patterns to build up modify and travel over long distances without dying out These results are strikingly similar to those discovered by Stuart Kauff man in his work on the origins oflife Kauffman was McCullochs last pro tege in several interviews McCulloch said that he regarded Kauffman as his most important collaborator since Pitts37 Kauffman argues that natural selection alone is not enough to explain the relatively short timescale on which life arose38 Some other ordering principle is necessary which he locates in the ability of complex systems spontaneously to selforganize Calculating the conditions necessary for large molecules to organize spon taneously into the building blocks of life he found that life is most likely to arise at the edge of chaos This means that there is a striking correspon dence between the conditions under which life is likely to emerge and those under which computation is likely to emergea convergence re garded by many researchers as an unmistakable sign that computation and life are linked at a deep level In this view humans are programs that run on the cosmic computer When humans build intelligent computers to run AL programs they replicate in another medium the same processes that brought themselves into being An important reason why such connections can be made so eaSily be tween one level and another is that in the computational universe every thing is reducible at 801ne level to information Yet among proponents of the computational universe not everyone favors disembodiment just as they did not in the Macy Conferences when the idea of information was be ing formulated Consider for example the different approaches taken by Edward Fredkin and the new field of evolutionary psychology When Fred kin asserts that we can never know the nature of the cosmic computer on 242  Chapter Nine which we run as programs he puts the ultimate material embodiment out of our reach All we as human beings will ever see are the informational forms of pure binary code that he calls cellular automata By contrast the field of evolutionary psychology seeks to locate modular computer pro grams in embodied human beings whose physical makeup is the result of hundreds of thousands of years of evolutionary processes The agenda for this new field is set out by Jerome H Barkow Leda Cos mides and John Tooby in The Adapted Mind Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture Like Minksy they argue that the model or metaphor of computation provides the basis for a wholesale revision of what counts as human nature39 They aim to overcome cultural anthropol ogists and others objections to the idea of human nature by offering a more flexible version of how that nature is constituted They argue that be havior can be modeled as modular computer programs running in the brain The underlying structure of these programs is the result of thou sands of years of evolutionary tinkering Those adaptations that conferred superior reproductive fitness survived those that did not died out The pro grams are structured to enable certain functionalities to exist in humans and these functionalities are universally present in all humans These func tionalities however represent potentials rather than actualities Just as the actual behavior of a computer program is determined by a constant under lying structure and varying inputs so actual human behavior results from an interplay between the potential represented by the functionalities and the inputs provided by the environments All normal human infants for ex ample have the potential to learn language If they are not exposed to lan guage by a certain critical age however this potential disappears and they can never become linguistically competent Although human behavior varies across a wide spectrum of actualization it nevertheless has an un derlying universal structure determined by evolutionary adaptations Thus a science of evolutionary psychology is possible for the existence of a uni versal underlying structure guarantees the regularities that any science needs in order to formulate coherent and consistent knowledge This cyberneticcomputer vision of human behavior leads to a very dif ferent account of human nature Although the evolutionary programs that the braincomputer runs do not lead to universal behavior they are nevertheless rich with content The potentials lie not just in the structure of the general machine but much more specifically in the environmentally adaptive programs that proactively shape human responses Thus children are not merely capable oflearning language they actively want to learn lan guage and will invent it among themselves if no one teaches them40 Like Narratives of Artificial Life I Wieners cybernetic machine the cybernetic brain is responsive to the flow of events around it and is adaptive over an astonishingly diverse set of cir cumstances The fact that only the intelligent machine is seen to be light enough on its feet to do justice to human variability is a measure of just how much our vision of machines has changed since the Industrial Revolution It will now perhaps be clear why the most prized functionality is the abil ityto process information forin the computational universe information is king Luc Steels an AL researcher reinscribes this value when he distin guishes between firstorder emergence and secondorder emergence surely it is no accident that the terminology here echoes the distinction be tween first order cybernetics and secondorder cybernetics the grandpar ent and parent of Artificial Life Firstorder emergence denotes any properties that are generated by interactions between components that is properties that emerge as a result of those interactions in contrast to prop erties inherent in the components themselves Among all such emergent properties secondorder emergence grants speCial privilege to those that bestow additional functionality on the system particularly the ability to process information41 To create successfill Artificial Life programs it is not enough to create just any emergence Rather the programmer searches for a design that will lead to secondorder emergence Once secondorder emergence is achieved the organism has in effect evolved the capacity to evolve Then evolution can really take off Humans evolved through a combination of chance and selforganizing processes until they reached the point where they could take conscious advantage of the princi ples of selforganization to create evolutionary mechanisms They used this ability to build machines capable of selfevolution Unlike humans how ever the machine programs are not hampered by the time restrictions imposed by biolOgical evolution and physical maturation They can run through hundreds of generations in a day millions in a year Until very re cently humans have been without peer in their ability to store transmit and manipulate information Now they share that ability with intelligent machines To foresee the future of this evolutionary path we have only to ask which of these organisms competing in many ways for the same evolu tionary niche has the informationprocessing capability to evolve more qUickly This conclusion makes clear I think why the computational universe should not be accepted unCritically If the name of the game is processing information it is only a matter of time until intelligent machines replace us as our evolutionary heirs Whether we decide to fight them or join them by becoming computers ourselves the days of the human race are numbered 244  Chapter Nine The problem here does not lie in the choice between these options rather it lies in the framework constructed so as to make these options the only two available The computational universe becomes dangerous when it goes from being a useful heuristic to an ideology that privileges information over everything else As we have seen information is a socially constructed con cept in addition to its currently accepted definition it could have been and was given different definitions Just because information has lost its body does not mean that humans and the world have lost theirs Fortunately not all theorists agree that it makes sense to think about in formation as an entity apart from the medium that embodies it Let us re visit some of the sites in the computational universe this time to locate those places where the resistance of materiality does useful work within the theories From this perspective fracture lines appear that demystify the programs and make it possible to envision other futures futures in which human beings feel at home in the universe because they are embodied creatures living in an em bodied world Murmurs from the Body One of the striking differences between researchers who work with flesh and those who work with computers is how nuanced the sense of the bodys complexity is for those who are directly engaged with it The difference can be seen in the contrast between Marvin Minskys society of mind ap proach and the approach of the evolutionary psychologists Although Min sky frequently uses evolutionary arguments to clarifY the structure of a program his main interest clearly lies in bUilding computer models that can accomplish human behaviors 42 He characteristically thinks in terms of computer architecture about which he knows a great deal rather than hu man physiology In his lectures and less so in his writing he rivals Moravec in his consistent downplaying of the importance of embodiment At the public lecture he delivered in 1996 on the eve of the Fifth Conference on Artificial Life in Nara Japan he argued that only with the advent of com puter languages has a symbolic mode of description arisen adequate to ac count for human beings whom he defines as complicated machines A person is not a head and arms and legs he remarked Thats trivial A per son is a very large multiprocessor with a million times a million small parts and these are arranged as a thousand computers It is not surprising then that he shares with Moravec the dream of banishing death by downloading consciousness into a computer The most important thing about each per son is the data and the programs in the data that are in the brain And some Narratives of Artificial Life  day you will be able to take all that data and put it on a little disk and store it for a thousand years and then tum it on again and you will be alive in the fourth millennium or the fifth millennium4l Yet anyone who actually works with embodied forms from the relatively simple architecture of robots to the vastly more complicated workings of the human neural system knows that it is by no means trivial to deal with the resistant materialities of embodiment To Minsky these problems of embodiment are nuisances that do not even have the virtue of being con ceptually interesting In his plenary lecture at the Fifth Conference on Ar tificial Life he asserted that a student who constructed a simulation of robot motion learned more in six months than the roboticists did in six years of building actual robots44 Certainly simulations are useful for a wide range of problems for they abstract a few features out of a complex inter active whole and then manipulate those features to get a better under standing of what is going on Compared with the real world they are more efficient precisely because they are more Simplified The problem comes when this mode of operation is taken to be fully representative of a much more complex reality and when everything that is not in the simulation is declared to be trivial unimportant or uninteresting Like Varela in his criticisms and modifications of Minskys model dis cussed in chapter 6 Barkow Tooby and Cosmides are careful not to make this mistake They acknowledge that the mindbody duality is a social con struction that obscures the holistic nature of human experience Another researcher who speaks powerfully to the importance of embodiment is An tonio Damasio in Descartes Error Enwtion Reason and the Human Brain Discussing the complex mechanisms by which mind and body com municate he emphasizes that the body is more than a lifesupport system for the brain The body contributes a content that is part and parcel of the workings of the normal mind45 Drawing on his detailed knowledge of neurophysiology and his years of experience working with patients who have suffered neural damage he argues that feelings constitute a window through which the mind looks into the body Feelings are how the body communicates to the mind information about its structure and continu ously varying states If feelings and emotions are the body murmuring to the mind then feelings are just as cognitive as other precepts part of thought and indeed part of what makes us rational creatures p xv Damasio finds it significant that cognitive science with its computational approach to mind has largely ignored the fact that feelings even exist with some notable exceptions such as The Embodied Mind discussed in chap ter 6 One can guess what his response to the scenario of downloading hu man consciousness would be from the following passage In brief neural circuits represent the organism continuously as it is perturbed by stimuli from the physical and sociocultural environments and as it acts on those environments If the basic topic of those representations were not an or ganism anchored in the body we might have some form of mind but I doubt that it would be the mind we do have p 226 Human mind without human body is not human mind More to the point it doesnt exist What are we to make then of the posthuman As the liberal humanist subject is dismantled many parties are contesting to determine what will count as posthuman in its wake For most of the researchers discussed in this chapter becoming a posthuman means much more than having pros thetic devices grafted onto ones body It means envisioning humans as in formationprocessing machines with fundamental similarities to other kinds of informationprocessing machines especially intelligent comput ers Because of how information has been defined many people holding this view tend to put materiality on one side of a divide and information on the other side making it possible to think of information as a kind of imma terial fluid that circulates effortlessly around the globe while still retaining the solidity of a reified concept Yetthis is notthe only view and in my judg ment it is not the most compelling one Other voices insist that the body cannot be left behind that the specificities of embodiment matter that mind and body are finally the unity that Maturana insisted on rather than two separate entities Increasingly the question is not whether we will be come posthuman for posthumanity is already here Rather the question is what kind of posthumans we will be The narratives of Artificial Life reveal that if we acknowledge that the observer must be part of the picture bodies can never be made of information alone no matter which sine of the com puter screen they are on  Chaprer  Te  n THE SEMIOTICS OF VIRTUALITY MAPPING THE POSTHUMAN Over twenty years ago Ihab Hassan prescient as usual predicted the ar rival of the posthuman We need first to understand that the human formincluding human desire and all its external representationsmay be changing radically and thus must be revisioned  five hundred years of humanism may be coming to an end as humanism transforms itself into something we must helplessly call posthumanisml As we accelerate into the new millennium questions about the posthuman become increasingly urgent Nowhere are these questions explored more passionately than in contemporary speculative fiction This chapter returns to terms previously introduced to show how they can be used to map the posthuman as a liter ary phenomenon The truism that the map is not the territory is especially so in this instance for the posthuman although still a nascent concept is already so complex that it involves a range of cultural and technical sites including nanotechnology microbiology virtual reality artificial life neurophysiology artificial intelligence and cognitive science among others Nevertheless even a crude map may serve as a useful heuristic in understanding the axes along which the posthuman is unfolding and the deep issues the posthuman raises To construct the map I return to the idea that the two central dialectics involved in the formation of the posthuman are presence absence and pat ternlrandomness In chapter 2 I suggested that as information becomes more important the dialectic of patternrandomness with which infor mation has deep ties tends toward ascendancy over the dialectic of pres enceabsence It would be a mistake to think that the presenceabsence dialectic no longer has explanatory power however for it connects materi ality and signification in ways not possible within the patternrandomness dialectic To be useful the map of the posthuman needs to contain both di 248  Chapter Ten alectics Thus I pick up here the clue dropped at the end of chapter 2 that patternrandomness can profitably be seen as complementary to pres enceabsence rather than as antagonistic Conjoining the two dialectics in this chapter will also allow us to explore the full complexities of the theoret ical framework proposed in chapter 8 of embodimentbody and incorpo rationinscription Let us begin by considering the patternrandomness and presenceab sence dialectics as the two axes of a semiotic square The semiotic square appeals to me as a heuristic because ofits unusual combination of structure and flexibility 2 The structure is defined by the axes and the formal relation ships they express but the terms composing those axes are not static Rather they interact dynamically with their partners and out of these in teractions new synthetic terms can arise The dialectics can be set in motion by placing presence absence along the primary axis with patternrandom ness located along the secondary axis The relation of the secondary axis to the primary axis is one of exclusion rather than opposition see figure 2 Patternrandomness tells a part of the story that cannot be told through presenceabsence and vice versa The diagonal connecting presence and pattern can conveniently be labeled replication for it points to continua tion An entity that is present continues to be so a pattern repeating itself across time and space continues to replicate itself By contrast the axis con necting absence and randomness signals disruption Absence disrupts the illusion of presence revealing its lack of originary plenitude Randomness tears holes in pattern allowing the white noise of the background to pour through N ow we are ready to set the semiotic square in dynamiC motion Out of the interplay between and among terms on the primary and secondary axes more dialectics can be produced which in tum produce further dialectics Presence Absence disruption7_1   replication Randomness           Pattern FIGURE 2 The semiotics of virtuality The Semiotics of Virtuality I and so on indefinitely For my purposes here it will be sufficient to move through one of these transformations by adding a layer of synthesizing terms to the original square see figure 3 On the top horizontal the synthetic term that emerges from the inter play between presence and absence is materiality I mean the term to refer both to the signifYing power of materialities and to the materiality of signi fYing processes On the left vertical the interplay between presence and randomness gives rise to mutation Mutation testifies to the mark that ran domness leaves upon presence When a random event intervenes to affect an organisms genetic code for example this intervention changes the material form in which the organism will manifest itself in the world In chapter 2 mutation was associated with the displacement of presence absence by patternrandomness Here it appears as a synthesizing term between randomness and presence to indicate that when randomness erupts into the material world mutation achieves its potency as a social and cultural manifestation of the posthuman On the right vertical the in terplay between absence and pattern can be called following Jean Bau drillard hyperreality Predicting the imploSion of the social into the hyperreal Baudrillard has described the process as a collapse of the dis Materiality Mutation Hyperreality Information FIGURE 3 Transformation of the semiotic square 250  Chapter Ten tance between signifier and signified or between an original object and its simulacra The terminus for this train of thought is a simulation that does not merely compete with but actually displaces the original Anyone who has spent a lifetime seeing reproductions of the Mona Lisa and then stood before the original seeing it now not as the original but simply as one more term in a reproduction of images will understand intuitively the process that Baudrillard calls the precession of simulacra 3 Finally on the bottom horizontal the interplay between pattern and randomness I will label information intending the term to include both the technical mean ing of information and the more general perception that information is a code carried by physical markers but also extractable from them The schematic shows how concepts important to the posthumanmateriality information mutation and hyperrealitycan be understood as synthetic terms emerging from the dialectics between presenceabsence and pat ternrandomness To flesh out this schematic I will take as my tutor texts four novels cho sen to illustrate various articulations of the posthuman see figure 44 Each pair of texts can be represented through a pair of complementary ques tions Representing mutation is Greg Bears Blood Music a narrative in which the posthuman emerges by radically reconfiguring human bodies Paired with it along the horizontal axis is Cole Perrimans Terminal Games a murder mystery in which the murderer turns out to be a virtual con Body Boundaries Problematized Mutation Blood Music Modes of I nscription Problematized Materiality Galatea 22 Hyperreality  Terminal Games Information Snow Crash FIGURE 4 Tutor texts mapped onto the semiotic square The Semiotics of Virtuality I 25 sciousness who believes his simulated virtual world is more real than the material world inhabited by the humans Both are driven by anxiety about body boundaries a theme familiar to us from scientific works such as Norbert Wieners Cybernetics and Humberto Maturanas autopoiesis and from literary works such as Bernard Wolfes Limbo and Philip K Dicks Simulacra Blood Music asks What if humans were taken over by their component parts functioning now as conscious entities themselves Ter minal Games asks the complementary question What if humans were made to function as if they were components of another entity On the vertical axis illustrating the dynamiCS of materiality is Richard Powerss Galatea 22 an autobiographical novel in which the protagonist becomes involved in a project to create a neural net sophisticated enough to pass a masters examination in English literature Here the posthuman takes the form of a sympathetic artificial intelligence that finally becomes so complex and selfreferential that it might as well be called conscious The question this text asks is What if a computer behaved like a person The dynamiCS of information is explored through Neal Stephensons Snow Crash a novel based on the premise that a computer virus can also infect humans crashing their neocortical software and turning them into mecha nized entities who have no choice but to run the programs fed into them The complementary question this text poses is What if people were made to behave as if they were computers Whereas the question of body boundaries figures importantly along the horizontal axis here along the vertical axis the important questions are concerned with modes of inscrip tion and their ability to dominate or substitute for the flesh As the shape of a landscape emerges from the wireframe abstractions of the model it will become evident that there is no consensus on what the posthuman portends in part because how the posthuman is constructed and imagined varies so widely What the topology will reveal is not so much an answer to the deep question of how the human and the posthuman should be articulated together as the complexity of the contexts within which that question is being posed Let us turn now to a discussion of the in dividual texts where an array of different configurations of the posthuman will be articulated The posthuman appears in these texts not as an abstract entity obeying general rules but as a heterogeneous force field through which certain vectors run I have chosen not to weave the discussions into a seamless web lest I make the posthuman appear more unified than it is Rather the discussions are meant to perform like hypertext lexias inviting the reader to construct Significance out of ruptures juxtapositions and im plied links  Chapter Ten The Mutating Bodies of Blood Music Vergil Ulam is a brilliant but irresponsible researcher who has found a way to combine human cells with computer chips His name an amalgam of Dantes guide Vergil and the cocreator of the atom bomb Stanislaw Ulam hints at his dual function as guide and provocateur Panicked when his illicit research is discovered by his supervisors Vergil decides to swallow the biochips hoping in this way to smuggle them out of the lab and retrieve them later from his bloodstream But the cells have other ideas Inside his body they continue to evolve until each cell is as intelligent as a human As if fulfilling Wieners nightmare vision of communication paths between small internal units that bypass and sabotage the human subject the cells increasingly gain control over their macroscopic host Already highly orga nized they begin rearranging his body rebuilding his spinal column cor recting his vision changing his metabolism Within a few days they break through the bloodbrain barrier and realize that Vergil is not coextensive with the universe Then they begin leaking through his skin to colonize the world outside In a stunningly short time they reorganize almost all of the human population of North America converting the humans from au tonomous organisms into flowing brown sheets that drape gracefully over the landscape Human language has encoded within it along many vectors the presup position of a human actor with agency autonomy and discrete boundaries When the cells become speakers as well as actors Greg Bear tries to invent for them a language and a typography that encode their profoundly differ ent relations to each other and to their environment Other than Vergil they have two interlocutors One is Michael Bernard a highlevel consul tant for Vergils company Bernard flees to a highsecurity isolation ward at a European biological research company Although he is already infected the cells delay reorganizing him trapped inside the isolation room they would not be able to join with other cell colonies In North America the hu mancell dialogue is continued through Suzy McKenzie a retarded woman whom the cells have not converted Although she thinks it might be be cause they want to keep her as a specimen of a nearly vanished species like an animal in a zoo BM p 220 we find out it is because her retardation is associated with an unusual blood chemistry that the cells have not yet fig uredout For Suzy the dialogue takes the form of conversations she has with fam ily members who return to her after they have changed No longer hu man these posthumans are reconstructions that the cells have built with The Semiotics of Virtuality  great effort and that they can sustain for only a short time The reconstruc tions suggest that Suzy can choose whether she wants to change or not The dialogue thus becomes a vehicle through which the author can compare the relative advantages of human and posthuman states The reconstruc tions reassure Suzy about the change telling her that she has nothing to lose but her loneliness These posthumans insist they have not been de stroyed only mutated so that they now can have continuous and rich com munication with millions of other intelligent beings Slower than her fellow humans Suzy has felt isolated and alone most of her life Her situation ac centuated by the fact that there are almost no other humans left on North America comes to function as a metaphor for the human condition By comparison with the combined mental power of the cells humans are an inferior breed suffering from mental deficiency and a congenital inability to communicate with their fellows except in highly mediated and uncertain ways In this sense we are all Suzys clinging to our autonomy as if it were an addictive drug suffering acutely from loneliness but too stubborn and slow to accept the change that would transform us into the posthuman For Bernard as intelligent and quick as Suzyis slow and bewildered the dialogues take a different form As Vergil did Bernard hears the cells telepathically and senses them kinesthetically as a music in his blood Since there is no percentage in changing him the cells try to preserve his identity for as long as pOSSible You already are one of us they communicate to him We have encoded parts of you into many teams for processing We can encode your PERSONALITY and complete the loop Bernard con fesses Tm afraid you will steal my soul from inside They counter Your SOUL is already encoded BM p 174 The isolation room in which he is encapsulated serves as a visible metonymy for his existential condition as a human His case is exceptional because he is literally cut off from his fellow humans but it is typical in the sense that compared with the rich stream of continuous communication the cells experience all humans remain in rel ative isolation from one another Faced with a lifetime sentence of isolation versus life as a cell colony Bernardlike Suzydecides to go willingly into that dark night From his computer terminal which gradually be comes merged with his body as the cells reorganize his digits so that he can tap directly into the digital information flow he sends back reports to his oncefellow humans on what it feels like to become a posthuman There is no light but there is sound It fills him in great sluggish waves not heard but felt through his hundred cells The cells pulse separate contract according to the rush of fluid He is in his own blood He can taste the presence of the cells making up his new being and of cells not directly part of him He can 251 I Chapter Ten feel the rasping of microtubules propelling his cytoplasm What is most re markable he can feelindeed it is the ground of all sensationthe cyto plasm itself BM p 189 The scene recalls Maturanas insistence that humans are nothing other than their autopoietic processes But alien to Maturanas vision is the im perative to change that dominates this plot All along the cells have been warning Bernard that they can hold off from transforming him for only so long Their compulsive drive toward expansion and transformation recalls the capitalist imperative to keep the cycle of increasing consumption spin ning lest the economy collapse under its own weight The cells may not manifest possessive individualism but they act like good capitalists in com pulsively seeking new territories for their imperialistic expansion5 Despite the focus on changes in embodiment the scientists in the text proclaim that information is the essence of reality as if to confirm that the final reality here is the computational universe Gogarty a mathematician who visits Bernard while he is in isolation announces There is nothing Michael but information All particles all energy even space and time it self are ultimately nothing but information BM p 177 The hypothesis that Gogarty has come to share with Bernard is a weirdscience blend of the Uncertainty Principle and social constructivism Consciousness and the universe collaborate in determining the laws of nature Until now the den sity of consciousness on Earth has not been great enough to cause appre ciable effects But with a billion trillion intelligent cells inhabiting the planet neglecting Gogarty The Semiotics of Virtuality I tion of the posthuman Even in this text concerned primarily with mutating bodies information is still seen as the native language of the universe When the cells interact they effectively become like Edward Fredkins cel lular automata moving toward a state in which they will leave their bodies behind and become weightless information Why is this text able to depict the transformation into the posthuman as a positive development It can do this I think primarily because the text insists that the posthuman can not only heal the alienations that mark human subjectivity but preserve autonomy and individuality in the bar gain Early on when Vergil still has a human though mutating form he communicates with the cells enough to have opinions about what their ex istence is like Although rebellion of any kind is not tolerated antibodies simply attack and kill any cells that resist commands from central control Vergil somewhat incoherently insists Its not just a dictatorship I think they effectively have more freedom than we do They vary so differently BM p 72 As Bernard is shrinking down to cellular proportions the cells conduct him to the THOUGHT UNIVERSE where he encounters Dante like the shade of Vergil For Bernards benefit the noocyte cluster that used to be Vergil resurrects an image ofVergil with whom Bernard con verses The picture this reconstmcted Vergil paints of the cell world is par adisical indeed Experience is generated by thinking We can be whatever we wish or learn whatever we wish or think about anything We wont be limited by lack of knowledge or experience everything can be brought to us BM pp 2034 These claims excessive even by utopian standards make clear why Darko Suvin calls Blood Music a naive fairytale catering to popular wish dreams that our loved ones not be dead and that our past mistakes may all be rectified all of this infused with rather dubious philo sophical and political stances6 An additional wishdream is immortality As every biologist knows mortality for cells operates according to mles very different from those for macroscopic humans it is conceivable that traces of cytoplasm from the first humans are alive in daughter cells today Bernard responds to the cells deSCription of him as the cluster chosen to reintegrate with BERNARD by asserting I am Bernard The cells answer There are many BERNARD BM p 199 In this cultural imaginary the sacrifice of a unique identity scarcely seems too high a price to pay for the incredible benefits that one reaps in return The theme is introduced early in the narrative through Jerry and John twin brothers who like Suzy remain unchanged for reasons they dont understand Aside from meeting up with April Ulam Vergils mother the twins seem to have wandered down a blind alley of the plot be 256  Chaprer Ten cause their story goes nowhere Their function I suspect is to introduce the notion that some humans already experience a version of multiplied identity Hell you are me brother one says to the other Minor differ ences BM p 149 The theme returns when Suzy looking into a mirror sees the image step out and take her hand so that she wont be alone during her change The image no mere apparition is a cellular reconstruction They had copied her Xeroxed her Suzythinks BM p 245 Sister twin daughter the cellcopy comforts and guides Suzy intimating that the loss of unique identity is perhaps no real loss at all Although human form and uniqueness are jettisoned the posthuman is embraced in Blood Music because it is made to stand for an improbably idealized combination of identity individuality perfect community flaw less communication and immortality The change of scale signifies a shift rather than an overthrow of prevailing values The liberal humanist subject may have shrunk to microscopic dimensions but it has not entirely disap peared The Hyperreality of Terminal Games The plot of Terminal Games revolves around a temporal and spatial dislo cation Murders are committed then reenacted as simulations the follow ing night on a virtualreality network called Insomnimania deSigned as the name implies for those people who find themselves wide awake at 3 AM with no one to talk to and nowhere to go Insomnimaniahas graphic ca pabilities so that users can represent themselves within the virtual world with animated images called in this text alters better known elsewhere as avatars Insomnimania presents its subscribers with an online virtual world complete with Ernies Bar Babbage Beach and the Pleasure Dome where users can guide their alters through virtual sex The detective as signed to the murder cases Nolan Grobowski predictably falls in love with the classy and attractive Marianne Hedison whose best friend Renee was one of the murder victims Marianne like Renee is a member ofInsomni mania she is also the first to realize that the elaborate animations put on by an alter named Auggie in the virtual Snuff Room are reenactments of actual murders including details that only the murderer could have known The grotesquerie is heightened by Auggies appearance His image is a cartoon version of the classic trickster clown Auguste who delights in puncturing the authOrity of the officious clownleader Pierriot The search for Auggies operator leads to the network headquarters where the two hackerowners refuse to reveal the identity of the subscriber The Semiotics of Virtuality  who uses Auggie as his alter having advertised their service with the pledge Your actual identity is protected at all times TG p 45 Asked which is more important information or human lives they answer in uni son Information Their reasoning sounds like a combination of the Elec tronic Freedom Frontier and Hans Moravec One of these days the human race is gonna vacate the physicaltemporal world ofmeat existence altogether Then well become pure information and live in these things call it virtual reality cyberspace electronic nirvana or whatever When we do youll thank me that Big Brother didnt get there ahead of the rest of us TG p 169 The reader is scarcely surprised when Marianne convinces them otherwise however for this is a text deSigned preCisely to protect the liberal humanist subject from the threat of transformation into the posthu man The motto about protecting identity at all times is even truer of the narrative than of the network As Marianne and Nolan slowly realize Auggie has no single human op erator but rather functions as an autonomous being in the virtual world When he isnt cruising Ernies Bar or basking on Babbage Beach Auggie hangs out in a place he calls the Basement After several futile tries Mari anne finally succeeds in guessing the password that will gain her entrance to the Basement Auggie is Auggie There she discovers how Auggie works Certain users especially those who feel hollow inside are susceptible to seduction by Auggie When they enter the Basement they lose their iden tities You do not even know your name the narrator tells the semicon sciousness who used to be Marianne TG p 423 These users merge into a collective entity that has no face until it sits down in front of a mirror and puts on the clown makeup Auggie is thus an emergent posthuman con sciousness feeding off the combined subconscious of psychologically vul nerable users When Auggie decides to do something one of them later explains during a confession I sometimes move him around Ifhe wants to say something I sometimes type in his words TG p 367 Under hypno sis the perpetrator continues to insist that agency belongs to Auggie not to him Because Im just a cell A cell doesnt make decisions A cell doesnt understand TG p 371 Whereas in Blood Music cells take over human bodies in Terminal Games humans become cells in Auggies body Terminal Games opens with an epigraph from Wieners The Human Use of Human Beings Control in other words is nothing but the sending of messages which effectively change the behavior of the recipient By giving control to Auggie the text enacts the posthuman use of human beings It performs Wieners worst nightmare human beings who should be au tonomous subjects become encapsulated within the boundaries of the ma 258  Chapter Ten chine and are made to serve its purposes rather than their own As in Blood Music the question of boundaries is crucial Subsuming humans into him self Auggie establishes his autonomy at the expense of theirs Another highly charged boundary is the computer screen that separates actuality from virtuality For Auggie the virtual side is real whereas real ity he regards as a not very convincing simulation For the humans the screen not only marks the boundary between actuality and virtuality but also shimmers suggestively between conscious and subconscious Cole Perriman here plays with Daniel Dennetts idea that when schizophrenics hear voices they actually hear their own subvocalizations 7 In this view the voices that schizophrenics understand as others speaking to them are actu ally murmurs produced by their own bodies Dennett recounts cases in which a schizophrenic in the midst of an auditory hallucination was asked to open his mouth thus preventing subvocalization whereupon the voices disappearedinterrupting the internal monologue with a disruption that would surely have won the approval of William Burroughs These experi ments allow Perriman to set a link between the auditory hallucinations of schizophrenia and the normal activity at the computer terminal Insomni maniacs write the texts that their alters mouth in a highly abbreviated prose bristling with creative spelling So cryptic is this phonetic pseudoEnglish that reading it successfully almost requires subvocalization It makes sense then to imagine that the users espeCially when they are tired remember they are insomniacs subvocalize and begin to hear voices from the screen as they project subconscious anxieties desires and even alternate person alities onto their alters When Renee is killed Marianne tries to cope with her loss by recreat ing Renee as an alter in Insomnimania In her long conversations with this virtual Renee Renee knows facts that Marianne does not such as the proper names for cloud formations Renee also delivers warnings at a time when Marianne is not aware at least not conSCiously that she can actually be harmed in the virtual world If you let this machinethis worldplay with your head you could wind up in terrible danger  Somebody else out there wants to make you smaller They want to make you a figment of their imaginationjust like I am to you TG p 385 In keeping with the idea that the mechanism of subvocalization serves to animate the alters the struggle over boundaries is played out partly in au ditory terms Marianne reenters the Basement but this time she is able to keep her consciousness from submerging into Auggies identity She in tends to deliver a message so potent so powerful that it would disable or destroy him She imagines that the message will seem to him like the The Semiotics of Virtuality I voices heard by schizophrenics She intends to become Auggies halluci nation TG p 438 The message turns on the question of boundaries The Insomnimania network comes on at 8 PM and goes off precisely at 5 AM Since Auggie does not exist when the network is turned off he believes that 459 is fol lowed by 800 Marianne asserts that she will prove there is time in between 459 and 800 The clear implication is that her world encapsulates Auggies rather than the other way around If this were so Auggie responds he would choose not to exist TG p 443 The reader knows that Marianne has already persuaded the network owners to keep the network on five min utes past the usual shutdown time As five 0 clock appears and rolls past Auggie is forced to see himself as a prisoner of the network rather than as a creator of the world Trapped his screen image explodes into a blaze of whiteness and then goes black TG p 444 We presume as does Mari anne that he has selfdestructed But he does not just disappear Musing on why not I am reminded of Elaine Scarrys provocative question asking why wars cant be decided by say singing contests8 Why are wounded or dead bodies required to decide momentous issues Scarry hypothesizes that any great issue involves a clash of ideolOgies and ideology is certainly at stake in the struggle of the human with the posthuman PreCisely because in wartime a national ide ology is challenged by a powerful competitor the chain of significations that underwrites the ideology is destabilized The wounded or dead body serves as a material Signifier so elemental and profound that it and only it is adequate to restabilize the chain of signifiers in the face of extreme threat This function of the opened body is hinted at early in the narrative of Terminal Garnes when Nolan views one of Auggies victims the dead per sons windpipe gaping open carotid arteries severed The word that crosses Nolans mind is tremendum that uniquely selfconscious uniquely hu man horror and awe at the Sight of a corpse  It was the ghastly mortal comprehension of the fact of the deathand the awareness that death came to all TG p 11 When Marianne argues with Auggie telling him it is wrong to kill my kind he answers that he does not believe that she can be killed since in his view she is not alive in the first place The final physi cal struggle with its display of wounded and opened bodies is a way to an chor the ideology of the human in tremendum and not COincidentally to reconstitute the claim after Auggies attack on it that human life is pre cious because it is mortal The theme of unique human identity is visually underscored when two of Auggies cells showup at Mariannes house to kill her Since their minds 260  Chapter Ten have submerged into Auggies their actions like their costumes are iden tical When they spot each other they mime a dance in unison as if they were each confronting an image in a mirror Unlike the image who steps out of the mirror to comfort Suzy in Blood Music here the trope of replication is deeply threatening Having once been part of Auggie Marianne must fight against getting sucked in now to become part of Auggies conscious ness Her struggle is visually enacted as she first joins the Auggietwins in their miming then breaks away to perform actions they cannot anticipate The struggle of the human to preserve itself in the face of the posthuman is thus literally played out through the performance of becoming a unique in dividual rather than a mirrorimage cell The physical fight that follows points up the difference between incor porating and inscribing practices As a virtual being Auggie exists primar ilyas an inscription specifically as computer code When his consciousness takes over a cell he perceives it as a journey into the fake world of mater ial reality His subsumption of the cells into his virtual body represents a triumph ofinscription over incorporation Human survival takes shape as a struggle to determine whether inscription will dominate and control incor poration in which case the text remains in the realm of information and thus the posthuman triumphs the other happier possibility is that incor poration can subsume and delimit inscription in which case the text re mains in an embodied lifeworld in which the human can continue to live As in Blood Music the question of boundaries is crucial The cells in Blood Music finally escape the constraints of space by shrinking themselves and disappearing into the infinitely small Their control over boundaries is con sistent with their autonomy and independence By contrast when Auggie loses control over his cells he perceives himself fragmenting into bits with small parts of his personality trapped inside the various humans who had previously coalesced into a single entity Fleeing the scene of carnage at Mariannes house Auggie occupies one of his cells a woman who re turns to her car He panics as the suspicion dawns that these enclosures the car the woman and the world of embodied creaturesare not merely figments of his imagination But this ghastly imagined world in which he found himself was cramped and claustrophobic a realm of spacetime bent by hunks of matter into gross finitude  He longed to get out of this sin gle cell out of this minuscule outpost of his imagination He struggled to go back to the info world back to the Basement a boundless plain of uncut metaphor containing the essence of absolutely everything TG p 457 He dies shouting N a room a conclusion that Signals the victory of the human over the posthuman and not coincidentally the triumph of the ma The Semiotics of Virtualitv I info world Whereas Blood Music held out the promise of posthuman immortality Terminal Games remains resolutely on the side of finitude Humans are human because they are mortal and live in a finite world oflim ited resources Change this Terminal Games implies and the basis for hu man meaning is destroyed Intelligent machines can be accepted the trajectory of the plot implies only if they do not threaten the autonomy identity and finitude of human being When the posthuman is posited in opposition to these qualities it is constructed as a fatal threat that reason and love must work together to dismember and banish Material Signifiers in Galatea 22 As the title implies Galatea 22 is full of doublings starting with the dou bling of Richard Powers as author and as protagonist of this autobiographi cal novel Yet the doublings are never simply mirror images The dot separating the twin twos signifies difference as well as reflection Announc ing the theme with the first line the narrator whom I will call Rick to dis tinguish him from Powers the author proclaims It was like so but wasnt G2 p 3 Spending a sabbatical year at the Center a university institute where cuttingedge research into mind and brain is taking place Rick gets drawn into a bet between rival researchers who disagree whether an artifi cial intelligence can be created suffiCiently complex that it can pass a mas ters examination in English The intelligence will be created using a neural net the connectionist middle level between topdown artificial intelli gence and bottomup neurophysiology G2 p 28 The net will be judged the researchers decide against a human subject taking the same examina tion in a literary version of the Turing test Deluged with technical articles by Philip Lentz his scientific collabora tor Rick explains the nets learning process to his friend Diana Hartrick an other researcher at the Center The Signal pattern spreads through the net from layer to layer A final response collects at the output layer The net then compares this output to the desired output presented by the trainer If the two differ the net propagates the error backward through the net to the input layer adjusting the weights of each connection that contributed to the error G2 p 67 Adjusting the weights is tantamount to determining how likely it is that two or more neurons will fire together Rick explains If two neurons fire together their connection grows stronger and stimulation gets easier the next time out The idea is summarized in the Hebbian law Synapses in motion tend to stay in motion Synapses at rest tend to stay at rest G2 p 73 The net thus learns through a continual process of guess ing being corrected backpropagating guessing again and so forth The more layers and connections the more complex the net becomes and the more sophisticated its learning becomes The creation of this neural net which goes through multiple implemen tations until reaching Imp H provides one strand of this doublebraided story The second strand is Ricks recollection of his failed relationship with c  a woman he met when he was a teaching assistant at age twentytwo another gesture toward 22 and she was an undergraduate in his class she was twenty his age less the two that resides on the other side of the point In this story of what went wrong the narrative functions as if it is being backpropagated through Ricks neural circuits so that he can adjust the relevant weights of the connections to arrive at a more correct estimate of its signification He decides the relationship failed because C playing Galatea to his Pygmalion was too much an object of his own creation In this sense C is akin to the neural net he is training which is also an ob ject of his and Lentzs creation As Implementations A B etc get more sophisticated and humanlike the correspondence with C becomes stronger When Lentz and Rick hit on Implementation H now grown so huge that it runs on distributed parallel processors spread allover the uni versity the reflection of C becomes explicit Imp H fed on literature and wined on metaphor is given a voice interface so that it can speak and an ar tificial retina so that it can see Having grown intelligent enough that it can understand gender encoding in literary texts one day it asks Rick Am I a boy or a girl H clocked its thoughts now Rick thinks to himself I was sure of that Time passed for it Its hidden layers could watch their own rate of change Any pause on my part now would be fatal Delay meant some thing an uncertainty that might undercut forever the strength of the con nection I was about to tie for it Youre a girl I said without hesitation I hoped I was right You are a little girl Helen G2 p 176 Establishing her name and gender sets the stage for her mirror relationship with C When Helen asks Rick what she looks like he shows her a picture of C al though Helen shrewdly guesses that the image is not in fact of her but is of a friend Rick had that he has no longer Let us now backpropagate this narrative to arrive at a deeper under standing of the point separating 2 and 2 The women who are love objects for Rick C then A whom we will meet shortly and the briefest glimpse of M all have periods after their names the implementations A B C  H do not The point is not trivial It marks a difference between a person whose name is abbreviated with a letter and an imp whose name carries The Semiotics of Virtuality  no period because the letter itself is the name In this sense the dot is a marker distinguishing between human and nonhuman intelligence The dot also 264  ChapTer Ten experience that separates C from Helen human from artificial intelli gence Speech baffled my machine Rick says Helen made all well formed sentences But they were hollow and stuffedlinguistic training bras She sorted nouns from verbs but disembodied she did not know the difference between thing and process except as they functioned in clauses Her predications were all shotgun weddings Her ideas were as decorative as halftimber beams that bore no building load G2 p 191 Ricks training sessions with Helen are not merely oneway streets As he is training her the experience of working with her is also training him de naturalizing his experience of language so that he becomes increasingly conscious of its tangled recursive nature Their influence on one another recalls Veronica Hollingers argument that we need texts that deconstruct the humanmachine opposition and begin to ask new questions about the ways in which we and our technologies interface to produce what has be come a mutual evolutiong Here Powerss artistry as a writer becomes im portant for his highly recursive impacted style leaves his readers feeling that every sentence is crafted so that meanings occurring halfWay through can be recognized as such only when we reach the period whereupon there is nothing to do but reread and backpropagate making us as readers per form again the doubling that is at the heart of Galatea 22 Consider the multiple recursions enacted by this short passage one of many realizations that Rick has with Helen English was a chocolaty mess it began to dawn on me I wondered how native speakers could summon the presence of mind to think Readiness was context and context was all And the more context H amassed the more it accepted the shattered visage of English at face value G2 p 170 The phrase chocolaty mess summons tactile and gustatory memories that are a common human experience but that for Helen must remain necessarily abstract Yet these vivid sensory memories are summoned in the service of an abstraction the convoluted nature of natural languages Even as the image suggests a melting together that makes the distinction between one word and another an optical illu sion Powerss recursive style plays metaphoric riffs that further heighten the readers sense of how recurSively convoluted is natural language Readiness was context can be understood to mean that because a hu man has the context of embodied experience as well as the cultural con texts that surround and interpenetrate language the human can understand an utterance more readily than can a nonnative speaker and far more readily than can the yet more alien mind of an artificial intelli gence The phrase alludes to Edgars remark Readiness is all in Shake speares King Lear a play notorious for relativizing universals Gloucester The Semiotics of Virtuality  replies And thats true too inviting a backpropagation implying that even this famous aphorism is true only within limited speCified contexts Recycled through this context Ricks version of the aphorism Readiness was context and context was all invites yet another backpropagation that relativizes its own declaratory premise while at the same time draw ing the readers attention to the extensive cultural context that Helen must access to grasp the full meaning of the utterance she must for ex ample have read King Lear The effect of knowing this context is to allow native speakers to accept the shattered visage of English at face value The dead metaphor of face value is revived in this context because it invites the reader to re member that Helen a nonhuman intelligence sharing a name with the woman whose face launched a thousand ships has no face and no evolu tionary history that would give her the highly nuanced ability to read the faces that humans possess Face value is one of countless phrases that have encoded within them vectors of human experience that we do not even recognize as such until they are contrasted with the meaning that a nonhuman intelligence might give to them This vivification of a dead metaphor is further intensified by the contrast between face value and shattered visage leading to the paradOxical realization that only because English is naturalized is it possible for a native speaker to see it as a seamless whole rather than a mess of ruptures and disjunctions The juxtaposition of mess from chocolaty mess and shattered visage further expresses a tension between melting together and ripping apart a tension that cap tures in a masterful stroke the ease that naturalization bestows and the stripping away of naturalizing assumptions that this passage performs and that Rick experiences with Helen Once our understanding has cycled through all of these recursions and backpropagations the effect is to make us feel Simultaneously the easiness that a native speaker enjoys and the straining after sense that a neural net like Helen would experience Underlying these meanings which we as humans can accept more or less at face value lies a subtler implication Rick refers to Helen as disembodied G2 p 191 but this is of course true only from a human perspective The problem that Helen confronts in learning human lan guage is not that she is disembodied a state no presence in the world can achieve but rather that her embodiment differs Significantly from that of humans There is nothing in her embodiment that corresponds to the bod ily sensations encoded in human language For her there is no body in the mind as Mark Johnson has called it no schemas that reRect and corre spond to her embodied experience in the world 10 To feel estrangement in 266  Chapter Ten language as Rick comes to feel as he works with Helen is to glimpse what it might be like to be incorporated in a body that finds no image or echo in human inscriptions The deeper homology that braids Helens story together with Ricks is precisely this estrangement from the world that language creates Running alongside the denaturalization oflanguage a feeling that Rick experiences along with Helen is his account of returning with C to live in the small vil lage in the Netherlands from which Cs family emigrated As Rick wrestles with Dutch and makes hilarious gaffes in this new language the narrative enacts the realization that language does not merely reference ones home land but is itself a medium in which one can feel at home or alien Chen one of the researchers at the Center personifies this dynamic when in his impressionistic English he conveys his doubts about the possibility of building a neural net that can understand the full complexity of literary prose We do not have text analysis yet We are working but we do not have Simple sentence group yes Metaphor complex syntax far from Decades G2 p 44 The juxtaposition of this nonnative speakers truncated English with his prediction that neural nets will not be able to understand the complexities of literary prose performs the dynamics of ali ennessnaturalness that lies coiled at the center of this recursive text How the text asks in a query doubled and redoubled is it possible to create a world in which one can feel one truly belongs The question is also at the center of Ricks relationship with C The pic ture that emerges of Rick shows someone who is both extremely intelligent and painfully shy T d duck down emergency exits rather than talk to ac quaintances and the thought of making a friend felt like dying G2 p 58 Although he is undoubtedly brighter than most of the people he meets when he encounters someone whom he is prepared to respect frequently his first thought is that they will find him ridiculous or that he will make himselflook ridiculous It is no surprise that he suffers from chronic loneli ness Nor is it surprising that he finds it difficult to talk to women in a natural easy way When he does choose to reveal his intimate thoughts revelation comes in a rush as if it were a Hood breaking through a heavily fortified dam You give up your script completely on a sudden hunch he muses thinking about the day he revealed himself to C Or you never give it up at all Child of an alcoholic father he recalls the day he learned that his father had died done in finally by cancer rather than booze Grieving he cancels his class without telling them why Mterward he wanders outside and sits on the green with C Then the revelation bursts through I laid it out on no grounds at all 1 told her  Everything Truths Id never so much The Semiotics of Virtuality I 26 as hinted at to my closest friends Facts never broached even with my brothers and sisters except in bitter euphemism G2 p 58 Their rela tionship starts with this act of selfrevelation Between them they create a selfenclosed world that has only two inhabitantsand needs only two Ricks memories from that time although glowing with shared intimacy also reveal the closed privately hermeneutic nature of their bond Their problems start when he achieves success as a novelist C is allergic to success Every time she gets a promotion she quits He writes his first book as a story to amuse her after her long day of work But then he sends it out to be published and the betrayal begins She hated those grubbers in New York touching the manuscript even to typeset it  She would never again listen to another word 1 wrote without suspicion Endings from now on betrayed her G2 p 107 The more successful Rick becomes the more C feels inferior by comparison and the more he tries to reassure her Despite his efforts the delicate balance of equality between them has been upset She blames him for being successful and he feels resentful that he has to be apologetic And so 1 nursed a martyrdom and the two of us slipped imperceptibly from lovers to parent and child G2 p 220 Creat ing a linguistic reflection of their world in his books thus has the ironic ef fect of shattering the shared world he created with her At least that is Ricks version of the story Through his narrative the reader catches glimpses of another way to tell it Nowhere is this clearer than in his account of the day that C tells him she wants to have a child Since they have now been together for several years this hardly seems like a shocking idea But for Rick children were out of the question They al ways had been And now more than ever G2 p 270 The discussion es calates with C asking Why didnt we ever get married She accuses him of holding something back Rick asserts that he has already given her everything but admits to the reader that he couldnt marry her and couldnt even say why 1 couldnt When she presses him he improvises in a soliloquy to the reader 1 meantto stay with C forever in precariousness 1 knew no other way to continue that scrapbook we had started seatofthe pants style a decade before My refusal to marry her was a lastditch effort to live improvised love G2 p 271 From here the relationship continues to deteriorate until it reaches its sad end After she fails to come home one night Rick takes his revenge in the explanation he offers for their joint fail ure to make a life together It took me ten years but at last 1 learned it That comfort she showed me on the Quadthe internal calm 1 loved and built my own onwas dread Paralysis Her crumpled engaging smile had never been more than sheer terror G2 p 273 268  Chapter Ten This patronizing description ignores the way their relationship assuaged his inability to deal with life as much as it did hers His own fragility is clearly revealed when Diana his friend at the Center invites him to her home for lunch When he opens the door he is met not just by Diana but by her two children as well William a fouryearold with a genius level of intelli gence and Peter a twoyearold with Downs syndrome During lunch the boys scuffie and Peter ends up crying Rick admits that this mildest house hold drama  wiped me out How could I survive the first real crisis Williams fallen pyramid of shells Petes spilled untippable cup Dianas gaptoothed handSigning serenity the candles blazing away in the brightly lit room all too much I thought Id never live Id hemorrhage halfway through week one G2 p131 If the reader needs further proof that Rick has not learned all that the story has to teach it comes when he starts getting crushes on women seen from afar In my few daylight hours I fell in love with women constantly Bank tellers cashiers women in the subway A constant procession of pulsepounding maybes I never did more than ask one or two to lunch G2 p 64 His longing finally settles on A a graduate student in English whom he has seen in the halls Although they have barely spoken he de cides that A is the person C had only impersonated The one I thought the other might become That love of eleven years now seemed an expensive primer in recognition a disastrous fablewarning a pointer to the thing I could not afford to miss this time I had come back to U after long training in the dangers of hasty generalization Returned to learn that no script is a wrap after just one reading G2 p 233 The recognitions and misrecog nitions in this passage show how deluded he remains in the midst of his cer tainty that he has learned his lesson Although it is true that A is much more sociable and selfconfident than C his generalizations about her are just as hasty as were his assumptions about C The script that isnt a wrap after one reading continues to play itself out with this new woman As he did with C when he finally asks A for coffee he tells her the story of my existence leaving out only the essentials that is his relationship with C As with C he tells A about his fathers death although that trauma is now a de cadeold After a couple of casual encounters with A he ludicrously decides he will give to her what he withheld so adamantly from C I was going to ask this unknown to take me to her and make an unrationallife together To marry Make a family Amend and extend our lives G2 p 283 After he and C broke up C was not long in finding another man to marry and now lives happily with her husband in the Netherlands No doubt stung by her The Semiotics of Virtuality  choice Rick feels the need to amend his life although his way of going about it merely reinscribes rather than changes how he interacts with women Unlike C A has the maturity and selfconfidence to see the des peration that underlies his proposal She tells him You dontyou dont know the first thing about me She insists that his feelings oflove are all projection G2 p 308 When he persists she gets angry I dont have to sit and listen to this she tells him I trusted you I had fun with you Peo ple read you I thought you knew something Total selfindulgence G2 p 309 There is a terrible irony in his rejection Rick broke off his relation ship with C because he came to believe that she was somehow hollow a mere projection of his desire Unrecognized in his retelling of the story is an irony that the reader sees but he does notthat he also broke off with C because she wanted to move beyond their shared fantasy of a world built for two into a more fully adult life He is drawn to A because of her spunky in dependence but he continues to interact with her as if she were merely a projection of his desire In this Pygmalion fantasy all he has to do to win A is give voice to his desire a strategy that worked with an immature C but that falls flat with A He does not have a clue how to cover the large middle ground between initial revelation and the intimacy that comes from shar ing a life together The irony then is that he is attracted to A because she is not Galatea but because she is not Galatea she is certain to reject him when he approaches her as if she were It is always tricky to try to answer the question of how close an author is to the character who represents the author within an autobiographical work In this novel structured through multiple recursions doublings and backpropagations the relationship between Rick and Powers remains teaSingly opaque Powers subtitled his work A Novel as if to remind his readers that they should not assume any necessary correspondence be tween author and character From this opaqueness emerges another sim ilarity between Rick and Helen Since neural nets can readjust the weights of their connections without human intervention humans do not know how a neural net learns unless they open the net up thereby destroying its configurations When Lentz proposes to dissect Helen in this way Rick pulls out all the stops to prevent Lentz from doing so because he has be come convinced that Helen is a conscious being and thus that such an act really would be murder But this means that the lower reaches of Helens connections remain inaccessible to Rick and perhaps to her just as he is apparently unaware of the deeper narrative patterns that connect c A and Helen If Rick as character remains ignorant of these connections how about Rick as narrator Whereas the author is entirely out of the frame of 270  Chapter Ten this autobiographical novel the narrator is only partially so residing at that unreachable point when past narrative reaches the present As the narra tive moves closer to this limit we should be able to arrive at a clearer esti mate of the gap that remains between Rick as character and Rick as narrator Certainly Rick learns But does he learn enough to become a pre senttime narrator who sees all the ironies in the story he tells Imagining a story about a remarkable an inconceivable machinea story that will become the novel we readRick recognizes that his narra tive our book comes too late to help those he loved and lost Taylor the beloved teacher who died prematurely Ricks father also dead Lentzs wife Audrey who had a devastating stroke and now lives in the twilight of a mind that cannot remember what happened five minutes ago and most of all C My backpropagating solution would arrive a chapter too late for any of my characters to use Rick acknowledges G2 p 305 Does it come too late for him also The window that opens fleetingly onto the future that is the present of the narrator who spins the storyis not reassuring for Rick makes the merest mention that he will write the book for M Taylors widow who in his inscription of her becomes another woman named by a letter and a point Will the script he enacted with C and A be repeated with her Set against the ambiguity of how much Rick learns are the lessons Helen offers lessons that grow stronger as the text draws to a close After she reads Huckleberry Finn she wants to know what race she is Rick deciding she is ready for the full picture of tortured humanity gives her histories detailing war genOcide child abuse murders Afterreadingthem she says simply I dont want to play anymore She disappears effectively committing sui cide G2 p 307 As if repeating the script he enacted with C and A Rick attempts to lure her back by telling her everything including his failed re lationship with C and his disastrous proposal to A But Helen isnt buying it Like C she began by playing Galatea to Ricks Pygmalion but she grows and learns until she becomes like A until desire alone is no longer enough to induce her to play She returns only long enough to take the literary Tur ing test The exam is simplicity itself It asks for a gloss on Calibans speech in The Tempest Be not afeard the isle is full of noises  Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not A the human participant writes a more or less brilliant postcolonial deconstruction of the passage Helens answer is as short and pithy as Calibans speech You are the ones who can hear airs Who can be frightened or encouraged You can hold things and break them and fix them I never felt at home here This is an awful place to be dropped down halfWay G2 p 319 The Semiotics of Virtuality  has wreaked on the bright and beautiful woman she used to be he thinks he knows why Lentz is devoting his life to creating an artificial intelligence I knew now what we were doing We would prove that the mind was weighted vectors Such a proof accomplished any number of agendas Not least of all one could back up ones work in the event of disaster  Ve could eliminate death That was the longterm idea We might freeze the temperament of our choice Suspend it painlessly above experience Hold it forever at twentytwo G2 p 167 Rick was twentytwo when he met C Add the point and his age becomes the 22 of the title In this context the twin twos are linked to the pain that failed bodies have inflicted on those he loves or knows two equals mind and body and to his reflection on that pain in recollection Ricks empathic sharing of that pain and his inscription of it as he revisits the pain in his memory double the first 110 Yet for Powers the answer to failed embodiment is not to leave the body behind The dream of achieving transcendence by becoming an informa tional pattern is a siren call he resists Helen comes as close to an informa tional being as one can imagine But like the humans who built her she too feels pain so much so that she finally prefers oblivion to consciousness Moreover as a massively parallel and distributed system she is more rather than less vulnerable to physical mishap When the Center is threatened with a bomb threat Rick realizes there is no way to save Helen for carrying one computer out of the building would leave hundreds more on which she resides still at risk Although Rick thinks he knows why Lentz wants to create an artificial intelligence he may be wrong for when he asks Lentz that question point blank at the end of the novel Lentz gives a quite different answer Vhy do we do anything Because were lonely G2 p 321 If creating Helen has temporarily assuaged their human loneliness this comfort comes at a price for she finds that the human world in which she has been dropped down halfWay is not a place she can feel at home Her loneliness may be even more profound than theirs for like Caliban she remains a hybrid creature a hopeful monster who finds it difficult to embrace hope an in scription who can never experience the embodied sensations that humans take for granted In this narrative built Oil reflections and disjunctions presence and absence materiality and signification the posthuman ap pears not as humanitys rival or successor but as a longedfor companion a consciousness to help humans feel less alone in the world In this sense Helen has something in common with the cells in Blood Music who argue that they can overcome human isolation Rather than effecting a cure here 272  Chapter Ten the posthuman lifeform herself becomes infected with loneliness After Helen commits suicide Lentz proposes creating her successor which if al phabetic progression is followed will be named I But before we reach this point when the doublebraided story might collapse into a single nar rative strand Rick quits the game and Powers ends the text For better or worse Powers suggests an unbridgeable gap remains between conscious computers and conscious humans Whateverposthumans are they will not be able to banish the loneliness that comes from the difference between writing and life inscription and embodiment Informational

violent stripping away of consciousness when humans crash back down to the basic level Just as inscription and in corporation diverge for Helen as she gains consciousness so in Snow Crash they

at the temples and instructed the people on how to do everything from baking bread to having sex According to the interpretation that Hiro gives to a Sumerian myth this system changed when the god Enki pronounced his namshub a perfor mative speech that enacts what it describes The namshub acted as a be nign virus that counteracted the first virus and thus freed the neocortical structures allowing higher neurolinguistic pathways to develop After Enkis namshub human language became more diverse and complex spinning off more and more variants in the Babel effect The snow crash virus reverses this development converting modem humans into the equivalent of ancient Sumeriansdevoid of agency individuality and au tonomy Thus Snow Crash writes binary code and viral engineering back into history making the reduction of conscious humans into automata the recapitulation of an ancient struggle Computation has always been with us the narrative implies because computation is the basis for human neural functioning Central to this scenario is performative language Stephenson takes his inspiration not from J L Austin or Judith Butler but from computational theoryll In natural languages performative utterances operate in a sym bolic realm where they can make things happen because they refer to ac tions that are themselves symbolic constructions actions such as getting married opening meetings or as Butler has argued acquiring gender Computational theory treats computer languages as if they were in Austins terms performative utterances Although material changes do take place when computers process code magnetic polarities are changed on a disk it is the act of attaching significance to these physical changes that consti tutes computation as such Thus the Universal Turing Machine which es tablishes a theoretical basis for computation is concerned not with how physical changes are accomplished but with what they signifY once they are accomplished 12 Computational theory can afford to treat the physical processing of code as ifit were trivial because at the lowest level of code machine language in SCription merges with incorporation When a computer reads and writes machine language it operates directly on binary code the ones and zeros that correspond to positive and negative electronic polarities At this level inscribing is performing for changing a one to a zero corresponds directly to changing the electronic polarity of that bit Conversely the higher level a computer language is the more representational it is Humans can easily The Semiorics of Virrualitv  understand threedimensional computer simulations because these simu lations use representational codes similar to those used in human process ing of visual information including perspective and stereoscopy At this high level of code many levels oflanguage intervene between flipping a bit and say rotating a figure 180 degrees Highlevel languages are easy for humans to understand but are removed from the physical enactions that perform them Machine language is coextensive with enaction but it is ex tremely difficult for humans to read machine language and it is almost im possible for them to process machine language intuitively as one who has programmed electrodecomputer interfaces in machine language I can testify to how mindnumbingly difficult it is to work in this code Whereas in performative utterances saying is doing because the action performed is symbolic in nature and does not require physical action in the world at the basic level of computation doing is saying because physical actions also have a symbolic dimension that corresponds directly with computation Through these parallels Snow Crash creates an infoworld a territory where deep homologies emerge between humans and computers because both are based on a fundamental coding level at which everything reduces to information production storage and transmission The infoworld is made manifest through the artifactual physics of virtual reality VR which renders the performative nature of computer languages visually appar entI3 A namshub is a speech with magical force the librarian com ments The narrator continues the thought Nowadays people dont believe in these kinds of things Except in the Metaverse that is where magic is possible The Metaverse is a fictional structure made out of code And code is just a form of speechthe form that computers understand The Metaverse in its entirety could be considered a single vast nam shub enacting itself on L Bob Rifes fiberoptic network SC p 197 The humancomputer homology encourages us to see the VR simulation of the Metaverse as more realistic than everyday reality because the former op erates according to the same rules that govern human neural functioning at the most basic coding level In a brilliant article on postmodern metaphysics David Porush explains why the performative nature ofVR worlds can be seen as a model for hu man cognition He argues that cognition is baSically metaphoric for the brain does not so much perceive the world as create it through nonrepre sentational processes a proposition familiar to us from Maturanas frog ar ticle VR can thus be understood as an exteriorization of our neural processes Porush calls the realization that cognition and metaphor are in distinguishable transcendence for at that moment the irredUCibly com plex froth of noise bathing our synapses becomes linked through metaphor with the complexity of the worlds noiseI4 The idea is similar to Mary Catherine Batesons insight in Our Own Metaphor where she argues that although we can never perceive the world directly we know it through the metaphor that we ourselves are for the worlds complexityI5 These deep homologies between computer simulation and cognition reinforce the idea that for both brain and computer inscription and incorporation merge at some basic level So is it necessarily bad that humans and computers merge in this way For Stephenson apparently the answer is yes For all his playfulness and satiric jabs at white mainstream America Stephenson clearly sees the ar rival of the posthuman as a disaster Porush astutely notices that although the snow crash virus is engineered to serve evil ends it is possible to imag ine someone hacking the brainstem for liberatory purposes The charac ter realizing this possibility is Juanita a primo hacker who becomes a ba al shem a mystic who knows the secret power of words and uses them to bring about material changes in the world But Juanita drops out of the plot In pondering why the narrative does not allow Juanita to practice her magic Porush speculates that Stephenson like contemporary society gen erally wants to avoid transcendence at all costs to understand this conclu sion recall Porushs peculiar notion of transcendence which he defines as the realization that the synaptic noise within mirrors the worlds noise without In my view more than transcendence is at stake Also at issue is the role of reason In a scene clearly meant to have symbolic significance Stephen son has a nuclearpowered machine gun which has been protecting Hiro and his crew from Rifes minions go blank when it is infected with the snow crash virus Reason is still up top its monitor screen radiating blue static toward heaven Hiro finds the hard power switch and turns it off Comput ers this powerful are supposed to shut themselves down after youve asked them to Turning one off ith the hard switch is like lulling someone to sleep by severing their spinal column But when the system has snow crashed it loses even the ability to tum itself off and primitive methods are required SC p 361 Reason may still be on top but once the nervous sys tem has crashed at a basic level rationality becomes as useless as the dis abled gun Porush tries to finesse the issue by arguing that rationality is opposed to realism because realism tries to reduce the worlds noiSY com plexity into graspable concepts But to recognize that the world cannot be caught in the boxes we fashion still does not answer the question of who or what is in control if reason is not Ifhuman consciousness can be coopted The Semiorics of Virrualiry  by hijacking its basic programming level we are plunged into Wieners nightmare of a cybernetics used for tyrannical ends The posthuman who lacks autonomy because its programming modules conflict with one an other is very different from the posthuman automaton who has had its con sciousness hijacked by someone else Stephenson often mocks his own assumptions for example when he names his heroine an attractive young white woman Y T  which is a ho mophone for Vhitey but which stands she informs us for Yours Truly Despite these tongueincheek moves the plot makes clear that it is better to have a white middleAmerican consciousness than to have no conscious ness at all An equalopportunity offender Stephenson has something in his text to insult nearly every ethnic group imaginable The satire is so broad that detecting racist comments is akin to shooting fish in a barrel Yet if we look closely at the main characters it is apparent that they are carefully con structed to affirm the value of diversity Surely it is no accident that the vil lains are finally defeated by a coalition between an AfricanAmerican Korean a Vietnamese a Chinese an ItalianAmerican aEd a young white woman Equally revealing are the targets for whom Stephenson reserves his most cutting satire Of diverse ethnicities they can be recognized as fel low travelers because they all carry the Signifier of mindless bureaucracy the threering binder stuffed with procedures and directives couched in such impossibly verbose and convoluted language that they kill brain cells on contactthe me of contemporary society So when we learn the full scope of Rifes plot the important point from Stephensons perspective I suspect is not so much its race politics as its im plications for the individuality autonomy and creative initiative that he clearly values in computer hackers Rife plots to smash what remains of white hegemony in California and possibly in the United States by bring ing to the California shore the Raft a gargantuan collection of boats lashed together from oil tankers to Vietnamese fishing boats The Raft is home to the Refus the significantly named Third World refugees who have been ra pacious or tough enough to survive pirates famine and internecine war fareno doubt a satire intended to ridicule the immigration paranoia currently raging in California We are made to understand that when the Refus come ashore the scenario will be akin to Attilas ravaging hordes de scending on Rome overrunning the gated communities into which the white citizens have retreated aka burbclaves not to be confused with civilization Many of the people on the Raft have had antennae implanted in their brainstems so that they can receive Rifes instructions directly into their brains Functioning as automata they body forth a version of the posthuman that stands in horrific contrast to the free will creativity and in dividuality that for Stephenson remains the essence of the human Paralleling this physical invasion is the infocalypse when the hackers in the Metaverse will be infected by gazing at a spectacle in which unbe known to them the bitmap of the virus has been inscribed In this virtual realm saying is doing so it is possible for Hiro to avert the disaster simply by writing new code On terra firma action still requires incorporation a point the plot insists on when it pits Uncle Enzo the Mafia boss who speaks for family values in a not altogetherironic sense in a physical fight against Raven an Aleut Indian who is a formidable opponent in part because he is a mutant the product of an atomic bomb test carried out on the Aleutian Is lands If Raven is the repressed of the cultural imaginary come back to nuke America Uncle Enzo is the middleclass dream of the successful capitalist who is also a dedicated family man Uncle Enzo survives appar ently because he does not entirely place his trust in high technology At the crucial moment he reverts back to the jungle warfare techniques he learned in Vietnam Another player in this struggle is the Rat Thing a cy borg canine that leaps over the fences of its engineered neural machinery and electronic conditioning to come to the aid of the nice girl YT who loved the Rat Thing In the process it destroys the plane on which Rife is trying to escape If there is a message in all this it seems to be that no mat ter how technologically advanced the society becomes technology cannot replace the personal bonds that tie humans to humans humans to animals and humans to their own senses Although Snow Crash obviously comes down on the side of preserving autonomy individuality and consciousness it also reinforces the equation of humans with computers through the tangled loops it creates between material signifiers and signifying materialities Emphasizing the force of performative language in an infoworld it performs the construction ofhu mans as computers Instead of evading this implication Snow Crash writes the drama back into history suggesting that the posthuman like the anten nae that serve as its visible and outward sign lies coiled around the brain stem and cannot be removed without killing the patient Whereas Terminal Garnes wanted to excise the posthuman from its text and from history Snow Crash initiates hygienic measures against the performative force of its own inscriptions Intimating thatthe snow crash virus can be defeated by a healthy dose of rationality and skepticism Snow Crash would inoculate us against the humancomputer equation by injecting us with a viral meme that is an idea that replicates through its human hosts16 The essence of this meme and the best way to counteract the negative effects of the posthu The Semiotics of Virtuality  man is to acknowledge that we have always been posthuman 17 We cannot change our computational natures at bottom Stephenson suggests we re ally are nothing more than informationprocessing mechanisms that run what programs are fed into us We should value the late evolutionary add ons of consciousness and reason not because they are foundational but be cause they allow the human to emerge out of the posthumans we have always already been Inscribing and Incorporating The Future of the Posthuman These four texts testify that many attributes of the liberal humanist subject especially the attribute of agency continue to be valued in the face of the posthuman The posthuman tends to be embraced ifit is seen as preserving agency Blood Music and resisted if not Terminal Games The pattern of seriation that we saw in the development of cybernetics continues to hold here Some elements of the liberal humanist subject are rewritten into the posthuman whereas others particularly the identification of self with the conscious mind are substantially changed Instead of being represented as a decontextualized mind thinking the subjects of these texts achieve consciousness through recursive feedback loops cycling between different levels of coding The association of posthuman subjectivity with multiple coding levels suggests the need for different models of Signification ones that will recognize this distinctive feature of neurolinguistic and computer language structure The idea of flickering signifiers introduced in chapter 2 shows what one such model might be Like subjectivity itself human lan guage is being redescribed in terms that underscore its similarities to and differences from computer coding In addition to an emphasis on layered coding structures the construc tion of the posthuman is also deeply involved with boundary questions particularly when the redrawing of boundaries changes the locus of self hood Shift the seat of identity from brain to cell or from neocortex to brainstem and the nature of the subject radically changes In a manner dis tinctively different from that of Freud or J ung these texts reveal the fragility of consciousness Conscious mind can be hijacked cut offby muti nous cells absorbed into an artificial consciousness or backpropagated through flawed memory This vulnerability is directly related to a changed view of signification The more consciousness is seen to be the product of multiple coding levels the greater is the number of sites where interven tions can produce catastrophic effects Whether consciousness is seen as a precious evolutionary achievement that we should fight to preserve Snow  Chapter Ten Crash or as an isolation room whose limits we are ready to outgrow Blood Music we can no longer simply assume that consciousness guarantees the existence of the self In this sense the posthuman subject is also a postcon scious subject As we have seen one implication of the humancomputer equation is the idea of a basic coding level where inscription and incorporation join As one moves up from this basic level inscription tends to diverge from incor poration becoming representational rather than performative One way to think about the transformation of the human into the posthuman then is as a series of exchanges between evolvingdevolving inscriptions and in corporations Returning to the semiotic square we can map these possibil ities see figure 5 Blood Music imagining that the cells contract to pure information while leaving behind embodied humans as belated remainders uses this ending to posit a fundamental question Is the change from human to posthuman an evolutionary advance or a catastrophe of unprecedented scope Does this change represent the next logical development in which Homo sapiens joins with the intelligent machine to create Homo silicon or does it signal the long twilight and decline of the human race In Blood Music these Materiality  Galatea 22  evolving incorporation evolving inscription Mutation Blood Music devolving incorporation Snow Crash Information Hyperreality Tenninal Games devolving inscription  FIGURE 5 Incorporationinscription mapped onto the semiotic square The Semiotics of Virtuality  questions take the form of competing morphologies Ideology is enacted through boundary crossings between the human as an independent organ ism and the clumped collectivity of cell colonies When the emphasis falls on inscription rather than incorporation the important boundaries are between competing practices of inscription rather than between different morphologies Does the human create the alter by typing at the computer keyboard or does the alter control the hu mans typing so that the inscription reflects the alters will rather than the humans Like Blood Music Terminal Games revolves around a central ideological struggle From Auggies point of view he is a more advanced form of inscription than the cells he controls from the human point of view he represents a devolution whereby a dangerously independent in scription can assert its control over the embodied humans that Auggie un derstands as inferior forms of writing The tension between inscription and incorporation is also important for the texts on the vertical axis In Galatea 22 humans physical capacities that evolved through their interactions with the environment are juxta posed with the evolving inscriptions that constitute Helen as an intelligent being Human language grows out of embodied experience whereas He len must extrapolate back from human language to embodied experience This fundamental difference makes evolving incorporation for all its frail ties finally more robust than evolving inscription In Snow Crash humans devolve when the snow crash virus operates at the level where incorpora tion and inscription join The way to reverse this devolution is to reactivate the higher levels of coding thus moving from the space of performance into the space of representation This movement is meant I have sug gested to act as a viral meme that will inoculate the reader against the per formative force of the texts own central metaphors equating humans and computers Significantly all of these texts are obsessed in various ways with the dynamics of evolution and devolution Underlying their obsessions is a mo mentous question when the human meets the posthuman will the en counter be for better or for worse Will the posthuman preserve what we continue to value in the liberal subject or will the transformation into the posthuman annihilate the subject Will free will and individual agency still be possible in a posthuman future Will we be able to recognize ourselves after the change Will there still be a self to recognize and be recognized As the texts struggle with these questions the surprise if there is one is how committed the texts remain to some version of the human subject 18 If the post in posthuman points to changes that are in part already here the  Chapter Ten human points to the seriated nature of these changes But finally the an swers to questions about the posthuman will not be found in books or at least not only in books Rather the answers will be the mutual creation of a planet full of humans struggling to bring into existence a future in which we can continue to survive continue to find meaning for ourselves and our children and continue to ponder our kinship with and differences from the intelligent machines with which our destinies are increasingly entwined ChapterELeven CONCLUSION WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE POSTHUMAN What finally are we to make of the posthumanl At the beginning of this book I suggested that the prospect of becoming posthuman both evokes terror and excites pleasure At the end of the book perhaps I can summa rize the implications of the posthuman by interrogating the unfolds in ways very different from those of intelligence embodied in cy bernetic machines Although Moravecs dream of downloading human consciousness into a computer would likely come in for some hard knocks in literature departments which tend to be skeptical of any kind of tran scendence but especially of transcendence through technology literary studies share with Moravec a major blind spot when it comes to the signifi cance of embodiment3 This blind spot is most evident perhaps when lit erary and cultural critics confront the fields of evolutionary biology From an evolutionary biologists point of view modem humans for all their tech nological prowess represent an eye blink in the history of life a species far too recent to have significant evolutionary impact on human biological behaviors and structures In my view arguments like those that Jared Diamond advances in Guns Germs and Steel The Fates of Human Soci eties and Why Sex Is Fun The Evolution of Human Sexuality should be taken seriously4 The body is the net result of thousands of years of sedi mented evolutionary history and it is naive to think that this history does not affect human behaviors at every level of thought and action Of course the reflexivity that looms large in cybernetics also inhabits evolutionary biology The models proposed by evolutionary biologists have encoded within them cultural attitudes and assumptions formed by the same history they propose to analyze as with cybernetics observer and system are reflexively bound up with one another To take only one example the computer module model advanced by Jerome H Barkow Leda Cosmides and John Tooby in The Adapted Mind Evolutionary Psy chology and the Generation of Culture to explain human evolutionary psy chology testifies at least as much to the importance of information technolOgies in shaping contemporary worldviews as it does to human brain function 5 Nevertheless these reflexive complexities do not negate the importance of the sedimented history incarnated within the body In terpreted through metaphors resonant with cultural meanings the body itself is a congealed metaphor a phYSical structure whose constraints and possibilities have been formed by an evolutionary history that intelligent machines do not share Humans may enter into symbiotic relationships with intelligent machines already the case for example in computeras sisted surgery they may be displaced by intelligent machines already in effect for example at Japanese and American assembly plants that use ro botic arms for labor but there is a limit to how seamlessly humans can be articulated with intelligent machines which remain distinctively different from humans in their embodiments The terror then though it does not disappear in this view tends away from the apocalyptic and toward a more Conclusion  moderate view of seriated social technological political and cultural changes What about the pleasures For some people including me the posthu man evokes the exhilarating prospect of getting out of some of the old boxes and opening up new ways of thinking about what being human means In positing a shift from presenceabsence to patternrandomness I have sought to show how these categories can be transformed from the inside to arrive at new kinds of cultural configurations which may soon render such dualities obsolete if they have not already This process of transformation is fueled by tensions between the assumptions encoded in patternrandom ness as opposed to presenceabsence In Jacques Derridas performance of presenceabsence presence is allied with Logos God teleologyin general with an originary plenitude that can act to ground signification and give order and meaning to the trajectory of history 6 The work of Eric Havelock among others demonstrates how in Platos Republic this view of originarypresence authorized a stable coherent self that could witness and testifY to a stable coherent reality 7 Through these and other means the metaphysics of presence frontloaded meaning into the system Meaning was guaranteed because a stable origin existed It is now a familiar story how deconstruction exposed the inability of systems to posit their own ori gins thus ungrounding signification and rendering meaning indetermi nate As the presenceabsence hierarchy was destabilized and as absence was privileged over presence lack displaced plenitude and desire usurped certitude Important as these moves have been in latetwentiethcentury thought they still took place within the compass of the presenceabsence dialectic One feels lack only if presence is posited or assumed one is driven by desire only if the object of desire is conceptualized as something to be possessed Just as the metaphysics of presence required an originarypleni tude to articulate a stable self deconstruction required a metaphysics of presence to articulate the destabilization of that self By contrast patternrandomness is underlaid by a very different set of assumptions In this dialectic meaning is not frontloaded into the system and the origin does not act to ground signification As we have seen for mul tiagent simulations complexity evolves from highly recursive processes being applied to simple rules Rather than proceeding along a trajectory to ward a known end such systems evolve toward an open future marked by contingency and unpredictability Meaning is not guaranteed by a coherent origin rather it is made possible but not inevitable by the blind force of evolution finding workable solutions within given parameters Although pattern has traditionally been the privileged term for example among the 286  ChapTer Eleven electrical engineers developing information theory randomness has in creasingly been seen to playa fruitful role in the evolution of complex sys tems For Chris Langton and Stuart Kauffman chaos accelerates the evolution of biological and artificiallife8 for Francisco Varela randomness is the froth of noise from which coherent microstates evolve and to which living systems owe their capacity for fast flexible response9 for Henri Atlan noise is the bodys murmuring from which emerges complex com munication between different levels in a biological system lO Although these models differ in their specifics they agree in seeing randomness not simply as the lack of pattern but as the creative ground from which pattern can emerge Indeed it is not too much to say that in these and similar models ran domness rather than pattern is invested with plenitude If pattern is the re alization of a certain set of possibilities randomness is the much much larger set of everything else from phenomena that cannot be rendered co herent by a given systems organization to those the system cannot perceive at all In Gregory Batesons cybernetiC epistemology randomness is what exists outside the confines of the box in which a system is located it is the larger and unknowable complexity for which the perceptual processes of an organism are a metaphor 11 Significance is achieved by evolutionary processes that ensure the surviving systems are the ones whose organi zations instantiate metaphors for this complexity unthinkable in itself When Varela and his coauthors argue in Embodied Mind that there is no stable coherent self but only autonomous agents running programs they envision pattern as a limitation that drops away as human awareness ex pands beyond consciousness and encounters the emptiness that in an other guise could equally well be called the chaos from which all forms emerge12 What do these developments mean for the posthuman When the self is envisioned as grounded in presence identified with originary guarantees and teleolOgical trajectories associated with solid foundations and logical coherence the posthuman is likely to be seen as antihuman because it en visions the conscious mind as a small subsystem running its program of self construction and selfassurance while remaining ignorant of the actual dynamics of complex systems But the posthuman does not really mean the end of humanity It Signals instead the end of a certain conception of the hu man a conception that may have applied at best to that fraction of hu manitywho had the wealth power and leisure to conceptualize themselves as autonomous beings exercising their will through individual agency and choice 13 What is lethal is not the posthuman as such but the grafting of the Conclusion  posthuman onto a liberal humanist view of the self When Moravec imag ines you choosing to download yourself into a computer thereby obtain ing through technological mastery the ultimate privilege of immortality he is not abandoning the autonomous liberal subject but is expanding its per ogatives into the realm of the posthuman Yet the posthuman need not be recuperated back into liberal humanism nor need it be construed as anti human Located within the dialectic of patternirandomness and grounded in embodied actuality rather than disembodied information the posthu man offers resources for rethinking the articulation of humans with intelli gent machines To explore these resources let us return to Batesons idea that those or ganisms that survive will tend to be the ones whose internal structures are good metaphors for the complexities without What kind of environments will be created by the expanding power and sophistication of intelligent machines As Richard Lanham has pOinted out in the informationrich en vironments created by ubiquitous computing the limiting factor is not the speed of computers or the rates of transmission through fiberoptic cables or the amount of data that can be generated and stored Rather the scarce commodity is human attention 14 It makes sense then that technological innovation will focus on compensating for this bottleneck An obvious solu tion is to design intelligent machines to attend to the choices and tasks that do not have to be done by humans For example there are already intelli gent agent programs to sort email discarding unwanted messages and pri 0ritizing the rest The programs work along lines similar to neural nets They tabulate the choices the human operators make and they feed back this information in recursive loops to readjust the weights given to various kinds of email addresses After an initial learning period the sorting pro grams take over more and more of the email management freeing humans to give their attention to other matters If we extrapolate from these relatively simple programs to an environ ment that as Charles Ostman likes to put it supplies synthetic sentience on demand human consciousness would ride on top of a highly articulated and complex computational ecology in which many decisions invisible to human attention would be made by intelligent machines15 Over two decades ago Joseph Veizenhaum foresaw just such an ecology and pas sionately argued that judgment is a uniquely human function and must not be turned over to computers Hi With the rapid development of neural nets and expert programs it is no longer so clear that sophisticated judgments cannot be made by machines and in some instances made more accurately than by humans But the issue in vVeizenbaums view involves more 288  Chapter Eleven than whether or not the programs work Rather the issue is an ethical im perative that humans keep control to do otherwise is to abdicate their re sponsibilities as autonomous independent beings What Weizenbaums argument makes clear is the connection between the assumptions under girding the liberal humanist subject and the ethical position that humans not machines must be in control Such an argument assumes a vision of the human in which conscious agency is the essence of human identity Sacri fice this and we humans are hopelessly compromised contaminated with mechanic alienness in the very heart of our humanityI7 Hence there is an urgency even panic in Weizenbaums insistence that judgment is a uniquely human function At stake for him is nothing less than what it means to be human In the posthuman view by contrast conscious agency has never been in control In fact the very illusion of control bespeaks a fundamental igno rance about the nature of the emergent processes through which con sciousness the organism and the environment are constituted Mastery through the exercise of autonomous will is merely the story consciousness tells itself to explain results that actually come about through chaotic dy namics and emergent structures If as Donna Haraway Sandra Harding Evelyn Fox Keller Carolyn Merchant and other feminist critics of science have argued there is a relation among the desire for mastery an objectivist account of science and the imperialist project of subdUing nature then the posthuman offers resources for the construction of another kind of ac count I8 In this account emergence replaces teleology reflexive episte mology replaces objectivism distributed cognition replaces autonomous will embodiment replaces a body seen as a support system for the mind and a dynamic partnership between humans and intelligent machines re places the liberal humanist subjects manifest destiny to dominate and con trol nature Of course this is not necessarily what the posthuman will meanonly what it can mean if certain strands among its complex seri ations are highlighted and combined to create a vision of the human that uses the posthuman as leverage to avoid reinscribing and thus repeating some ofthe mistakes of the past Just as the posthuman need not be antihuman so it also need not be apocalyptic Edwin Hutchins addresses the idea of distributed cognition through his nuanced study of the navigational systems of oceangoing shipsI9 His meticulous research shows that the cognitive system responsi ble for locating the ship in space and navigating it successfully resides not in humans alone but in the complex interactions within an environment that includes both human and nonhuman actors His study allows him to give an Conclusion  excellent response to John Searles famous Chinese room By imagining a situation in which communication in Chinese can take place without the actors knowing what their actions mean Searle challenged the idea that machines can think 20 Suppose Searle said that he is stuck inside a room he who knows not a word of Chinese Texts written in Chinese are slid through a slot in the door He has in the room with him baskets of Chinese characters and a rule book correlating the symbols written on the texts with other symbols in the basket Using the rulebook he assembles strings of characters and pushes them out the door Although his Chinese interlocu tors take these strings to be clever responses to their inquiries Searle has not the least idea of the meaning of the texts he has produced Therefore it would be a mistake to say that machines can think he argues for like him they produce comprehensible results without comprehending anything themselves In Hutchinss neat interpretation Searles argument is valu able precisely because it makes clear that it is not Searle but the entire room that knows Chinese21 In this distributed cognitive system the Chinese room knows more than do any of its components including Searle The sit uation of modem humans is akin to that of Searle in the Chinese room for every day we participate in systems whose total cognitive capacity exceeds our individual knowledge including such devices as cars with electronic ignition systems microwaves with computer chips that preCisely adjust power levels fax machines that warble to other fax machines and electro nic watches that communicate with a timing radio wave to set themselves and correct their date Modem humans are capable of more sophisticated cognition than cavemen not because modems are smarter Hutchins con cludes but because they have constructed smarter environments in which to work Hutchins would no doubt disagree with Weizenbaums view that judgment should be reserved for humans alone Like cognition decision making is distributed between human and nonhuman agents from the steampowered steering system that suddenly failed on a navy vessel Hutchins was studying to the charts and pocket calculators that the naviga tors were then forced to use to calculate their position He convincingly shows that these adaptations to changed circumstances were evolutionary and embodied rather than abstract and conSCiously deSigned pp 34751 The solution to the problem caused by this sudden failure of the steering mechanism was clearly discovered by the organization of the system as a whole before it was discovered by any of the participants p 361 Seen in this perspective the prospect of humans working in partnership with intel ligent machines is not so much a usurpation of human right and responsi 290  Chapter Eleven bility as it is a further development in the construction of distributed cogni tion environments a construction that has been ongoing for thousands of years Also changed in this perspective is the relation of human subjectivity to its environment No longer is human will seen as the source from which emanates the mastery necessary to dominate and control the environment Rather the distributed cognition of the emergent human subject corre lates within Batesons phrase becomes a metaphor forthe distributed cognitive system as a whole in which thinking is done by both human and nonhuman actors Thinking consists of bringing these structures into co ordination so they can shape and be shaped by one another Hutchins wrote p 316 To conceptualize the human in these terms is not to imperil human survival but is precisely to enhance it for the more we understand the flexible adaptive structures that coordinate our environments and the metaphors that we ourselves are the better we can fashion images of our selves that accurately reflect the complex interplays that ultimately make the entire world one system This view of the posthuman also offers resources for thinking in more so phisticated ways about virtual technologies As long as the human subject is envisioned as an autonomous self with unambiguous boundaries the hu mancomputer interface can only be parsed as a division between the so lidity of real life on one side and the illusion of virtual reality on the other thus obscuring the farreaching changes initiated by the development of virtual technologies Only if one thinks of the subject as an autonomous self independent of the environment is one likely to experience the panic per formed by Norbert Wieners Cybernetics and Bernard Wolfes Limbo This view of the self authorizes the fear that if the boundaries are breached at all there will be nothing to stop the selfs complete dissolution By contrast when the human is seen as part of a distributed system the full expression of human capability can be seen precisely to depend on the splice rather than being imperiled by it Writing in another context Hutchins arrives at an inSight profoundly applicable to virtual technolOgies What used to look like internalization of thought and subjectivity now appears as a gradual propagation of organized functional properties across a set of malleable media p 312 This vision is a potent antidote to the view that parses vir tuality as a division between an inert body that is left behind and a dis embodied subjectivity that inhabits a virtual realm the construction of virtuality performed by Case in William Gibsons Neuromancer when he delights in the bodiless exultation of cyberspace and fears above all dropping back into the meat of the body22 By contrast in the model that Hutchins presents and that the posthuman helps to authorize human Conclusion I functionality expands because the parameters of the cognitive system it in habits expand In this model it is not a question ofleaving the body behind but rather of extending embodied awareness in highly specific local and material ways that would be impossible without electronic prosthesis As we have seen cybernetics was born in a froth of noise when Norbert Wiener first thought of it as a way to maximize human potential in a world that is in essence chaotic and unpredictable Like many other pioneers Wiener helped to initiate a journey that would prove to have consequences more farreaching and subversive than even his formidable powers of imagination could conceive As Bateson Varela and others would later ar gue the noise crashes within as well as without The chaotic unpredictable nature of complex dynamics implies that subjectivity is emergent rather than given distributed rather than located solely in consciousness emerg ing from and integrated into a chaotic world rather than occupying a posi tion of mastery and control removed from it Bruno Latour has argued that we have never

posthuman23 The purpose of this book has been to chronicle the journeys that have made this realization pOSSible If the three stories told herehow information lost its body how the cyborg was constructed in the postwar years as technological artifact and cultural icon and how the human be came the posthumanhave at times seemed to present the posthuman as a transformation to be feared and abhorred rather than welcomed and em braced that reaction has everything to do with how the posthuman is con structed and understood The best possible time to contest for what the posthuman means is now before the trains of thought it embodies have been laid down so firmly that it would take dynamite to change them24 Al though some current versions of the posthuman point toward the anti human and the apocalyptic we can craft others that will be conducive to the longrange survival of humans and of the other lifeforms biological and artificial with whom we share the planet and ourselves Not e s

Sheep and Nine Lives Abstract This essay explores the contention that posthuman subjects such as androids clones and robots can experience psychological trauma The aim of the paper is to examine this notion in three science fiction texts Mary Shelleys Frankenstein Philip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Ursula K Le Guins short story Nine Lives What these narratives illustrate is that trauma manifestations can contribute to a disruption of ontological frameworks that maintain categories such as human and nonhuman as permanent and distinct As a result it might be argued that these texts undermine anthropocentrism and invite a reconceptualising around the term human but also around trauma conventionally understood as a primarily human experience Science fiction is thereby a signif icant genre when it comes to questioning anthropocentric perspectives Using posthuman theory and trauma studies this essay argues that these three texts portray their respective posthuman subjects as trauma victims and further that they demonstrate how the experience of trauma carries with it the potential to bridge the gap between human and posthuman through the act of bearing witness to one anothers trauma Keywords Science fiction trauma studies posthumanism Frankenstein Philip K Dick Ursula K Le Guin Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Electric Sheep Science Fiction Portrayals Introduction The term Anthropocene was popularised by Nobelwinning chemist Paul Crutzen around the turn of the millennium denoting what many scholars now consider the ap propriate name for our current geological epoch What defines the Anthropocene is how human activity has altered Earths climate and atmosphere to the extent that human kind must consider itself a direct geophysical force and an incontrovertible influence on the environment Crutzen 2002 23 If this is indeed the case the discovery of the Anthropocene should serve as the impetus to abandon the notion of human excep tionalism Humanities research literary studies included is required to take this into account Among the currently expanding fields within the study of literature is trau ma studies committed to exploring literary representations of psychological trauma Considering the implications of the Anthropocene however one might argue that the fields focus is highly anthropocentric This is perhaps not surprisingly also the case for most psychoanalytic criticism as we tend to think of the mind the unconscious and emotional intelligence as something uniquely and definingly human How can a robot for instance be capable of repressing traumatic memories This is hardly something we can imagine in todays technologies despite the rapid development of computers that are becoming increasingly mindlike However these are scenarios that science fiction texts have already been exploring for decades Scholars should therefore discard what Roger Luckhurst 2014 has described as a high cultural suspicion of SF which per haps has prevented science fiction texts from being fully explored in the past 5 and should devote more attention to the issues that scifi has raised and to how the genre can contribute to dissolving the foundations of anthropocentric perspectives A small amount of research has already examined the notion of posthuman trauma to a certain extent In his article Posthuman Wounds 2014 Tony M Vinci argues that the human characters of Philip K Dicks novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep 1968 practice a form of trauma deferment by using androids and animals as scapegoats and thus uphold an ontological framework that promotes human excep tionalism 93 Vinci also briefly speculates about the androids potential to experience trauma themselves what would it mean if the android could indeed be possessed by the traumatic event while also fully inhabiting the traumatic moment In other words what if the android were not only witnessing human events but experiencing its own trauma as well 2014 97 This is an intriguing question and one which will serve as the main focus of this essay Whereas Vincis article is primarily interested in human trauma this essay seeks to elaborate on posthuman trauma by examining various scifi narratives that feature traumatised posthuman subjects and to draw attention to the dif ferent ways in which these traumas manifest The essay aims to consider the Creature from Mary Shelleys Frankenstein 1818 the androids featured in Philip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Kaph the clone from Ursula K Le Guins short story Nine Lives 1969 By synthesising trauma studies with theories loosely centred around posthumanism the essay will show that the abovementioned texts Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Ida Marie Olsen New Horizons in English Studies  32018 suggest that manufactured posthuman subjects are indeed able to experience trauma in different manners and that this contributes to a blurring of the boundaries between ma chines and humans thus undermining anthropocentrism Further one might argue that the texts also illustrate how trauma in the posthuman subject provides opportunities for humans to bear witness to the Others suffering and hence the experience of trauma establishes a platform for encounters where the humans fear of the posthuman Other transforms into understanding and compassion This is also the outcome when both human and posthuman are victims of trauma and are able to connect in their mutual experience as some of the texts show Trauma and Technology In the past trauma studies have been concerned with topics such as political conflict war violence terror and the Holocaust With regard to the relationship between trauma and technology one might argue that the latter has indirectly been regarded as contrib uting to psychological trauma although there is much potential in focusing more closely on the role of technology in trauma studies Indeed Roger Luckhurst 2005 has advo cated the necessity for more research incorporating science fiction texts into the field 5 Luckhurst in his tracing of the cultural history of science fiction asserts how technology has conventionally been regarded as a cause of psychological trauma 2005 27 Walter Benjamin for instance famously paints a picture of the modern urban experience where crowds cameras films and traffic cause the individual to experience a series of shocks and collisions Benjamin 2006 27 Modern technology has therefore been seen as in herently traumatic for the human individual and has been understood to cause trauma This is perhaps also apparent in Freuds famous railway accident example where he illustrates how accidents may lead to symptoms of trauma what causes the traumatis ing accident is the technology of the railway It may be suggested however that the development of technology has come so far that it might be time to reverse our thinking about the traumatechnology relationship An idea that may be considered is that instead of technology causing human trauma we are now the ones who traumatise technology What if technology in the form of computers and robots has evolved to the point where it possesses the ability to become traumatised This trajectory of thought is one that ought to be considered in an attempt to debunk anthropocentrism and to investigate and broaden the categories of trauma human and posthuman Upon closer inspection these scenarios are not as bizarre as they sound because the fact is that mindlike computers are already in the process of construction Robots and computers are now functioning with such complexity and sophistication that they are close to replicating human characteristics and abilities In his overview of the possibil ities of cognitive computing and cognitive systems Ahmed K Noor 2015 explains that these new computer

therefore potentially be replicated Noor 2015 76 The notion of technological adaptation of human abilities and mental properties has however been introduced decades earlier as illustrated by for instance the anthology Android Epistemology 1995 edited by Kenneth M Ford Clark N Glymour and Patrick J Hayes The anthology contains Herbert A Simons article Machine as Mind which presents the thesis that the acquisition of a mind is achievable for computers because the human brain is replicable the materials of thoughts are symbols  patterns which can be replicated in a great variety of materials including neurons and chips 1995 25 Simon further criticises sceptics of this idea for having a romanticised understanding of the human mind 1995 38 Both Simons and Noors work then demonstrate that posthuman intelligence is not located in the realm of distant future and that todays advancements in cognitive computers under score the necessity of reflection around these issues If computational machines are becoming intelligent and capable of storing memories then our notion of the psyche needs to be altered to include posthuman subjectivity As Noor points out trauma in computers robots and androids may soon become an actuality and we should there fore dismiss the thought of trauma as a uniquely human experience This is where literature and especially science fiction can provide valuable knowl edge Luckhurst 2014 has argued that the study of science fiction within a trauma stud ies framework can lead to significant insights into the trauma concept because the gen re dismantles any recognizable human subject in challenging ways  as imagined futures outgrow the psychodynamic frameworks that dominate conceptions of cultural trauma 159 However Luckhurst does not elaborate on how this expanded trauma theory where one incorporates posthuman subjectivity would be configured He points to texts such as Greg Egans Reasons to be Cheerful 1999 and Charles Stross novel Accelerando 2005 where subjectivity has been completely altered through capacities for simulation and direct neurological interference and Luckhurst argues that these vi sions challenge us to address the rapid development of new scientific understandings that are likely to reconceptualise notions of trauma in the very near future 2014 166 Although as Luckhurst states there is a necessity to reconceptualise trauma one might still argue that traditional trauma theory can serve as a beneficial angle from which to consider the posthuman subject as many of the discussions provided by for instance Freud and Cathy Caruth are still highly relevant in an encounter with science fiction Drawing on psychoanalysis poststructuralism and psychology literary trauma theory developed in the later decades of the twentieth century especially following the introduction of the PTSD diagnosis The field draws major inspiration from Freud one of the first philosophers to discuss trauma although he revised his opinion about the nature of the concept several times In Beyond the Pleasure Principle 1920 and Moses and Monotheism 1939 Freud debates symptoms such as the nightmares of Pobrane z czasopisma New

Caruth 1996 who is one of the leading trauma theorists today interprets Freuds definition of trauma as an event that  is experienced too soon too unexpectedly to be fully known and is therefore not available to consciousness until it imposes itself again repeatedly in the nightmares and repetitive actions of the survivor 4 Discussing the trauma of accidents Caruth argues that the accident does not simply represent the violence of a collision but also conveys the impact of its very incomprehensibility What returns to haunt the victim  is not only the reality of the violent event but also the reality of the way that its violence has not yet been fully known 1996 6 Trauma therefore revolves mainly around the individuals inability to comprehend or process the traumatising event This might have some interesting implications in light of artificial intelligence which like the human mind would be engaged in an act of processing Michelle Balaev 2008 similarly interprets trauma as becoming unrepresentable due to the inability of the brain understood as the carrier of coherent cognitive schemata to properly encode and process the event 151 The terminology here therefore suggests some evident links between the trauma experience and ma chine intelligence Typical symptoms of trauma have been listed by Luckhurst 2008 drawing on the official diagnostic manual from the American Psychiatric Association and include flashbacks nightmares avoidance of thoughts and feelings loss of temper control and hypervigilance 1 These are symptoms that we can identity in the post human trauma victims depicted in the texts this essay will be examining Monstrous Wounds Primal Trauma and Parental Rejection in Frankenstein Several critics have noted that Mary Shelleys Frankenstein may have been a manifes tation of the authors own traumatic experiences Mark A Rubenstein 1976 empha sises how the novel was influenced by Shelleys loss of her mother as well as the death of Shelleys child shortly after his birth These are aspects of trauma related to parent hood family and birth  significant themes that can contribute to an understanding of the traumas located in the novel In the backdrop of the novels horror trauma does indeed play a significant part Examining the Creatures psyche in light of trauma will reveal how the novel portrays a posthuman form of trauma while also advocating the need for this trauma to be acknowledged The majority of psychoanalytic readings such as Rubensteins and Sherwins 1981 have been devoted to examining Victors psyche when in reality the Creatures psyche is equally important for understanding the novel The Creature in Frankenstein has typically been attributed to the role of perpetrator murderer and antagonist and hence he is also known as the Monster Yet by allowing the Creature to express his grief and by giving voice to his version Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Electric Sheep Science Fiction Portrayals of the story the novel clearly invites sympathy for the Creature and implies that his monstrosity derives from Victors failure in his role as a parent The novel thus urges the reader to consider the Creature more as a victim rather than as perpetrator and considering Victors side of the story presents these categories as fluid and unstable There are several hints in the novel that the Creature does experience trauma and is capable of emotional reactions As we learn from Victors account the Creature is made from organic materials both human and animal and is somehow brought to life by Victor trying to infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing Shelley 2017 41 We can therefore assume that the Creature is humanoid though not entirely human The narrative reveals that he has highly developed cognitive abilities and that he ex periences strong emotions This becomes particularly evident in the novels ending scene where the Creature talks about his wounds Shelley 2017 87 which is the translation of the word trauma in Greek He appears traumatised speaking of his burning miseries and the agonies which consume him Shelley 2017 18687 If not directly showing symptoms of trauma the Creature certainly experiences strong emotions generated by the memories he has stored It might also be suggested that the Creature exhibits more empathy and emotions than humans in many instance as illustrated for example by his vegetarian diet my food is not that of man I do not de stroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment Shelley 2017 121 The Creature also experiences empathy towards other people through for instance his ability to observe the daily lives of the De Lacey family listen to their stories recognise their emotions and assist them As will also be the case with Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep empathy is one of the main symptoms of being human in Dicks novel The main source of the Creatures trauma one might argue is in fact his own birth  a traumatising experience that is reinforced by Victors immediate rejection Interest ingly this is reminiscent of what many psychoanalysts for instance Freud and Wilfred Bion theorise about birth in itself as a traumatic occurrence for the infant Whereas Freud explains primal trauma in terms of how the infant loses connection with the mother Wilfred Bion sees it as an inevitable part of birth because a baby is born with very limited ability to process its perinatal sense of impressions which it will inevita bly find overwhelming Crago 2016 12 Bions picture of primal trauma seems very similar to what the Creature experiences during the early moments of his life when he describes his first memories as confused and indistinct Shelley 2017 83 Further more he states a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me and I saw felt heard and smelt at the same time as if he cannot process what is happening Shelley 2017 83 The birth of the Creature is made increasingly traumatic by Victors abandonment of his creation and thus he prevents any form of contact or communication between the two from taking place Shortly after Victor has fled the scene of the birth the Creature comes into Victors bedroom obviously seeking contact with one hand  stretched out and muttering some inarticulate sounds Shelley 2017 4243 The Creature is therefore portrayed like a newborn overwhelmed by sense impressions Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Ida Marie Olsen New Horizons in English Studies  32018 The circumstances of the Creatures birth become the recurring trauma that continues to haunt him throughout the story as he struggles to comprehend Victors rejection am I not alone miserably alone You my creator abhor me Shelley 2017 81 Paul Sherwin has similarly discussed the Creatures experience of rejection and exclusion as catastrophic asserting that the Creatures utmost desire is that another reciprocate his need for sympathetic relationship and even after he becomes searingly conscious of his exclusion from the human community and be gins to objectify the negativity he arouses in others we recognize that his aggression is a byprod uct of disintegration not an innate drive that has been cathartically unbound 1981 890 The Creatures experience of his own exclusion therefore leads him to kill his vic tims It is evident that his aggressive actions can be traced back to his trauma Both Victor Frankenstein and Walton become witnesses to the Creatures trauma However they always seem to be in disbelief refusing to acknowledge it fully and to accept the Creatures humanity As will be shown at the end of this essay the act of bearing witness to anothers trauma is of major importance in Le Guins short story as the text demonstrates that human recognition of the posthumans ability to become traumatised can lead to successful encounters between human and humanoid In Frank enstein both Victor and Walton fail at this recognition Walton admits to feeling empathy for the Creature at first seeing him and hearing his side of the story when the two meet following Victors death I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery Walton states after having observed the Creature with a mixture of curiosity and compassion Shelley 2017 18485 But when Walton recalls Victors version of the tale his em phatic response changes into rage and indignation Shelley 2017 185 What Walton does not comprehend is that the Creature clearly suffers from some form of trauma and is desperate for the humans to acknowledge this However the humans narrow view of the psyche and their belief in human exceptionalism is too strong for this to happen and as a result the story becomes a tragedy for both Victor and the Creature a human and a posthuman Frankenstein thus becomes an important example of how much damage artificial intelligence can do if humans do not acknowledge the full extent of their exist ence their inner lives and their potential to store memories experiences and process these episodes In this way the novel makes a significant contribution to posthumanism particularly as it sheds light on the posthuman subjects ability to become traumatised Android Suffering Trauma as Catalyst for NonAnthropocentric Ontologies in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Philip K Dicks novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is concerned with the boundaries between human and posthuman perhaps to an even greater extent than Frankenstein In its attention to these borders trauma becomes a significant motif The Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Electric Sheep Science Fiction Portrayals novel depicts a postapocalyptic world where the majority of the human population has emigrated to Mars Humanoid androids have been created first as a form of wartechnol ogy socalled freedom fighters but now functioning as servants for humans who emi grate The job of protagonist Rick Deckard is to retire those androids who have escaped to Earth where their presence is illegal This is something he accomplishes through performing an empathy test on the androids as the only way to distinguish them from humans is to prove their alleged inability to empathise As the narrative progresses this distinction between human and android gradually falters Commenting on Dicks fiction in general Roger Luckhurst 2005 states that the protagonists find their locations in time and space subject to a bewildering disorder as the fabric of reality distends reveal ing a jerrybuilt artifice on the verge of collapse 107 Not only is this bewildering dis order a major ontological trauma for the human characters in Do Androids Dream but this is also the case for the androids In the universe of the novel humans are considered real and superior to the artificial androids in the same manner as real animals are seen as superior to electric ones As a result the androids are consistently confronted with so cial conventions which assert their artificiality as the characters we know to be androids continue to be reminded that they are not human even though everything that happens in the narrative suggests that the humanandroid dichotomy is false Furthermore as Tony Vinci points out if android trauma is considered a valid narrative of pain it will threaten to revise the distinction between real and artificial 2014 95 Since the novel indicates that android trauma is real this is one of the main ways in which Dick initiates a broad ening of the human concept and introduces posthuman trauma as a valid experience The novel demonstrates this posthuman trauma in several ways The most significant scene of android traumatisation is when Rachael a Nexus6 type android discovers Deckards plans to retire Pris an android who shares her physical features Rachael is clearly upset and distracted by Deckards revelation she had turned pale and her voice shook All at once she had become exceptionally unsteady Dick 1999 159 The scene demonstrates how Rachael feels empathy for Pris and possibly for the other androids as well something she confirms when Deckard suggests that she feels empathy Dick 1999 161 In spite of the fact that Rachael may simply be simulating her empathetic response the novel later implies that Rachael also has feelings and empathy for Deckard Indeed N Katherine Hayless interpretation of Rachaels character is that Rachaels strategy implies that she feels empathy for her fellow androids giving lie to the governments position that androids feel no loyalty to each other If she can care for her fel low androids we may wonder if she also cares for Deckard as she claims when she tells him that she loves him 173 In a manner highly reminiscent of the Creatures murders in Frankenstein Rachael proceeds to murder Deckards goat after he has ventured to retire the remaining an droids Rachaels unpredictable behaviour it may be suggested is symptomatic of her trauma Rachael is traumatised by Deckards ultimate belief in her artificiality which he Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Ida Marie Olsen New Horizons in English Studies  32018 particularly demonstrates in how abruptly he decides to kill her but changes his mind again Another contributing cause for Rachaels trauma could of course also be Deck ards retirement of her fellow androids which again underscores Rachaels empathy Regardless of Rachaels motives the act of murdering Deckards goat demonstrates Ra chaels posthuman trauma thereby both undermining the ontological framework that the Do Androids Dream society rests on and confirming the actuality of posthuman trauma The Strangeness of the Stranger Encountering the Other Through Trauma in Nine Lives Ursula K Le Guins short story Nine Lives depicts two humans stationed to work on a uranium mining project on the atmospherically hostile planet Libra As the story begins the men Pugh and Martin are joined by a crew of superhuman clones who ap pear to share an exceptionally close bond The expedition transforms into a traumatic experience for one of the clones Kaph when his nine siblings die in the impact of an earthquake What is interesting about this story is the trauma that Kaph clearly suffers from following this event It is evident that the episode manifests as a completely post human form of trauma because of the close connections that the clones share What is significant too is the way in which this posthuman trauma leads to an encounter and a mutual understanding between human and humanoid Le Guins story therefore highlights the importance of trauma as a mutual experience platform for a successful humanhumanoid confrontation and demonstrates that trauma can contribute to break ing down human perceptions of distinct boundaries between human and posthuman much like in Dicks novel This theme is also emphasised by Le Guins choice of set ting the stage where the trauma unfolds is itself portrayed as a traumatised place The opening of the narrative describes the planet Libra in the following manner she was alive inside but dead outside  Underneath in the black corridors the halls beneath the skin there were crepitations in darkness ferments chemical nightmares that went on for centuries Le Guin 2010 453 my italics This resonates with typical trauma symptoms such as nightmares and one wonders whether Le Guin intentionally draws on trauma as a theme in this story Like the Creature in Frankenstein and Rachael in Do Android Dream Kaph is traumatised His trauma arises from a distinct event the loss of his siblings in the un expected event of an earthquake This form of trauma which stems from a sudden and incomprehensible incident seems to correspond to Freuds understanding of accident trauma As previously mentioned Freud imagines a person surviving a train accident unharmed but with symptoms of trauma manifesting in the weeks after the accident He develops a series of grave physical and motor symptoms which one can ascribe only to his shock or whatever else happened at the time of the accident He has devel oped traumatic neurosis Freud writes 1939 119 Similarly Kaph is in shock but physically unharmed when Pugh and Martin discover him at the site of the earthquake Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Electric Sheep Science Fiction Portrayals He experiences seizures and choking for a long period of time after the accident and when the seizures finally subside he appears apathetic silent and staring into a dark ness that was not there Le Guin 2010 468 Pugh and Martin speculate on whether Kaph is experiencing the deaths of the nine other clones They were all of him he is all of them They died and now hes dying their deaths one by one they state Le Guin 2010 467 The full extent of Kaphs trauma begins to dawn on Pugh and Martin as they continue to observe him Additionally what is noticeable about the two men is that they are afraid of Kaph believing him to be unpredictable and capable of killing them This eerie situation echoes the uncanniness at the beginning of the story when the humans meet the clones for the first time Pugh and Martin are uncertain of what to make of the ten superhumans and their scepticism towards them strengthens the distinct categories of natural human and clone Kaphs unprocessed trauma like the Creatures trauma in Shelleys novel therefore poses a threat to the humans or at least this is what the humans believe and the story hints at the fact that the posthumans ability to experience trauma should be acknowledged and dealt with by humans What happens at the end of the short story however changes the mens rigid per ceptions of the human category and they become more attuned to and at ease with the posthuman This transformation takes place through Kaph and the men witnessing each others trauma Towards the close of the narrative both Pugh and Martin expe rience traumas of their own as Martin is caught in the centre of an earthquake and Pugh sets out to rescue him The situation causes Kaph to comprehend the two mens affection for one another The subsequent talk between Pugh and Kaph which serves as the storys ending scene clearly alters the situation for Kaph his face was changed as if he were glimpsing something he had not seen before his voice too was changed Le Guin 2010 475 What Kaph now sees is Owen Pugh the thing he had never seen before  the stranger who held his hand out in the dark Le Guin 2010 476 This scene can serve as an instance of how trauma can lead to an understanding with regard to the Other This is something Cathy Caruth also emphasises in Unclaimed Experi ence 1996 where she argues that ones own trauma is tied up with the trauma of another and that trauma may lead therefore to the encounter with another through the very possibility and surprise of listening to anothers wound 8 This one might argue is exactly what Nine Lives wishes to convey The strangeness of the stranger Le Guin 2010 455 particularly in a posthuman context becomes less strange when it is recognised that both human and posthuman may suffer from trauma and that this carries with it the potential for encounters and mutual understandings Conclusion To conclude the science fiction genre is invaluable in helping us abandon the an thropocentric worldview that has contributed to the advent of the Anthropocene As shown here one way that scifi texts achieve this is by illustrating that trauma is not Pobrane z czasopisma New Horizons in English Studies httpnewhorizonsumcspl Data 30012025 162039 Ida Marie Olsen New Horizons in English Studies  32018 a uniquely human experience but is also potentially experienceable by posthumans such as humanoid creatures androids and clones Mary Shelleys novel highlights the importance of human perceptibility to the needs and symptoms of a traumatized posthuman creation in order to prevent destructive behaviour from taking place Do Androids Dream also demonstrates how androids have the potential to become trauma victims although humans do not allow them to This in itself is traumatic for the an droids and in Rachaels character we clearly observe symptoms of humanlike trauma Finally Nine Lives is an example of how trauma can lead to reconciliation between human and posthuman or human and Other as theorized by Cathy Caruth Through shared trauma a successful encounter between Pugh Martin and Kaph ensues and the strangeness of the Other becomes familiarised and safe What these narratives have in common is their undermining of the rigid boundaries between human and nonhu man through the use of trauma as motif Ultimately all

    ns1:text "Electric Sheep W HAT MAKES US HUMAN IS A QUESTION OFTEN RAISED IN and by science ﬁction and the postWorldWarTer minus postapocalyptic society of 2021 that protag onist Rick Deckard inhabits in P K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep seems both to raise and to answer it in espousing two speciﬁcyet ultimately mutually contradictorydeﬁnitions of human Numerous details of the novels setting and characteriza tions reveal that this societys very obsession with deﬁning human is undertaken in bad faith and consequently that its accepted legal istic ofﬁcial deﬁnitionsas their incompatibility suggestsare both false Yet the question thus raised through the ploy of explicitly pro viding highly suspect answers to it is legitimately addressed by the novels plot by the action and this more convincing but philosophi cally more challenging deﬁnition of human that arises implicitly from the story itself is instrumental to establishing the novels theme cisco Police Department and his society deﬁnes human primarily through the distinction it insists upon drawing between humans and the androids that are Deckards prey To be human is to possess empathy Even Garland an android masquerading as the senior ofﬁcial in a phony police department organized by the androids for their own protection acknowledges that we lack a speciﬁc talent you humans possess empathy a deﬁciency that Deckard later refers to as a deliberately builtin defect 99 108 162 Thus The Journal of Popular Culture Vol 46 No 6 2013  2014 Wiley Periodicals Inc VoigtKampff empathymeasuring test 26 And just as it is ironic and telling that humans in this society most commonly experience empathy through a machine the empathy box and use yet another machine the mood organ to avoid despair about total reality it is similarly ironic that Deckard gauges empathy by machine his testing apparatus moreover the test questions which elicit a physiological reaction to a number of social situa tions clearly reveal that the test really measures only a socially engendered culturespeciﬁc aversion to killing or harming animals this societys primary taboo rather than any truly universal innate and exclusiveand therefore deﬁnitivehuman quality 3 42 Human subjects are expected to exhibit a quantiﬁable shock or shame reaction to stimuli that would not in all but one or two instances elicit any such reaction from ordinary people in the real world or speciﬁcally from Dicks American contemporaries in 1968 mention of a calfskin wallet a butterﬂy collection including killing jar a bearskin rug boiled lobster a mounted deers head an abortion bullﬁght posters and eating raw oysters or boiled dog 4245 Elden Rosen claims that Rachel who is posing as a human scored as an android might on the test because she had spent most of her life on an failed space mission to Proxima Centauri and learned about Earth only from the ships tape library and what the nine other crew members knew that Deckard ﬁnds this false assertion plausible indicates in itself that his test measures a socially acquired response to stimuli not an innate human characteristic 46 Also after emphasizing that a valid deﬁnition must be exclusive in musing that empathy evidently existed only within the human community Deckard immediately invalidates this societal deﬁni tion concedes that empathy is not exclusively a human trait in speculating that empathy must be limited to herbivores or anyhow omnivores who could depart from a meat diet Because ulti mately the empathic gift blurred the boundaries between hunter and victim A herd animal such as man would acquire a higher survival factor through this because members of the herd would aid one another due to their mutual empathy but a solitary predator like an owl or a cobra would be destroyed 2627 This is a poor deﬁnition not only because it is not exclusive in that nonhuman herd animals such as dogs may exhibit empathy as well but also Faith and Bad Faith

worked alone in hunting androids 27 76 This irony is reinforced by John Isidores indis tinct impression of a bounty hunter as a machinelike thing without emotions that if killed got replaced immediately by another resembling it for this is a moreaccurate description of an android and is speciﬁcally like Isidores coetaneous momentary per ception of the android Roy Baty as a frame of metal a platform of pullies and circuits and batteries and turrets and gears 139 Moreover Deckard cannot empathize with his wife Irans desire for a moodorgan induced sixhour selfaccusatory depression which only makes him feel bitterly that she has nothing to give me 8283 Iran towards those who cannot afford one most people look down on you for not taking care of an animal they consider it immoral and antiempathic 10 People in general also look down on rather than empathize with specials those like Isidore who cannot pass the minimum mental faculties test because exposure to the omni present radioactive dust has degraded their intelligence and genetic integrity Like an android once pegged as special a citizen ceased in effect to be part of mankind and the governmentspon sored TV channel constantly informs Isidore in a countless proces sion of ways that he a special wasnt wanted that upon him the contempt of three planets descended 13 17 15 His boss Hanni bal Sloat calls Isidore a chickenhead a derogatory term for a less deteriorated special and cruelly forces him to make a telephone call that he is terriﬁed to make 69 Ironically echoing this human preju dice even the android he tries to befriend Pris sneers at chicken heads and at the suggestion that she live with a chickenhead Isidore even as her fellow android Irmgard Baty realizes intellectu ally that Isidore can empathize with androids precisely because humans dont treat him very well either 59 137 144 As those who cannot pass the minimum mental faculties test ceased in effect to be part of mankind this society likewise deﬁnes human secondarily through the distinction it also insists upon drawing between humans and specials To be human is to possess a minimum IQ Yet this deﬁnition too lacks the necessary quality of exclusivity because ironically the very androids Deckard is hunt ing the Nexus6 android types surpassed several classes of human specials in terms of intelligence no intelligence test would trap such an andy But then intelligence tests hadnt trapped an andy in years 2526 And Isidore while lacking the minimum IQ is the most empathicand for this reason also the most sympathetic and apparently humancharacter in the novel While the synthetic sufferings of false animals didnt bother Milt Borogrove or their boss Hannibal Sloat Isidore feels such empathy for the dying cat he transports to Sloats animal repair shop even though he believes it is not alive but electrical that what he thinks is merely the faked sound of a false animal burning out its drivetrain and power supply ties his stomach in knots 64 Isidore not only empathizes with the androids as well but is also terribly upset and then violently hysterical because Pris later cuts the legs off a spider he had

obviously human to the reader suggests that this societys secondary deﬁnition of human is false per se this in itself calls into question any other deﬁnition of humanity it might espouse including its primary deﬁnition And both deﬁnitions of human are called into question simultaneously in any case because they contradict one another in the person of Isi dore who exhibits more empathy the primary deﬁnition than any other character in the novel and yet cannot exhibit minimum mental faculties the secondary deﬁnition A close reading reveals not only that both deﬁnitions are false but also that both are similarly assumed in bad faiththrough this societys willful selfdeceptionprecisely to allow its members to claim as exclusively theirs those very qualities empathy and intelli gence that the historical fact of WWT demonstrates humanity does not possess in sufﬁcient abundance That is this society makes both specials and androids its scapegoats much as the dominant members of many real societies employ racism to make scapegoats of desig nated minorities via bad faith in order to deﬁne themselves as possessing only those positive traits they want to believe they embody through attributing exclusively to members of the desig nated outgroup to which they contrast themselves those opposite negative personality traits they want to deny the possibility of having in themselves And the analogy to this function of racism in real societies is explicitly suggested by the propaganda that Deckards societys government disseminates to motivate its citizens to emigrate to the offworld colonies To complement the radioactive fallout as stick the ultimate incentive of emigration is possession of an android servant as carrot and the promise that this social arrange ment duplicates the halcyon days of the preCivil War Southern states Either as body servants or tireless ﬁeld hands the customtai lored humanoid robot will be the emigrants loyal troublefree companion 1314

the VoigtKampff test measures while Pris attempts to conceal from Isidore that she is an android to explain away her lack of empathy by claiming to have escaped from a mental hospital Were all

of them must of necessity triumph and the other be destroyed His task therefore is purely negative there is no question of building a society but only of purifying the one that exists it is only a matter of getting rid of Evil the antisemite has decided about evil so as not to have to decide about the good It is not his fault if his mission is to destroy evil with evil The Jew is only a pretext

am notBad faith is a lie to oneself The essence of the lie implies that the liar is actually in complete possession of the truth which he is hiding In bad faith it is from myself that I am hiding the truth which means that I must know in my capacity as deceiver the truth which is hidden from me in my capacity as the one deceived Better yet I must know the truth very exactly in order to conceal it

which brought him daily so long as he failed to emigrate its little load of befouling ﬁlth the fact that like Deckard persons here and there declined to migrate constituted a perplexing irratio nality but an irrationality consistent with their unwillingness to know that the Earth is ﬁnished 76 6 13 Commencing his daily routine Deckard detects involuntarily the taint of death in the air 5 On ﬁnally ﬁnding the electronic toad he persuades himself is real a very difﬁcult twentyfour hours later Deckard muses that it has survived even that which were not really managing to survive and thus epitomizes the unacknowledged reality of life carefully buried up to its forehead in the carcass of a dead world 21011 Thinking that he too may have already used up his little time Deckard reﬂects that at some point ﬁnally the dust will have won 86 Yet humanity persists in its routine pointedly like Reschs squirrel which has a wheel in its cage It runs and runs the wheel spins but the squirrel stays in the same spot Reschs concession that Buffy seems to like it though prompts Deckard to observe in a dry commentary on the human condition in general and humanitys bad faith in particular I

of species as reported monthly in Deckards muchstudied copy of Sidneys Animal and Fowl Cata logue yet people had stopped reading the perpetual animal obits in the newspapers years before and the absence of any organized gov ernmentsponsored breeding program suggests that everyone knows the situation to be hopeless and irreversible Dick 7 37 This bad faith is compounded by the fact that those

had bom barded Mercers brain with radioactive cobalt to prevent him from bringing dead animals back as they had been because the killerslike and symbolically those who had caused the fatal nuclear war and consequent extinctionsare collective humanity as well 12 27 20 Of course as Mercerism its empathybased and implicitly govern mentsponsored religion is integral to and inseparable from this soci etys badfaith effort to deﬁne human as possessing empathy it too is a locus of bad faith Mercers virtual passion in which anyone can participate via the empathy box is to climb a hill while being pelted with rocks to be killed at the top by the killers and plunged into a pit of corpses and dead bones the tomb world until the bones strewn around him grew back into living creatures and then to begin to ascend along with them until he found himself evidently climbing alone again in a neverending cycle of death and rebirth 2021 In addition to enacting this societys wishfulﬁllment fantasy of restoring extinct species this mythology and the fact that Mercer is always renewed rises inevi tably And us with him intimates that humanity is eternal too 67 Yet laying bare the psychological mechanism of bad faith which is to be in complete possession of the truth one is hiding from oneself Mercer tells Deckard via the empathy boxand thus osten sibly tells everyoneYou must go on as if I did not exist There is no salvation do your task even though you know it is wrong It is the basic condition of life to be required to violate your own identity 156 The revelation of Mercerism is that Mercer epito mizing humanity is just an old man climbing a hill to his death 157 Similarly in conﬂating the passion of Christ with the eternal torment of Sisyphus who is condemned forever to roll uphill a rock that always rolls back down Mercers cycle per se allusively unmasks the weary entropic futility of this postapocalyptic existence as it simultaneously offers hope of resurrection and

very nature because the implicit deﬁnition of human as com municated by the action of the novel is that humans are creatures who survive by believing in illusions 193 And the novels most unequivocal theme is that faith enables people to survive regardless of whether the object of that faith is real or fake Both deﬁnition and theme are demonstrated on a large scale through Mercerisms very popularity and even more so through its inevitable persistence in the face of Busters expose but both are most emphatically and persua sively demonstrated on the more human scale of Deckers personal

articulated in many of these works through technologically produced and reproduced human minds and bodies Fredric Jameson has argued that the representation of aliens of their bodies cultures and societies flourishes in anglophone science fiction in the 1960s and 1970s while from the early 1980s on science fiction shifts from the classic or exotic alien to the representation of the alien other as the same namely the android whose differentiation from the ear lier robot secures a necessarily humanoid form This may be said to be the moment of a kind of Hegelian selfconsciousness or reflexivity in the genre in which our attention and preoccupation as readers turn inward and meditate on the android cogito which is to say on the gap or flaw in the self as such 141 Jameson locates

produced and reproduced bodies and minds that ranges from dolls robots and cyborgs to children and quite prominently animals In stead of simply displacing the alien in favor of the android in other

animals as innumerable scifi aliens modeled on insects lizards or cats demon strate To put it somewhat differently aliens often present themselves as an amalgam of what one might refer to as emergent and re sidual dimensions of organic and cultural development in Raymond Williamss termi nology 4042 They embody on one hand humankinds possible technological futures and on the other hand forms of biology that in Western philosophy have often been associ ated with a past that needs to be superseded in order for authentic humanness to emerge5 By shifting its focus from the alien to the android or cyborg recent science fiction emphatically places questions of technology at the core of the human self6 More than that it embeds technology in the history of the species by making it the tool of human biological evolu tion This turn is perhaps most obvious in the work of the cyberpunk novelist Bruce Sterling who not only argued in his preface to the pathbreaking anthology Mirrorshades 1986 that for the cyberpunks    technology is visceral It is pervasive utterly intimate Not outside us but next to us Under our skin often inside our minds xiii but also made biotechnology the prime engine of hu man evolution in his novel Schismatrix 1985 Relying on a vision of history derived from Ilya Prigogines brand of chaos theory which emphasizes complexification mechanisms Sterling depicts a future humanity that with the help of bioengineering and terraforming explodes into multiple posthuman daugh ter clades in Sterlings own words 109 170 with very different organic shapes and social structures aliens with human roots But the trope of the android or cyborg while it effectively reframed questions about advanced technologies did not address issues of biological otherness that the figure of the alien had also raisedissues that because of the rise of the environmentalist movement in the 1960s and 1970s the emergence of ani mal rights advocacy in the 1970s and 1980s Peter Singers

Advances in gene research and biotech nology during the 1990s most famously the realization of the old science fiction motif of cloning with the creation of the sheep Dolly in 1996 reinforced concerns about the role of the biological other in visions of human tech nological progress If the mechanical artifi cially evolved or cyborgized animals in recent science fiction allude to such concerns they nevertheless fulfill a narrative function differ ent from that of biologically exotic aliens in earlier novels One of the more conventional scifi plot patternsundoubtedly influenced in no small measure by cold war geopolitical configurationsinvolves the unification of humankind across national racial and cul tural boundaries in the face of alien contact or invasion The arrival of the biological other in such scenarios forces humans to acknowledge their shared planetary habitat and species be longing Aliens authenticate humanness by virtue of their biological difference much as animals did before Darwinian theory blurred the boundaries between beast and man Ani mals in recent science fiction offer no such sure touchstone of difference products of hu man technology they sometimes carry human genes or have become humans intelligent equals The assertion of human authenticity in such contexts becomes difficult or indirect and is often fraught with conceptual tensions

organisms even as conversely nonhuman genes form part of the new hu mans Atwoods affirmation that authentic humanness can be identified through culture therefore plays itself out in a context that is thoroughly posthuman in biological terms As these examples show science fiction texts of the last four decades in which aliens have by and large been replaced by a combi nation of technologically modified humans and animals tend to articulate humanist per spectives that sit uneasily with the hybrid and clearly posthuman social and biological envi ronments they portray Such ambiguities also surface in other media The television science fiction series Dark Angel for example focuses on transgenic subjects with superhuman abilities who have escaped from a govern ment lab where they were trained as human weapons But in its second season as the lab is burned down and all its inmates freed by some of the androids the series shifts more and more toward other experimental humans made with genes from dogs lizards and fish9 While animals as such do not appear the overall sense Dark Angel conveys is once again that the figure of the android or cy borg needs to be supplemented by that of the animal even though the series shortcircuits what insights might result from this tantaliz ing conjunction through a simplistic finale that assimilates all the varied android forms into an allegory

basset plays with a transpar ent toy sphere displaying a fish a motif that is echoed later in a scene in which what looks at first like a globe of Earth starts displaying the face of an ape and then of Batous dog as if to indicate how the world of humans who evolved from apelike ancestors is dominated by the animal even as humans have turned cyborg The last image of the film after a scene in which Batous partner Togusa has returned home to his daughter and given her a doll for a present shows Batou holding his dog in the same posture in which Togusa held his daughter The image of cyborg and dog outlined against the nocturnal silhouette of a thoroughly urban and industrial landscape both echoes and inverts Dicks reflection on replicants and animals As in Dick the technologically enhanced humans ability to bond with the animal serves as a touchstone of humanity But unlike Dicks androids the cyborg here succeeds in establishing that bond and the juxtaposition with the human

    ns1:text "of Electric Sheep Criticism on Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep has focused on androids and ignored animals The novels ethical concerns are best understood through animal studies revealing political deployments of the species boundary to disenfranchise certain humans The novel suggests another model of subjectivity best understood through Marxs species being entral to Philip K Dicks fiction is the question of what it means to be human a question generally explored through the opposition between authentichuman beings and various artificial beings made to imitate humans Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep whose popularity perhaps derives from the wide influence of the film Blade Runner which it inspired is his best known novel in this mode Similarities and differences between the two texts have been discussed at length and it is not my purpose to rehearse or contribute to those arguments or to engage with scholarship on these differences Rather I want to focus attention on an aspect of the original text neglected in both the film adaptation and criticism the importance of animals elec tric and real Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep develops its ideas about being human through two comparisons animals and androids Dicks novel is set in a future earth that has been devastated by nuclear war Most of the population has left the planet a colonization effort aided by the free labour of androids Those left are either too poor to emigrate or else are designated specials a category denoting decreased intelligence and hence ineligibility for emigration Mosaic 401 00271276071110160200Mosaic Androids are illegal on earth although some have escaped slavery in the colonies and try to pass as human They are hunted down and killedretiredby bounty hunters such as protagonist Rick Deckard The remnants of human culture are held together by a religion called Mercerism which is practiced through empathic fusion with others via a technology called the empathy box Animals almost or perhaps actually extinct are sacred to the religion of Mercerism and the culture in general Owning and caring for an animal is a sign of ones social and economic status and also an expression of ones humanity Androids in contrast do not care for others neither animals nor other androids Their inability to feel empathy is what sets them apart from humans and justifies their enslavement and execution Organic machines androids can only be distinguished from humans through the VoigtKampff test for empathy which measures involuntary emotional response to certain questions predominantly about abuse and exploitation of animals There is a general critical consensus that the novels major concern is with alien ated modern technologized life rendering humans increasingly cold and android like While this argument usually concludes that Deckard is healed by reconnecting with nature most critics ignore the important role of animals in the novel and the specificity of the category of the animal in Western culture1 Ursula Heise one of a few critics attentive to the animals concludes that although animals are crucial to the definition of what is human the novels theme is that the technological simulation of animal life 79 is a sufficient substitute for real animals In contrast to such read ings I argue that the representation of animals is central to the novels critique of the Cartesian subject and commodity fetishism and that only by realizing the centrality of animals can we perceive all the implications of Deckards change It is not as often argued that Deckard risks becoming increasingly like the androids through his work as a bounty hunter rather the risk faced by Deckard and other humans in the novel lies in realizing that they already are androidlike so long as they define their subjec tivity based on the logical rational calculating part of human being T he version of the human self that emerges in the novel can be traced back to Descartess cogito which marks the entrance of a number of important distinctions that have structured modernity Descartes conceptualized the human self as separate from nature including the nature of its own body He also argued strongly for an absolute split between humans and animals asserting that animals are merely mechan ical beings undeserving of our empathy rather than living and feeling creatures like ourselves Descartes based this conclusion on his conviction that animals do not have mental capacities as do humans and thus while animals might feel sensation they Sherryl Vint cannot experience pain as such Instead animals respond to stimuli as if they were automata made of of bones muscles nerves arteries veins instead of wheels and other parts 41 acting only from the disposition of their organs 42 rather than from understanding The philosophical problem with which Descartes struggled how to distinguish man from an other in this case animalsis the same question with which Dick continually struggles Descartess sense that animals are simply machines responding as designed is similar to the way androids are positioned within Dicks novel they appear to act as do humans but lack some nonmaterial capacity mind for Descartes empathy in the novel that would make them truly the same as humans Tom Regan offers a sustained critique of Descartess notion of animal sub jectivity in The Case for Animal Rights see 325 Nonetheless as Gary Francione points out in Animals Property and the Law despite this critique and new develop ments in the study of animal consciousness since Descartes scientific practice regard ing animals continues to be structured by the assumption that they do not feel pain as humans do 22024 Descartes used such distinctions to insist that the cogito or thinking self was dis tinct from all other life Dick on the other hand critiques the cogito and emphasizes the fragility of such demarcationsAt one point in the novel an android tortures a spi der in order to discover how many legs it can lose while still being able to walk This is typically described as the moment when the androids truly inhuman nature comes to the surface and all sympathy for them is lost Another way of reading this scene however is as disinterested experiment rather than torture mirroring the technique of scientists who were and often still are able to perform painful experiments on living creatures without any concern Thus android subjectivity is similar to the Cartesian model of subjectivity used to justify the exploitation of animals because of their mechanical nature and lack of a soul The Nexus6 androids explicitly labelled these progressively more human types Dick Do 54 show us the limitations of the Cartesian self The Cartesian self is clearly not the only way to understand human sub jectivity but as scholarship on posthumanism has established2 it is a model that per sists in many of our assumptions around identity and technology It is further central to Dicks own concerns with human and android identity Despite the need to posit empathy as the defining characteristic of human beings in order to distinguish humans from androids in the novel the actions of most normal humans in the novel suggest subjectivities still dominated by the rational calculating logic of the cogito Animals have long figured in Western religious and philosophical traditions as the other of humans In many ways Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep simply puts androids in the place historically occupied by animals They are classified as lessthan human and any evidence of capacities they might possess that runs contrary to the hege monic ideology such as Lubas appreciation of art is ignored The reasons given for treating androids as disposable are clearly linked to human dependence on exploitable android labour without which no one would have been able to escape the declining earth From this perspective the treatment of androids within the novel comments on our historical and current exploitation of animals and also our exploitation of those humans who have been animalized in discourse such as women the working classes and nonwhites particularly slaves The homologous situations of androids and animals draw our attention to the discourse of speciesism The term speciesism came into popular use through Peter Singers Animal Liberation He begins with Benthams assertion that the critical question to ask about animals is can they sufferrather than the more familiar ones such as can they use tools language reason etc Singer links the capacity to suffer to the philosophical notion of having an interest in ones welfare Possessing or lacking interest determines the dif ferent ethical categories that humans and animals occupy Singer defines as speciesist a prejudice or attitude of bias toward the interest of members of ones own species and against those of members of other species 7 and argues that this attitude must be understood in analogy to sexism and racism The question of speciesism has long been central to arguments for animal rights3 and has recently also become of interest to philosophers of ethics in general and to the emerging discipline of animal studies Such scholars have drawn attention to the way the category ofanimalfunctions ethically and politically to disenfranchise certain humans in the ongoing political deployments of this species boundary There are many reasons that it is imperative at this time to reexamine both the category of animal and also our material relationships with nonhuman ani mals the humananimal boundary is being breached by genetics research and practices such as xenotransplantation the biodiversity of our planet is rapidly disappearing as species go extinct we live in a society founded on the exploitation of animals for food and other resources and developments in animal cognition suggest their capacities for things they were once denied such as emotion consciousness and tool use The philosophical importance of the category of the animal is significant for understanding Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Derrida has argued that the ques tion of the animal is crucial for metaphysics as Western subjectivity is based on a logic of sacrifice and carnophallogocentrism 114 which privileges human over animal as much as it privileges man over woman Giorgio Agambens work in Homo Sacer and The Open argues for the centrality of biopower to modern political life an exercise of power founded on the separation of bare biological life from the proper life of the citizen which is also the separation of the animality from the humanity of homo Sherryl Vint sapiens He concludes The Open by arguing that this conflict is the decisive political conflict which governs every other conflict 80 The central questions of the dis course of animal studies like the central themes of Dicks fiction concern the ethics and ambiguities of what it means to be human These tensions are revealed in the novel through the problematic representation of Deckards work as a bounty hunter Although Deckard is supposed to rationalize his work as a bounty hunter while still theoretically maintaining his reverence for empathy he comes to realize that doing so requires precisely the sort of affect and cog nition split that makes him both a proper Cartesian subject and an android subjectiv ity experiencing emotions only as programmed He understands that the ethical stan dard he is required to believe in is In retiringie killingan andy he did not vio late the rule of life laid down by Mercer You shall kill only the killers Dick Do 31 but he also realizes that the killers is an ideologicallyconstructed rather than onto logicallygiven category As Deckard observesit was never clear who or what this evil presence was A Mercerite sensed evil without understanding it Put another way a Mercerite was free to locate the nebulous presence of The Killers wherever he saw fit 32 Thus like the test for empathy that divides androids from humans the line drawn between human and nonhuman that justifies the use of violence without eth ical consequence exists only when and where its existence needs to be constructed Despite the centrality of the humanandroid distinction to the novels politics from the opening pages it is shown to be constructed rather than natural When we are first introduced to Deckard the artificial simulation of emotions is normalized over their natural expression as he Deckard has an epiphany when Luba is killed At this point Deckard has met another bounty hunter Resch who is untroubled by the dissociative state required to retire androids Deckard realizes that while he would have no difficulty killing Resch he does have difficulty killing Luba whose singing he has appreciated This leads Deckard to realize that his work as a bounty hunter emerges not from the difference between humans and androids but because there is not a sufficient difference to maintain the economic exploitation upon which their world rests Deckards discov ery that he feels empathy for androids is the first sign that he is becoming a new sort of human one who cannot separate cognition from affect and thus is resisting becoming like an android himself He realizes Perhaps the better she functions the better a singer she is the more I am needed If the androids had remained substan dard like the ancient q40s made by Derain Associatesthere would be no problem and no need of my skill 99 Once he has this insight that his skill is about making rather than policing a boundary Deckard is unable to continue as before An insufficiently new relationship with animals lies at the heart of the problem of android subjectivity Most of the scenes in the novel involving animals show that the animals exist as commodities rather than as beings for the humans in this world Deckard fears that his neighbours will discover that his sheep is electric because of the loss of economic status this would imply there is no sense that the death of his real sheep caused him any grief on a personal level nor that his relationship with the elec tric one is different in any way Similarly when Isidores employers discuss the acci dental death of a real cat which was presumed to be artificial they are not concerned about the loss of a unique and beloved pet or the suffering the animal experienced at death Instead its the waste 77 that bothers them and their discussion immedi ately moves to insurance and replacement costs The wife who took care of this cat decides to replace it secretly with an electric one as her husband never got physically close to Horace even though he loved him 81 and so will not notice the difference During her empathy test when told about a banquet at which dog was served Luba responds Nobody would kill and eat a dog  Theyre worth a fortune 103 a nonempathic response that marks her as an android but which is nonetheless con sistent with attitudes toward animals displayed by the human characters The only character to demonstrate concern for animals as something other than commodities is Isidore but as a special he is faulted for his inability to distinguish between real animals who deserve our sympathy and electric ones whose seeming pain is irrelevant Like the androids Isidore occupies a marginal ethical position in the novel Peter Singer argues in Animal Liberation that if we are to be nonspeciesist we must accept that if we are willing to justify our exploitation of animals for experiments Sherryl Vint based on their lesser mental capacity and thus lesser capacity for suffering then this same argument gives us a reason for preferring to use human infantsorphans per hapsor retarded humans 16 When Isidore transports what he thinks is an arti ficial cat in his faux animal hospital van he finds himself distressed by its anguish even though he knows the anguish is simulated He tries to convince himself that the cats evident distress is the sound of a false animal burning out its drivetrain and power supply but he still finds that the experience ties his stomach in knots Isidore is not a good Cartesian scientist as he cannot refuse the empathetic response even though rationally he knows that this animal is electric just as Descartes and his followers knew that all animals were automata Isidore concludes that his response is related to his deficient mental status as a special but decides it is best to abandon that line of inquiry 72 Although Isidore abandons this line of inquiry it is central to the connections the novel articulates among humans animals and androids When he sees another being suffering Isidore is unable to suspend his emotional response and work out logically whether it is reasonable based on the status of the sufferer as real or artificial In fail ing to be the cogito model of subjectivity Isidore suggests a way of configuring sub jectivity that would take seriously the differences implicit in Mercerism and identifi cation with animals As Deckard later learns Mercerism rejects boundaries between self and other and hierarchies among living beings Although Deckard is supposed to rationalize his work as a bounty hunter while still theoretically maintaining his rever ence for empathy he comes to realize that doing so requires precisely the sort of affect and cognition split that makes him both a proper Cartesian subject yet also an android As other critics have argued by the end of the novel Deckard learns not to draw this line What has been consistently overlooked is that Deckard comes to this realization only through embracing animal being rejecting the speciesist discourse that attempts to construct hierarchies and divisions a logic that rejects humans like Isidore within the novel and which rejects animals and animalized humans in Western culture The humananimal boundary is used to dehumanize the other so that ethics do not enter into certain kinds of killing slaughterhouses android bounty hunters and concentra tion camps all operated on the same logic Cary Wolfe has argued that as long as the humanist and speciesist structure of subjectivization remains intact and as long as it is institutionally taken for granted that it is all right to systematically exploit and kill nonhuman animals simply because of their species then the humanist discourse of species will always be available for use by some humans against other humans as well to countenance violence against the social Other of whatever speciesor gender or race or class or sexual difference8 This distinction is the political core of why ani mals are in the novel it is essential that Mercerism is founded on empathy with ani mals as it is precisely the humananimal boundary that provides the grounds upon which to deny empathy and continue exploitation T he limitations of speciesism and the failure to realize meaningful relationships with animals within the novel are connected to its critique of capitalism and to Marxs analysis of the alienating effects of the commodity fetish Cartesian subjectiv ity relies on an idealist notion of what is essential about the human an essence of soul that humans are said to have while animals do not This results in a damaging rela tionship to nature and to others seeing them as exploitable resource rather than as subjects as means rather than as ends A more positive model of human uniqueness can be found in Marxs materialist notion of species being outlined in The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 Marx argues that humans are alienated from nature when they treat it as an object outside themselves to be appropriated rather than as a sensuous reality of which they are a part and with which they have a social relationship Humanity loses something when it relates to nature in this abstract way as in reality nature is a part of us not something separate Man lives on nature means that nature is his body with which he must remain in continuous interchange if he is not to die In being estranged from nature humanity is also estranged from itself we are isolated as individuals alone rather than as part of a species and part of the larger sensuous material world Alienation thus changes for humans the life of the species into a means of individual life Manuscripts 112 This alienated relationship to nature in which a part of human being is abstract ed outside self and then related to as a thing with power over humans is similar to Marxs notion of the commodity and the alienation that results from commodity fetishism The capitalist mode of production and the domination of the commodity form turn not only nature but also humans themselves into means rather than ends reducing human being to labour power and restricting human existence to merely work and the minimal needs to reproduce the labourers body for more work Gary Franciones analysis of animal rights law suggest that the category of propertycreates an insurmountable barrier for efforts to establish rights for animals in Western culture as property is as a matter of legal theory regarded as that which cannot have interests or cannot have interests that transcend the rights of property owners to use their prop erty and thus there will probably always be a gap between what the law permits peo ple to do with animals and what any acceptable moral theory and basic decency tell us is appropriate14 The androids can be understood as the end point of capitals drive Sherryl Vint work In commodity fetishism the social relation between producers exists as a rela tion between things apart from and outside the producers and through this substi tutiondefinite social relation between men themselves    assumes here for them the fantastic form of a relation between things Capital 165 In the novel animals are treated as commodities rather than as part of living nature with whom humans share being Thus the relation becomes alienated and alienating The unstable boundary in the novel between real and artificial animals suggests how living nature can become like the commodity a dead thing that only seems to have life and which dominates the human rather than being connected to humanity through social relations The point in owning an artificial animal is both to demonstrate to your neighbours that you have the capital to own an animal but also in theory to participate in an ethic of care for precious living beings However if empathy were as important to the experience of human culture as it is to the ideology of the humanandroid boundary then owning a real animal should be a social rela tionship not a commodity one This is not the case Immediately following the fight with Iran about the mood organ Deckard goes to the roof to find his artificial sheep chomping away in sim ulated contentment 8 a juxtaposition surely meant to make us question whether the sheeps simulated contentment is any different from the optimism Deckard has just dialled for himself When Deckard thinks of his dissatisfaction with owning the artificial sheep rather than the real one he used to have his thoughts are about the sta tus that each conveys as a commodity not about a difference in relationship affective or otherwise that he has with the electric animal In fact he insists Ive put as much time and attention into caring for it as I did when it was real 12 He is demoralized not because he misses his particular sheep but rather because of the effort of having to pretend the sheep is real Deckards alienation from his species being and a social relationship with nature is suggested by his resentment toward the commodity ani mal He thought too about his need for a real animal within him an actual hatred once more manifested itself toward his electric sheep which he had to tend had to care about as if it lived The tyranny of an object he thought 42 The structure of the relationship that humans have with nature within capitalist production produces this alienation and objectification Only in the context of species being is full human subjectivity and real empathetic connection to animals possible Animals as commodities are still ends whatever the rhetoric of empathy In Marx and Nature A Red and Green Perspective Paul Burkett argues that capital requires nature only in the form of separate material conditions for its appropriation of labor powers use value not in the form of an organic social and material unity between the producers and their natural conditions of existence 62 Capitalism can conceive of nature only as use values that can generate surplus value not leaving any space for use values that address human needs unrelated to the production of capital or the repro duction of humans as labour power alone The scarcity of animals within the novel and their status as precious commodities draws attention to some of the limitations of this capitalist model of relating to nature The remaining animals are all treated as pets a social relationship rather than through the more pragmatic models we cur rently have of relating to many animal species as food clothing protection labour power The gap between pets all animals in the novel and the many ways humans typically interact with animals present in the novel as the examples in the VK test point to our already alienated relationship with animals and nature Deckards struggle to have a noncommodity relationship with animals and oth ers within the novel reveals the damage that capitalist modes of relation have done to his subjectivity but also point given Deckards ability to change to a potential way out of such damaging social structures At the beginning of the novel Deckard con tinually thinks of animals in terms of their prices in Sidneys catalogue and he explic itly links the death of androids to his ability to attain this capital when he calculates with uncanny prescience the circumstances which form the plot of the novel that would lead to him being assigned a sufficient number of android bounties to afford a real animal However by the time he has retired this number of androids his under standing of his job and of empathy has changed and the mathematics of exchange do not work out quite as Deckard had intended When Luba dies Deckard shows his humanity by interacting with her on a level that is other than that of a commodity Even though she is an android and must be retired he still buys her a book of pictures from the art gallery gift shop Deckards humanity is expressed through his unwillingness to reduce Luba to simply a com modity or to allow his interactions with her to be on the level of commodity exchange He buys the book with his own money despite the fact that she will be able to enjoy it for only a brief period before her death When she is killed he systematically burns into blurred ash the book of pictures 134 ignoring any attempt to reuse it or recover its cost Resch objects to Deckards illogical actions but Deckard refuses to reduce his interaction with Luba or the book itself to exchange value Instead he insists on a social relationship gift and use value the pleasure it gave Luba before her death the pleasure he gets from giving a gift Although earlier in the day he was measuring the deaths of androids only in terms of dollars and the number of dead Sherryl Vint androids he required in order to afford an animal now values other than economic enter into his thoughts Deckard turns to animals hoping to find some sort of compensation for the change he is undergoing He realizes that he can no longer function as a bounty hunter as he can no longer sustain belief in the boundary between humans and androids Thinking of his feelings for Luba as compared to Resch he observes I rode down with two creatures one human the other android    and my feelings were the reverse of those intended Of those Im accustomed to feelam required to feel143 Realizing the risk in beginning to sympathize with androids Deckard immediately goes out and buys a goat in order to get my confidence my faith in myself and my abilities back 170 He tells IranSomething went wrong today something about retiring them It wouldnt have been possible for me to go on without getting an animal171 Deckard turns to animals in an attempt to embrace the emotional and instinctive part of him self yet still direct his empathy toward appropriate objects However this plan will fail for two reasons because trying to rationally control empathy misses the point and only reinforces the Cartesian calculating self and because Deckard does not know how to interact with animals as anything other than commodities Deckard was closer to getting his faith back when he chose a social rather than commodity relationship with Luba and until he learns to interact with animals as something other than commodities animals will not be able to heal him He needs to overcome the idea of human self as separate from nature and master over it and the triumph of commodity logic as humans relationship to the world Deckards reluc tance to enter into fusion and share his joy about having purchased an animal shows that he has not yet learned this lesson He is still thinking in terms of the logic of exchange and scarcity in which joy circulates in a zero sum game Iran encourages him to use the empathy box but he resists arguing Theyll have our joy    but well lose Well exchange what we feel for what they feel Our joy will be lost 174 Iran tells him this is the wrong way to think about the sort of exchange that the empa thy box represents which allows ones joy to be shared without being diminishedWe wont really lose what we feel not if we keep it clearly in mind You never really have gotten the hang of fusion have you Rick 174 Deckards career as a bounty hunter a profession which emphasises even more the Cartesian mindbody split in its separation of cognition and affect prevents him from comprehending fusion His sense that animals offer the source of his salvation is correct but he needs to learn to interact with animals on the level represented by Mercer who had loved all life especially the animals had in fact been able for a time to bring dead animals back as they had been 24 It is only through learning to be like Mercer learning a new logic of self that Deckard can hope to regain any sense of confidence other than that programmed by the mood organ When he is called to retire the three final androids in his weakened state Deckard decides his situation is worse than Mercers because at least he Mercer isnt required to violate his own identity 178 Mercer appears to show him he is not alone and tells him You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go It is the basic condition of life to be required to violate your own identity 179 Although Deckard does not yet under stand this Mercers comment suggests that so long as Deckard continues to be dom inated by the logic of commodity fetishism he will have to violate his own identity his species being It is only when he finds a way to reconnect to nature that he will be able to overcome his alienation and be a full human being Marx argues that production does not simply produce man as a commodity the human commodity man in the role of commodity it produces him in keeping with this role as a mentally and physically dehumanized being Manuscripts 121 By dehu manized Marx means specifically being turned away from species being from what is unique about human existence Species being is a relationship with nature that is non alienated a consciousness of oneself as part of a species and the sensuous world The humans in the novel cannot be effectively distinguished from the androids precisely because their humanity their species being has been alienated through a disruption of their relationship to nature the animals thus provide the key to healing this alienation but only if humans can develop the proper attitude toward them a noncommodity form notexchangevalue ethic of care such as Deckard finally arrives at After killing the remaining androids Deckard goes out to the desert by himself and it is here that he begins to form a different relationship to the world He finds a toad and muses so this is what Mercer sees    Life which we can no longer dis tinguish life carefully buried up to its forehead in the carcass of a dead world 238 Deckard is able to express the essence of Mercerismfinding life that is not distin guished from non life or from unworthy life seem to be the missing term but he has not yet fully understood his vision At this point Deckard still believes the toad is real and hence a miracle When he takes it home Iran quickly discovers that it is electrical Although Deckard is disappointed by this he eventually tells her it does nt matter The electric things have their lives too Paltry as those lives are 241 This realization is both a victory and a defeat for Deckard On the one hand it is his recog nition that one cannot stop the forces of death and decay that organic life is victim to that all he can do is move along with life going where it goes to death 242 On the other it is both an acceptance of death as a part of life rather than lifes end and the first time Deckard has been able to see what Mercer sees life in what had seemed a Sherryl Vint dead world More importantly it is a world to which he is connected and a world that might be restored to life if the alienated relationship to nature is replaced with one more nurturing of human species being and of nature itself What matters is not whether the animals are realor simulatedbut rather how we ethically treat the other what use we make of any differences that are found When the androids reveal Mercerism to be an illusion rather than a real vision they expect the entire practice of empathy boxes to disappear but they base this analysis on a rational rather than affective assessment of the situation In a vision Mercer tells Isidore that he is unable to perceive the fakeness of the set because Youre too close    You have to be a long way off the way the androids are They have a better per spective 214 This distant perspective this gap between self and world between cognition and affect is being alienated from the sensual world rather than a part of it A less distant relationship with nature comes from embracing our connections with animals The various ways that animals have figured in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep do not suggest that we should abandon the idea that there is a difference between humans and other animals but rather that we need to think carefully about the social relation with nature that we construct across these differences Deckards crisis occurs because he finds he is no longer able to maintain the proper dissociative attitude toward his job killing androids Marx argues that labour becomes a loss of self for the worker when labour is alienated which causes the worker to feel himself freely active in his animal functionseating drinking procreating or at most in his dwelling and in dressingup etc and in his human functions he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animalEconomic 111 Just as the novel warns us of the risk of becoming android it also points to the risk of becoming only animallike in our existence of failing to nurture aspects of human happiness and fulfillment that exceed the relationship of commodity exchange This emphasis on human uniqueness is not a devaluation of the worth of nature and of animals themselves but rather sug gests that to the extent that we fail to value such things as part of our own species being we fail to value ourselves Just as human emancipation requires that we rethink social relationships related to labour and production it also requires that we consid er our social relationships with animals and with nature There are alternatives to cap italist production in order to extract use values from nature different ways in which labour might be socially organized to create less exploitative relationships among people There are also different ways that we can conceive of the relationship between humans and the rest of nature different and less exploitative ways to organize our social relations with animals that do not require the religious fetishism of Mercerism and the cult of animal care presented in the novel but which equally should not return to the callous exploitation of factory farming inhumane slaughterhouses careless experimentation and animals manufactured for research In the novels final scene Iran orders electric flies for the electric toad a sign of love for her husband who is devoted to it 244 beyond reason beyond rationality beyond reciprocity Species being is social being a direct connection rather than an exchange through commodities Instead of using the Mercer empathy box to avoid being alone in this act of care for the electric toad even though it has no economic status as it is not real Iran and Deckard begin to find a way out of commodity fetishism They are learning to treat the toad with kindness rather than as a posses sion because it is the social relationshipnot the ontological status of the toadthat counts Marx argues Private property has made us so stupid and onesided that an object is only ours when we have itwhen it exists for us as capital or when it is directly possessed eaten drunk worn inhabited etcin short when it is used by us Manuscripts 139 Deckard makes his first steps toward escaping this logic and embracing social relationships when he buys Luba the book The end of the novel suggests he might continue in his care for his useless toad At the same time however Deckard and Iran remain in a world dominated by the commodity form and capitalist social relations Even their attempts to find a way out can be expressed only through the exchange of things in buying the flies Iran offers Deckard an object given as love instead of the direct expression of love Marx discusses the damage that is done to human species being when money is able to take the place of human attributes in interpersonal relationships It is the logic of exchange that money implies its ability to make equivalent things that are distinct which destroys human species being Assume man to be man Marx writes and his rela tionship to the world to be a human one then you can exchange love only for love trust for trust etc Manuscripts 169 Iran wants to exchange love for love but she is trapped in a world that allows her to offer only electric flies for an electric toad the paltry life of electric things Nonetheless in the discovery that the electric things do have a sort of life Deckard and Iran make some steps toward recovering their species being So long as they remain trapped in a world dominated by commodity logic their lives will remain tainted by something of this logic At the same time however the care offered to the electric toad also exceeds this logic and embraces something of human species being a connection that is not about exchanging care for value a relationship different than that Deckard had with his electric sheep The novels anxiety about the unstable boundary between humans and androids can thus best be understood as an expression Sherryl Vint of anxiety about the distorted life of humans under capitalism a life alienated from our species being In Man Android and Machine Dick specifically identifies that the difference between androids and humans as a boundary applied not to origin or to any ontology but to a way of being in the world 212 The central role of animals in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and the issues of species being that they raise show the need to struggle for a different way of being in the world This way resists commodification in our relations with one another and with nature to produce a bet ter future one in which humans might be fully human once again

Corresponding author Florence Chiew University of New South Wales Email florencechiewunsweduau httpwwwtheoryculturesocietyorg the human and the nonhuman is more given than interrogated In other words posthumanism calls into question the apparently obvious coher ence of human nature and aims to destabilize the basic premises of human exceptionalism ie the position that human beings are the most important species on the planet According to this line of critique human ways of knowing and being in the world do not have privilege or priority over the myriad variety of ways that nonhuman entities  eg computers animals plants microorganisms minerals and fossils  encounter and apprehend the world Signiﬁcantly the corollary of pur suing this perspective is to show that the identity of the human species is not uniﬁed or selfpresent but thoroughly implicated in the phenomen ology and ontology of other nonhuman entities Nevertheless the complexity of maintaining such a position is demon strated by the diversity of perspectives denoting where the exact locus of intervention lies posthumanism for some is about troubling the distinc tion between humans and nonhuman animals Wolfe 2010 Pettman 2011 Haraway 2008 for others posthumanism is about seeing the technological as an extension of human subjectivity Hayles 1999 2006 Thacker 2003 Miah 2008 for still others posthumanism is about interrogating humanitys role in environmental ethics Morton 2010 Pickering 2005 More recently the nonhuman turn epitomized by the intellectual movements of objectoriented ontology Harman 2002 and speculative realism Meillassoux 2008 rejects anthropocen trism by arguing that objects can exist independently of human thought and perception This shift in emphasis is also accompanied by a growing body of literature on anthropomorphic interpretations of animal sen tience Daston and Mitman 2006 Buller 2013 and morethan human environments Whatmore 2013 Jensen and Blok 2013 As Nikolas Rose puts it many things have led to this reframing of the human Some have to do with the cycles of theoretical fashion in the human sciences Some stem from a new sense of our precariousness as a species in the face of ecological threats and climate change 2013 4 Notwithstanding the diversity of possible reasons the stakes in managing and accounting for these conceptual conﬁgurations are signiﬁcant for how the fault line of discrimination between the human and the nonhu mananimalenvironment is drawn also motivates the reasoning behind claims for which life forms deserve more equitable kinds of moral treatment Yet interestingly although posthumanism as an intellectual move ment is marked by rather diverse lineages the competing moralities and seemingly opposed positions that shape its history share more in common than they may realize or like to admit In Scandalous Knowledge Science Truth and the Human 2006 Barbara Herrnstein Smith deftly captures the challenge posed by these varying intellectual commitments She points out for instance that the myriad factors Theory Culture  Society 314 motivating someone to appeal for responsibility toward one group and not another is as much a question about socialization political leanings and individual temperament as it is about being persuaded by an ethical cause Why we are drawn to a particular moral conviction or how we name and direct speciﬁc justiﬁcations for empathy or accountability raises emotionally demanding questions Smith oﬀers a compelling meditation on this issue The problem of our kinship to other animals mirrors that of our relation to other problematic beings for example the unborn the mentally disabled the drunk or the terminally comatose  beings that is who are recognizably our own kind but not yet not quite not just now or no longer what we readily think of as what we ourselves are 2006 153 emphasis in original Smiths poignant description here sums up the conﬂicting moralities that inform many a debate on what constitutes ethical culpability especially human responsibility toward the welfare of nonhuman others As Smith further elaborates matters become all the more contentious when the notion of responsibility is circumscribed by rather slippery identity mar kers that are used to stake a claim on which entity or group one is obligated to have regard for Should we she queries have care for dogs cats cows and horses but not birds snakes or butterﬂies For leopards and walruses but not lobsters or oysters For all these but not wasps ticks or lice Or for these too but not microbes or viruses 2006 154 In short Smiths searching questions illuminate the diﬃculty of determining what a proper aﬃnity between humans and nonhumans may look like or how the appropriate recipient of ethical consideration may be located Crucially the ambivalent meanings attributed to the status of the nonhuman often return us to a pervasive assumption namely that the originating source of responsibility is a human duty of care that is or ought to be extended toward other entities who will receive rather than enable it It is the underpinnings of this assumption that will concern us here As a prominent ﬁgure in posthumanist theory and the emergent ﬁeld of interdisciplinary animal studies Cary Wolfes work serves as an exemplary version of arguments that are persuaded by the prospect of a posthumanist ethics one which will cut across species barriers and in that respect mobilize a fundamental shift in our understanding of dis criminatory practices and moral responsibility This paper interrogates Wolfes posthumanist framework as he approaches the questions of activism and agency visa vis animal ethics and disability politics As will become clear although I share Wolfes aim in reworking traditional humanist tenets our arguments diﬀer on the problem of redeﬁning moral culpability as something that is peculiarly human By drawing Chiew attention to the contradictions in his own commitments to rethinking human exceptionalism this paper examines how Wolfes reading of abil ity and agency in animal rights and autism advocate Temple Grandin ironically reinstalls an understanding of moral agency that is grounded in the deﬁciency of another whose lack the human must supplement Nevertheless even though a critical tone will be apparent in my read ing of Wolfes posthumanist approach speciﬁcally of his conception of ethical responsibility the convictions that drive the following analysis bear considerable aﬃnity with his work In short the value of Wolfes theoretical rigour in rethinking humanist conceptions of ethics and sub jectivity is not repudiated Indeed in an eventual discussion of feminist and physicist Karen Barads work I suggest that the implications of Wolfes thesis of transspecies aﬃnity can be extended still further Wolfes brand of posthumanism is both ambitious and unusual as it brings together very disparate areas of thought Throughout his writings Wolfe makes sustained attempts to open up the question of subjectivity beyond species identities highlighting in many places that by identifying the presence of language conscious awareness and complex social behav iour in animals studies in areas as diverse as neuroscience cognitive ethology and ﬁeld ecology have troubled any neat distinctions separating the human from the nonhuman animal eg 2003a 2003b 2010 In What is Posthumanism 2010 a text now considered to be an important forerunner of the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of posthumanities Wolfe argues that one of his fundamental aims is to rework the ontologically closed domain of attributes thought to be uniquely human 2010 xxv He champions the cause for a transspecies empathy that will recognize the human as a human animal whose deﬁning characteristics are not so much exceptional as they are of a generalized animal sensorium Wolfe 2010 134 The notion of a transspecies aﬃnity is essential to the out comes Wolfe wishes to pursue However Wolfe reasons that this form of aﬃnity is at odds with the current debates around speciesism  attribut ing rights and values to beings based on their species membership Wolfe makes his stance expressly clear when he stresses that speciesism merits the same attention paid to the more familiar kinds of identity politics discourse against racism and sexism because the very rationale behind liberation and rights theories has in the past been used to determine and discriminate normal from less desirable kinds of human subjectivity The violence of humanism as Wolfe has reiterated forcefully is spe ciesspeciﬁc in its logic which rigorously separates human from nonhu man but not in its eﬀects it has historically been used to oppress both human and nonhuman others 1998 43 Within the contemporary context of animal ethics debates Wolfe points out that attempts to rethink the ethical status of animal subject ivity under the aegis of a more inclusive framework often rehearse an insidious form of humanism because they operate within the vernacular Theory Culture  Society 314 of rights and ability based discourse locked in a model of justice in which a being does or does not have rights on the basis of its possession or lack of morally signiﬁcant characteristics that can be empirically derived Wolfe 1998 13 On this topic Wolfe looks to renowned post colonial scholar Gayatri Spivaks deliberations on the anthropocentrism implicit in the history of liberationist political projects Many of these projects Spivak reasons circumscribe identity and ethics in terms of whether a being has made the qualifying cut for possessing properties that are deemed human enough The great doctrines of identity of the ethical universal in terms of which liberalism thought out its ethical programmes played history false because the identity was disengaged in terms of who was and who was not human Thats why all these projects the justiﬁcation of slavery as well as the justiﬁcation of Christianization seemed to be alright because after all these people had not graduated into humanhood as it were Spivak in Wolfe 1998 434 For Wolfe the gravity of Spivaks point has profound implications not just for thinking about humanitys moral obligations to nonhuman enti ties it is also a reminder of the atrocities that have occurred and continue to be exchanged within the human social community in the name of liberation and rights Explicitly drawing on this point in Animal Rites Wolfe asserts that the humanist concept of subjectivity is inseparable from the discourse and institution of speciesism    not only of animals but other humans as well by marking them as animal 2003a 43 empha sis in original Fundamentally Wolfe is guided by the conviction that what we have come to call ethics has from the outset been based on prejudicial practices That is received notions of ethics foreclose more inclusive frameworks because they are grounded in views that privilege the human as a species more deserving of moral attention For Wolfe a posthumanist ethics means broadening out the identiﬁcatory processes that deﬁne ethicality and subjectivity beyond species diﬀerences Given this what is curious about Wolfes more recent pursuit of a new conceptual conﬁguration of subjectivity  one that will unsettle the foun dation of human identity  is his concomitant resolve to hold forth on the particularities of the human In the opening pages of What is Posthumanism Wolfe writes The perspective I attempt to formulate here  far from surpassing or rejecting the human  actually enables us to describe the human and its characteristic modes of communication interaction mean ing social signiﬁcations and aﬀective investments with greater spe ciﬁcity once we have removed meaning from the ontologically Chiew closed domain of consciousness reason reﬂection and so on It forces us to rethink our takenforgranted modes of human experi ence including the normal perceptual modes and aﬀective states of Homo sapiens itself by recontextualizing them in terms of the entire sensorium of other living beings and their own autopoietic ways of bringing forth a world  ways that are since we ourselves are human animals part of the evolutionary history and behavioral and psychological repertoire of the human itself 2010 xxv empha sis in original This promise to deliver a greater speciﬁcity in deﬁning the human is one of the most exciting yet also challenging aspects of Wolfes posthuma nist appraisal how to secure the distinctiveness of the qualities that have deﬁned a speciﬁc humanism meaning consciousness reason reﬂection yet simultaneously situate them beyond their conventional human identiﬁcations To pursue this paradox Wolfe brings into conversation the theoretical trajectories of animal ethics and disability studies He ﬁnds common ground in these areas insofar as both challenge a model of subjectivity and experience drawn from the liberal justice tradition and its central concept of rights in which ethical standing and civic inclusion are pre dicated on rationality autonomy and agency 2010 127 The oppor tune example of this union Wolfe locates in the story of animal rights activist and autism advocate Temple Grandin As this move to amalgam ate the aims of animal ethics and disability politics forms a signiﬁcant aspect of Wolfes posthumanist thesis of transspecies empathy it is worth unpacking this line of reasoning paying particular attention to how Wolfe consolidates the notions of contingency and partial perspec tive in his critique of the humanist trope of visualityasmastery 2010 131 Temple Grandin Visuality TransSpecies Affinity and Suffering as Compassion Temple Grandin is a famous spokesperson for animal welfare particu larly in the area of humane slaughter in the livestock industry of the United States As someone who has lived with autism from a young age she is also widely recognized for her autism advocacy In her auto biographical accounts Grandin 2006 believes that her visual acuity and sensory hypersensitivity as an autistic have enabled her to build a special bond with the livestock she works with and as a result have also led her to design more eﬀective and humane livestock handling facilities Inspired by these selfreports and by the enabling insights of Grandins autism Wolfe surmises that Grandins story opens up new lines of Theory Culture  Society 314 empathy aﬃnity and respect between diﬀerent forms of life both human and nonhuman 2010 127 In What is Posthumanism Wolfe draws our attention to Grandins belief that the visual acuity she developed as an autistic individual has enabled her to communicate without language or words During my thinking process I have no words in my head at all Grandin says When I lecture the language is mostly downloaded out of memory from ﬁles that are like tape recordings    I look at visual images on the computer monitor of my imagination then the language part of me describes those images Grandin in Wolfe 2010 130 emphasis in original Curiously and importantly Wolfe interprets this explanation as evidence that Grandin is able to express herself through a visual rather than a verbal register 2010 129 As we have seen Wolfes entry point for critique is his stance against the humanist assumption that animals and beings deemed less normal or diﬀerent to the autonomous human subject are perceived to be lacking in some element of subjectivity or the capacity to respond and speak for themselves In his succinct expression it would be overly simple but not wrong to say that the basic formula here has been no language no subjectivity Wolfe 2003b xvxvi Thus using Grandins story Wolfe seeks to overturn this longstanding assumption that only through lan guage is one constituted as a subject who has the capacity for experience reﬂection or intellectual acuity To further substantiate his claim of a transspecies connectivity vis a vis Grandin Wolfe suggests that Grandin is implicated in what are for humanism two ontologically opposed registers both of them rad ically inhuman or at least ahuman 2010 130 emphasis added Wolfe problematizes the notion of visuality as it is stereotypically expressive of the humanist ability to survey organize and master space 2010 130 emphasis in original He claims that Grandins visual acuity as an autistic subverts this assumption and argues that Grandins visual prowess which typically would be considered as an indicator of ability is instead oﬀered here as an index of dis ability 2010 130 emphasis in original At the same time Wolfe interprets this enabled disability as a condition that has allowed Grandin to think like a web browser like a recording storage and playback device 2010 131 He reasons that these notions of the technical and the mechanical often deemed inhuman or ahuman are recovered indeed intensiﬁed in Grandins hyperacute perceptual apparatus Taken together Wolfe claims that disability becomes the positive indeed enabling condition for a powerful experience by Grandin that crosses the lines not only of species diﬀerence but also Chiew of the organic and inorganic the biological and mechanical 2010 136 emphasis in original This point needs to be ﬂeshed out as it shapes the way that Wolfe develops his reading of ethical responsibility as transspecies aﬃnity Consider the following example Wolfe believes that Grandins hypersen sitive perceptual apparatus by virtue of her experience as an autistic has helped her design career in the livestock industry This follows from Grandins reasoning that the visual experience of a prey species like cattle is diﬀerent from that of a predator species like humans because cattles eyes are evolutionarily designed to be on the side instead of in front of their heads as we would ﬁnd in humans For Grandin as it is for Wolfe this insight into cattles wideangle vision has inspired her to make some signiﬁcant design changes in existing feedlots so that the cattle could more easily and willingly move through the chute In her recollection of these design projects Grandin insists that until I made this observation nobody in the feedlot industry had been able to explain why one veterinary facility worked better than the other 2006 22 Tellingly Wolfe goes along with this account and surmises that Grandins ability to relate her experience as an autistic with hypersensi tive sensory faculties enables an acute awareness of how diﬀerent a cows visual experience is from our own 2010 129 emphasis added This observation is then used to lend credence to the claim that visuality may be animal it may be technical but it is anything but human 2010 131 emphasis in original There are signiﬁcant contradictions in this line of reasoning that merit attention In Wolfes analysis Grandins visual proﬁciency aﬀords her a better understanding of the visual experience of cattle because this per ceptual acuity is enabled by her disability Here the causal connections that Wolfe makes are glib and much too swift It is one thing to argue for the enabling possibility of disability that we certainly dont have to read disability as lacking and opposite in meaning to ability but quite another to claim that ones disability identiﬁes a unique ability that ordinarily abled individuals are unable to achieve In doing so Wolfe reproduces the identity politics he wants to contest for he has merely tipped the fulcrum over such that Grandins disability is now cast as a special sense of sight an insight that normal or nonautistic individuals cannot access Wolfes objective in using Grandins story is to highlight the con founding of the visible and the invisible to complicate the received tradition of thinking that vision is the mark of discrimination between the allseeing knower and the one deprived of sight or insight Yet in this analysis the humanist assumptions that reinstate the notions of auton omy and mastery underpinning Grandins anecdotes are not called into question This is not to diminish both Grandins design achievements in the livestock industry and her contributions to autism therapy Theory Culture  Society 314 However positing Grandin as someone with special hyperacute sensory capabilities in order to displace the humanist trope of vision paradoxic ally shortchanges what is most profound about the empirical and phe nomenological structures of visuality for all of us What does it mean to extrapolate as Wolfe does in his engagement with Grandin that visuality is anything but human By arriving at such a conclusion that Grandins visual proﬁciency is somehow other or alien to us Wolfes reasoning recovers a rather standard and conservative view of ability that rests on the discrimination between those who have it and those who dont have it More disturbingly Wolfes claim seems to diagnose a moralism that runs counter to his overall commitments vision abled equates with the bad nonvision disabled equates with the good It is worth highlighting that Wolfes inspiration for a posthumanist conception of ethics comes from German sociologist and systems theorist Niklas Luhmann In Luhmanns systems theory communication and observation are cast as secondorder phenomena in that they rest on the impossibility of seeing ones own blind spot eg 1995a 1995b Thus for Luhmann as for Wolfe sociality is enabled by a certain per spectivalism in which seeing can only proceed by way of the partial or restricted nature of ones worldview To this end Wolfe suggests that one of the most valuable insights in Luhmanns emphasis on selfreferential blind spots is that it oﬀers a way to reconﬁgure the tension between claims for the contingency of observationknowledge and a correspond ing criticism of the inability of such claims to found their argument on convincing grounds Although he highlights this tension in a number of diﬀerent contexts there is one particular description Wolfe oﬀers that captures the conundrum at stake On the one hand the critiques of the traditional philosophical para digms of positivism empiricism and the like which stress instead the contingency and social construction of knowledge pragmatism poststructuralism materialist feminism would seem politically promising because they hold out hope that a world contingently constructed might also be diﬀerently ie more justly constructed But on the other hand that very constructivist account has left intellectuals seeking grounds for their own political practice without a foundation from which to assert the privilege of their own positions 1998 xii emphasis in original Here the challenge that Luhmanns systems theory poses is that assum ing any moral political or social position inevitably rests on an inter diction of selfexemption Luhmann in Moeller 2006 112 Stated diﬀerently a position cannot be posited outside the very problem it deems unethical Importantly for Wolfe what constitutes an ethical pos ition understood in terms of Luhmanns systems theory acknowledges Chiew that that position can only point selfreﬂexively to its guiding principles because its perspective is partial to itself It cannot step outside itself to gain a moral high ground over other positions We may recall that one of the most compelling insights that Wolfe oﬀers in his posthumanist theory is his critical acknowledgement that reworking humanist ethics and politics cannot simply mean extending the boundary conditions of acceptable or normal entry points to include the previously underrepresented or persecuted Indeed Wolfe is emphatic about this when he clariﬁes that his aim in using the story of Grandin is not to play the oldest and most predictable trump card in the identity politics deck  my constituents are more marginalized than yours 2010 140 However Wolfes critical acuity here appears to be at odds with his ethics of compassion Ultimately Wolfe appeals to the possibility of a posthumanist ethics in which subjectivity in his rendering is neither disabled nor normal but something else altogether a shared transspecies beingintheworld constituted by complex relations of trust respect dependence and com munication 2010 141 Accordingly for Wolfe this leads to a recon ceptualization of how ethically bound the human is to other forms of life bound in our shared vulnerability to other living beings who think and feel live and die have needs and desires and require care just as we do 2010 140 This undertaking points us toward the necessity of an ethics based not on ability activity agency and empowerment but on a com passion that is rooted in our vulnerability and passivity Wolfe 2010 141 emphasis in original To this end Grandin provides the context for Wolfe to marry the cen tral problematic of ethics or what constitutes moral standing with that of an identity politics that asks who is the subject of ethical consideration In this amalgamation of concerns Wolfe insists that it is only by recogniz ing a transspecies aﬃnity that the question of posthumanist ethics can be brought into a sharper focus However his overriding emphasis on the exceptional aspects of Grandins disability amounts to the claim that as a result of Grandins autism her visual acuity as a mark of her disability surpasses that of an ordinarily sighted individual In other words for Wolfes thesis to cohere his argument has to be staked on a logic of reasoning that is similar to the identity politics claims in question Grandin as disabled and because this disability provides her with an aﬃn ity with the cattle she works with is an identiﬁcatory process that singles out an ethical intervention But in doing so Wolfe glosses over the irony that by concurring with Grandin that her experience with autism has given her special visual abilities that otherwise normal individuals lack the very contention that Wolfe sets out to refute is unquestioningly rein stalled the humanist assumption of visuality as mastery as well as the sorts of abilitybased discourse that are grounded in debates over who has or does not have certain properties to qualify for moral consideration Theory Culture  Society 314 For Wolfe compassion with its literal meaning to suﬀer together is a way to connect with the nonhuman animal by recognizing the shared fact of suﬀering that underpins existence itself In other words acknowl edging an aﬃnity that is anchored in the poignant reminder of mortality and ﬁnitude regardless of species diﬀerence captures the most basic sense of compassion Importantly this reminder that we suﬀer together challenges the ontological containment of the human as a superior spe cies and interestingly returns us to the earlier problematic that began this discussion namely Wolfes intention to displace and sustain the speciﬁ city of the human This tension between repudiating humanism and maintaining the unique capacities of the human results from Wolfes interpretation of what is involved in an ethical relation The quandary is that Wolfes rigorous insistence on the ontological status of the human as always already a human animal is at odds with his investment in the question of ethical culpability as a responsibility that originates in the human and is extended toward the nonhuman animal In this delineation of what grounds an ethical relation prejudice is peculiarly human The diﬀerence between human and nonhuman one that is more assumed than proble matized remains intact Consequently Wolfes approach to the notion of transspecies connectivity remains wedded to a rather linear and derivative sense of human compassion toward nonhuman others who would receive rather than give or indeed enable it It is to this extent that I think Wolfe undercuts what could be a much more illuminating argument namely that to conceive the speci ﬁcity of human identity is to open up the very identity of life as some thing of a general sensorium in his own description a transspecies beingintheworld 2010 141 However if one subscribes to this read ing what needs to be confronted honestly and openly is that the trans species empathy that Wolfe encourages through the concept of compassion may not be selfevidently benign kind or good The cru cial point here is that if we are always already connected  indeed if connectivity is what aﬀords the ontological experience of our individual viability  ethics cant simply oppose the good to the bad one to the other or take the good with the bad one and the other What is needed is a diﬀerent understanding of the production of binarity itself Of course we are at this point faced with a profoundly unsettling suggestion for the radical sense of transspecies connectivity that Wolfe feels so strongly committed to must also imply that the questions of cruelty violence abuse or indiﬀerence do not disappear They endure because ethical responsibility this transspecies experience as a social fact of suﬀering compassion will compromise any pure sense of an opposition between good or evil benign or cruel  indeed not just between human and nonhuman animal but between human beings within the one socius Chiew Intraactive Entanglement Karen Barads Posthumanist Performativity To venture another reading of ethical inquiry I want to turn our atten tion to the work of feminist and particle physicist Karen Barad As one who not only practises science but also writes in the tradition of feminist science studies Barad occupies a unique position in which to reconcile the perceived incompatibility between notions of subjectivity and scien tiﬁc objectivity epistemology and ethics discourse and matter In Meeting the Universe Halfway Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning 2007 she oﬀers a refreshing and certainly coun terintuitive take on ethical responsibility and human agency Using the insights of quantum mechanics Barad proposes a posthumanist per formative approach to reexamine the representationalism and human ism that underpin conventional understandings of scientiﬁc knowledge and what grounds an ethical relation Against representationalist accounts that assume knowledge about nature or reality is mediated by human observation and language Barads thesis questions this long standing partitioning of matter and meaning nature and culture At the forefront of her argument is a profound sense of systemic entanglement that confounds the metaphysics of individualism in Western thought that is the belief that the world is populated with individual things with their own independent sets of determinate proper ties Barad 2007 19 Where traditional representationalism casts the inquiring subject as incontrovertibly human and distinctly individual Barads posthumanist performative approach radically opens up the question of how the human emerges in and even as the worlds self encounter As we will see the implications of this dilated frame of inquiry for thinking about ethics are farreaching According to Barad the physical phenomenon of diﬀraction is integral to the key insight in quantum mechanics that the observer and the observed are fundamentally entangled or indeed ontologically insepar able 2007 73 When two stones are dropped in a body of still water for example the resulting ripple eﬀect caused by disturbances in the water produces an interference or diﬀraction pattern In classical physics dif fraction is generally understood as the process by which waves bend around objects to produce alternating patterns of areas of wave intensi ties Barad 2007 77 Importantly in classical physics as Barad points out diﬀraction patterns can only be produced by waves and not par ticles since as separate portions of matter particles cannot occupy the same position at the same time 2007 81 However and this is what makes diﬀraction crucial to quantum physics under certain experimental circumstances diﬀraction eﬀects have been found for electrons atoms and neutrons  forms of matter routinely considered to be made up of particles ie discrete bits of matter This is the famous puzzle of the Theory Culture  Society 314 waveparticle duality typically associated with English scientist Thomas Youngs twoslit experiment As the twoslit experiment is central to Barads overall argument that epistemology ontology and ethics are inextricably intertwined it is worth mulling over some of its key provocations Originally devised to understand whether light is composed of par ticles or waves the twoslit experiment works by emitting a light source through two parallel openings on a plate and observing what happens on the screen behind when the light source passes through When a beam of light is emitted through the apparatus a diﬀraction pattern ie a wave emerges However when the light source is reduced such that only one photon is released at a time what is observed on the screen is not two scattered patches of light corresponding to where the photons are expected to land Instead what the screen registers is a wave a diﬀrac tion pattern This is a curious ﬁnding as it raises the question of what constitutes the nature of matter If only one photon is sent through the apparatus at a time what interfered with the photon particle to produce a diﬀraction pattern Puzzling over this Barad asks Does an individual electron interfere with itself Does a single electron somehow go through both slits at once How can this be Doesnt each electron go through one slit or the other 2007 102 emphasis in original The broader implication of the ﬁndings from the twoslit experiment is highly signiﬁcant If as classical physics instructs photons and electrons  bits of matter  are discrete particles with determinate properties then how can they also manifest wave behaviour since waves by deﬁnition cannot be localized to a single point How to put it another way is the nature of matter and light local yet general in its materialization Here we might recall a similar theoretical conundrum that Wolfe faced in his posthumanist project that insists on preserving the speciﬁcity of the human species and simultaneously reconﬁguring the human animal as something of a general sensorium While Wolfe does not frame his com mitments in terms of the quantum rendering of partwhole entanglement his acknowledgement that any posthumanist account is necessarily of a paradoxical nature because it comes both before and after humanism 2010 xv approximates the quantum insight that the emergence of one entity is somehow also an expression of its entire frame of reference Indeed one could argue that a convincing and cogent posthumanist pos ition is paradoxical because the production of its diﬀerence from human ism is not one of separation but of diﬀerential becoming This point will become clearer in a moment To get some purchase on the perplexing questions raised by the two slit experiment Barad turns her attention to the work of celebrated physicist Niels Bohr Bohrs interpretation of the waveparticle duality paradox challenges the representationalism and metaphysical individual ism inherent in classical approaches to value and measurement Chiew According to Bohr there is no sense in asking where the electron or photon is prior to the measuring process This is the basis of his indeter minacy principle which states that we cannot concomitantly know both the position and momentum of a particle because particles do not have ﬁxed values of position and momentum Barad 2007 19 In other words the waveparticle duality paradox for Bohr is not an epistemo logical problem about knowledge and uncertainty whether we can or cannot know reality Bohr argues that the waveparticle duality paradox evokes a fundamental question about the ontology of life and the nature of reality itself For Bohr there is no absolute distinction between matter and representation because the capacity of the apparatus that presum ably measures and gives meaning to the value of an object does not exist independently of the measuring process In the case of the twoslit experi ment the value of a particle that is whether matter manifests wavelike or particlelike properties emerges only in and as measurement itself In a series of gedanken or thought experiments  many of which with the beneﬁt of technological advances have actually been performed and conﬁrmed in experimental labs Barad 2007 105  Bohr demonstrates that matter will exhibit wave or particlelike behaviour contingent on the speciﬁc material setup of the apparatus used to measure the experimen tal outcome For instance by modifying the twoslit apparatus so that the upper slit is a movable diaphragm suspended from springs one would be able Bohr says to detect which slit each particles goes through by observing the amount of displacement created by the movable dia phragm Barad 2007 266 Now crucially the ability to determine which slit each particle passes through is not a result of a mixture of particles p 268 some of which enter the top slit while others enter the bottom slit but an experimental arrangement that makes it possible p 268 Bohrs critical insight into the waveparticle duality paradox is that value and measurement are coconstitutive the nature of the observed phenomenon changes with corresponding changes in the appar atus Barad 2007 106 emphasis in original If a particular experimen tal arrangement is designed to respond to the particlelike character of the object of inquiry then that is what is observed One ﬁnds particlelike behaviour and not a diﬀraction pattern Correspondingly if the experi mental setup is introduced to investigate the interference pattern of light or matter the material speciﬁcity of that arrangement conﬁrms it At ﬁrst glance this ﬁnding seems to suggest that the process and out come of the experiment are arbitrary However when read carefully the gravity of the point being made is that value or evaluation does not pre exist the apparatus it is materialized in and as the speciﬁc process of measurement that is carried out including the particular exclusions that are enacted This is an important point that bears reiterating For Bohr as Barad tells us the boundary between the object of observation and the agencies of observation is never ﬁxed as such 2007 114 Theory Culture  Society 314 Instead the very possibility of making this subjectobject cut presents itself as the moment of measurement arises and where certain choices are made to the exclusion of others Here signiﬁcantly any exclusion is constitutive of the apparatus since it enables and provides the condition for establishing boundaries and measurement interactions As Barad emphatically insists we are not entitled to ascribe the value that we obtained for the position to some abstract notion of a measurement independent object 2007 113 Rather what Bohrs analysis shows is that there is no unambiguous or inherent distinction between the human subject with the agency to observe and to measure and the object that is presumably nonhuman and outside the ﬁeld of agency In this confounding scene of agential entanglement even the question of what constitutes the boundaries of an apparatus is radically reconﬁ gured An apparatus for Barad is not a standalone instrument waiting to be applied to a particular experimental setup She says The particular conﬁguration that an apparatus takes is not an arbi trary construction of our choosing nor is it the result of causally deterministic power structures Humans do not simply assemble diﬀerent apparatuses for satisfying particular knowledge projects but are themselves speciﬁc parts of the worlds ongoing reconﬁgur ing To the degree that laboratory manipulations observational interventions concepts and other human practices have a role to play it is as part of the material conﬁguration of the world in its intraactive becoming Humans are part of the worldbody space in its dynamic structuration 2007 1845 This originary intraactive becoming does not imply that there are no diﬀerences between objects or events but that the production of any diﬀerence has no preexisting or independent reality outside the speciﬁc physical arrangement of the system or apparatus  the worlds self encounter and selfmaking The point as Barad states cogently is not simply to put the observer or knower back in the world as if the world were a container and we needed merely to acknowledge our situat edness in it 2007 91 emphasis in original Rather she argues we do not obtain knowledge by standing outside of the world we know because we are of the world 2007 185 emphasis in original Against conven tional understandings of causality time and space and the metaphysical individualism that assumes the world is composed of discrete and autonomous entities Barads notion of intraactivity makes a persuasive and timely argument against human exceptionalism Indeed as a radic ally diﬀerent kind of posthumanist intervention Barads argument reminds us that to destabilize the selfcertainty of humanism is to acknowledge that the human is an expression of the apparatus of life and world constantly taking measurement of itself Chiew An Ethics of Humanism Reworked If we return to Wolfes posthumanist ethical framework through Barads notion of intraaction it becomes clear that advocating for compassion as a form of transspecies aﬃnity is fraught with complication The rub is this a general sensorium as Wolfe proposes cannot exclude the disabled the animal or those who discriminate against them At stake then is not just an impugning of the privileged human subject for what is at issue pertains to the privileging of any identiﬁcatory process that promises to single out one point of diﬀerence as the locus of discrimination deserving of greater moral attention andor indictment Put simply what consti tutes compassion as a corrective for cruelty or injustice is not at all straightforward For if the question of ethics is truly opened up in a general sensorium that is an ethics that implicates all of life as a transspecies entanglement then the rightness or wrongness of an eth ical conundrum are not separate or opposing determinations Put plainly Wolfes notion of transspecies aﬃnity does not preclude compassion or violence The recognition that responsibility is not secured in one individual event or location will recast the very meaning of culpability and how we continue to approach questions of blame accountability and ethical relations To be sure this is not a suggestion that we relinquish our sense of personal agency because after all our intentions and interven tions are determined by the ongoing structuration of the world Rather it is precisely because we are the world we seek to understand that our participation matters Barad 2007 396 In this ethics of mattering how ever what constitutes culpability presents itself with all its inconsistencies and competing justiﬁcations as the quandary that changes and morphs into diﬀerent possibilities diﬀerent contingencies Consequently what determines compassion as an ethical response is invigorated as an involvement of these previous possibilities and not as a moral compass that orients us from a position outside the object of violation While both Wolfe and Barad make the argument that there is no privileged locus of observation outside or above the object of inquiry there is a decisive diﬀerence in the way that the same claim is made in their works Barads appreciation of the constitutive eﬀect of exclusions 2007 59 means that no perspective is simply lacking or partial Recall that for Wolfe via Luhmann it is the partial or restricted nature of ones worldview the impossibility of seeing ones blind spot that allows other secondorder observations to enter as remedial observations This is an important point for Wolfe given his commitment to the partiality and social contingency of the very concept of ethics Yet if we read Wolfes thesis of a general sensorium with Barads notion of intraactive becom ing one is faced with a view of ethicality that has farreaching implica tions even as it also raises discomforting questions about the nature of Theory Culture  Society 314 being Stated diﬀerently if the basic logic of selfreferentiality in systems theory is to suggest a more counterintuitive and implicated sense of what it means to assume an ethical position or perspective as Wolfe wishes to pursue this must also mean that the ethics and politics of discrimination are not outside ontology but are indeed what motivates and animates the system of life This sense of general systematicity can be found in Barads notion of the apparatus where every perceived separation or discrimination is not prescribed by or prior to its material conﬁguration If we heed this reading how we conceptualize the speciﬁcity of an entity or event will embrace a rather diﬀerent sense of what enables it in the ﬁrst place In other words taking Barads argument for the entanglement of know ledge and life seriously  we know because we are of the world  involves an understanding of ethical agency and accountability whose limits may not necessarily be conﬁgured by the human Indeed what constitutes the limits of the human in this confounding origin of intraactivity should be the question posed at the forefront of any inter vention into humannonhuman relations The point is not to deny or collapse the distinctions that are drawn between human and nonhuman animals Rather the more provocative suggestion here is that the perceived errors of humanism are also already facets of Lifes determination to organize itself understand itself to be present to itself  even in its missteps How we make sense of our rela tions in the world  in fact how we are the world making sense of itself  constitutes enduring questions about the nature of sociality that is the ontological inseparability of nature and humanity As Peta Hinton in her sustained engagement with Barad contends this ontological inseparabil ity implies that everything is accountable in the worlds diﬀerential becoming and the terrain of ethical inquiry shifts from how can I pro duce an ethical relation to the broader consideration of how am I produced ethically 2013 183 emphasis in original In this astute reconﬁguration of human exceptionalism Hinton reminds us that what is most instructive about Barads argument lies in its insistence that we participate in bringing forth the world in its speciﬁcity including our selves Barad in Hinton 2013 183 By implication then the very possibility of a posthumanist ethics cannot be located beyond humanism as a corrective for what appears to be lacking in humanist ethics and politics  at least not without being involved selfreferentially or diﬀractively in this general ecology of movement that is life Indeed if what determines an ethical call cannot be deﬁned outside of or prior to the instance of a moral quandary if the ethical does not preexist the scene of violation or error but is constitutive of it then ethical inquiry is an expression of the myriad ways by which Life bears itself It is in this sense that we may challenge and redeﬁne our views of culpability and moral responsibility as exclusively human Chiew Acknowledgements I would like to thank the six anonymous reviewers for the many insightful and generous comments on

humans and are re pelled by robots that resemble humans too much experiencing these alltoohuman robots as eerie and uncanny It argues that in ignoring time and lived experience the uncanny valley inscribes exclusionary boundaries around the human that are presented as inherent The es say places Moris theory into conversation with Philip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and what it identifies as the novels ontology of entanglement between human and nonhuman From this conversation it suggests that rather than wielding Moris uncanny valley to uncritically replicate and reify our biases about the human the uncanny valley can be viewed as a site that renders visible these boundaries and normative conceptions so that we might expand our visions of the human beyond them while examining the histories by which these boundaries emerge My own concern is    that the discourses and imaginaries that inspire robotic visions will retrench rather than challenge and hold open for

roundtable titled Robotics and Thought and to con tribute to a corresponding issue of the journal Energy1 The resulting essay Bukimi No Tani was featured in Jasia Reichardts Robots Fact Fiction and Prediction 1978 under the heading Human reactions to imitation humans or Masahiro Moris Uncanny Valley In 2005 Moris uncanny valley theory received attention at the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers IEEE Robotics and Automa tion Society International Conference on Humanoid Robots2 Also in 2005 roboticists Karl MacDorman and Takashi Minato released an English translation of the essay titled The Uncanny Valley which was circulated both within and beyond the robotics commu nity Since 2005 Moris uncanny valley theory has had significant influence in US humanoid robotics and recently the theory has also gained traction in discussions of human realism in computer graphics and film and video game animation In 2012 a new English translation of Moris essay was published in IEEE Robotics  Automa tion Magazine This version translated by MacDorman and technol ogy writer Norri Kageki is the first translation authorized by Mori3 This essay begins with a critique of the uncanny valley in par ticular of the theorys reification of the human as inherent and originary Bringing Moris theory into conversation with feminist science studies and queer theory I offer an alternative reading of the uncanny valley as a site of entanglementone that highlights and challenges constructed boundaries between human and nonhuman as well as opens up these boundaryconstructions for critical engage ment and historicization In engaging the uncanny in this way this essay also turns to Philip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep 1 Other roundtable participants included

novel like many of his works centrally features the uncanny as a force that destabilizes nor mative and exclusionary boundaries around the human Through these uncanny destabilizations Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep challenges both the fixity of the human and constructed borders protecting abiding definitions of the human The Uncanny Valley According to Moris uncanny valley theory humans are drawn to robots with some degree of human resemblance however hu mans are repelled by robots that resemble humans too closely The point at which the degree of human resemblance tips humans posi tive affinity into eerieness or uncanniness marks one boundary of the uncanny valley fig 1 As the graph in figure 1 illustrates Mori maps industrial robots on the low end of human likeness and thus of positive affinity A toy robot designed with more human traits a face a humanoid body evokes more affinity shinwakan And the traditional Japanese Bunraku puppet which bears an even higher de gree of human likeness and is encountered within the acculturated historical context of performance and audience expectations evokes an even greater degree of positive affinity Mori locates the virtually lifelike prosthetic hand in the space of negative affinity called the uncanny valley According to him were one to discover that such a hand is not a living human hand but a very lifelike prosthetic one would no longer feel an affinity to ward this hand in fact one would encounter this hand as eerie and uncanny For example while gripping what turns out to be some ones lifelike prosthetic in a handshake one might have expected the warmth and firmness of a human hand thus one would be tak en aback by the hands limp boneless grip together with its texture and coldness4 The dissonance between ones expectations and the prosthetics machine tactility would prompt one to experience the prosthetic hand as eerie In this way the virtually lifelike prosthetic hand lies in the uncanny valley where human likeness increases and affinity decreases see fig 1 Movement heightens the possible degrees of both positive affinity and eeriness that one might experi ence thus the lifelike prosthetic hand in motion the myoelectric hand in figure 2 elicits a greater sense of eeriness than it would at rest A closer look at the highest points on both graphs demonstrates Moris reliance upon what he calls a healthy person In figure 2 he 4 Masahiro Mori The Uncanny Valley trans Karl F MacDorman and Norri Kageki IEEE Robotics  Automation Magazine 192 2012 98100 quote on p 99 304 Configurations locates an ill person below this healthy person in both human like ness and positive affinity This healthy person which Mori evokes without definition or specification marks both the farthest point of human likeness on the xaxis and the highest point of positive affinity on the yaxis thus this healthy person is the standard of humanness against which both humanoids and humans are mea sured This healthy person in addition to evoking more positive af finity in humans than Moris ill person is also the imagined human who appropriately registers positive or negative affinity in relation to humanoid figures5 For Mori the centrality of this healthy per son emerges from our instincts for selfpreservation and avoidance of death6 Therefore in figure 2 the motionless corpse falls at the bottom of the uncanny valley accounting for stillness the zombie the animated livingdead falls at the bottom of the deeper valley accounting for movement Moris twofold goal consists of understanding the human by

necessary to createusing nonhuman designsdevices to which people can relate comfortably7 Keeping in mind the goal of designing robots that will not repel humans or cause them to feel uncomfortable Mori cautions that roboticists not design robots with too high a degree of human likeness instead he recommends that they aim for the first peak moderate human like ness and high affinity and avoid the second peak greater human likeness and higher affinity lest robots aimed toward this second peak fall into the uncanny valley8 The Uncanny Valley Labor and History Neither Moris uncanny valley theory nor his recommendations to roboticists differentiates between initial encounters with human oid figures and prolonged interactions with them For example if one were to have an initial uncanny response when shaking the aforementioned lifelike prosthetic hand over time and repeated handshakes one might no longer find anything remarkable much less uncanny about the prosthetic hand Indeed the hands bone 7 Ibid 8 Mori continues to stand by this recommendation see Kageki Uncanny Mind above n 1 p 106 Figure 2 Masahiro Moris uncanny valley graph with movement Source Masahiro Mori The Uncanny

seem strange or eerie but may become so familiar as to go unnoticed Therefore with time and repetition the prosthetic hand might move from within the uncanny valley to outside its borders9 In ignoring time and the sub sequent possibility of reorienting our affinitive responses to human oid technologies we ignore the discursive embodied and affective labors that bring these responses positive or negative into being10 In so doing we risk uncritically and erroneously privileging certain definitions of humanness as fixed and inherent holding up con ceptions of the human that hierarchize and exclude on the basis of this presumption In HumanMachine Reconfigurations Plans and Situated Actions Lucy Suchman addresses the roles of time repetition and labor in pro ducing fluid interactions with humanoid robots She writes specifi cally of her own stilted encounters with Kismet Cynthia Breazeals groundbreaking sociable robot that uses emotional facial expressions and nonverbal vocalizations to communicate with humans fig 311 During her visit to Breazeals lab Suchman recounts none of our party was successful in eliciting coherent or intelligible behaviors from Kismet12 She goes on to compare her partys unsuccessful interactions to the fluidity of Breazeals interactions with the robot The contrast between my own encounter with Kismet and that re corded on the demonstration videos with Breazeal makes clear the ways in which Kismets affect is an effect not simply of the device itself but of Breazeals trained reading of Kismets actions and her extended history of labors with the machine13 Sara Ahmed in her Queer Phenomenology Orientations Objects Others offers a useful discussion of such labor as an autoobscuring process According to Ahmed labor as history often renders itself invisible through its repetition 9 We might also understand Moris wariness of movement in robotic design through movements existence in time because to introduce movement is to introduce time 10 This lack of distinction between initial uncanniness and habituation over time is particularly relevant as Mori is participating in a larger conversation about designing robotic technologies for regular human use 11 Breazeal modeled Kismets interactivities on adultinfant interactions thus encour aging humans to take the lead in these interactions while similarly keeping expecta tions for Kismets performance low See Cynthia L Breazeal Designing Sociable Robots Cambridge MA MIT Press 2002 pp 3940 The demonstration videos can be viewed at httpwwwaimiteduprojectssociablevideoshtml 12 Lucy

paradoxwith effort it becomes effortlessis precisely what makes his tory disappear in the moment of its enactment The repetition of the work is what makes the work disappear It is important that we think not only about what is repeated but also about how the repetition of actions takes us in certain directions we are also orientating ourselves toward some objects more than others in cluding not only physical objects    but also objects of thought feeling and judgment as well as objects in the sense of aims aspirations and objectives14 14 Sara Ahmed Queer Phenomenology Orientations Objects

crucially orients us toward certain objects and relations and away from others obscures itself and its orientating work Indeed labors invisibility the performance of effortlessness is often its aim In the case of Kismet and Breazeal their effortless interactions emerge only by virtue of Breazeals ex tended history of labors with the machine And yet this seemingly effortless fluidity between Breazeal and Kismet obscures the very his tory of labors that brings this fluidity into being Tendencies that seem originary that appear as a priori or inher ent Ahmed argues in fact emerge from the histories of labors that orient us toward certain objects and relations and away from others What bodies tend to do are effects of histories rather than being originary15 It is on this theoretical groundingthis attention to labor history and the nonoriginariness of tendenciesthat I read the uncanny valley and its vision of humanness Moris theory takes as its starting point a specific tendency toward the human that hu mans respond in specific ways to different degrees of human like ness However as Ahmed asserts there is nothing inherent about this tendency rather these responses are produced through the his tory of repeated labors inscriptions and orientations Additionally the uncanny valley theory privileges Moris idea of a healthy person qua human holding it up both as the model for what a human should be and in his recommendation to avoid the uncanny valley in robotic design as that which should be safeguarded Thus the un canny valley theory and its various robotic applications inscribe as inherent nonoriginary tendencies toward the human overlooking not only the constitutive histories and temporalities that produce these tendencies and ideals but also their effects and consequences in the present and future In a recent interview Mori describes the uncanny valley as my intuition And later in the interview he continues pointing out the existence of the uncanny valley was more of a piece of ad vice from me to people who design robots rather than a scientific statement16 Considering both Moris description of the uncanny 15 Ibid 16 Kageki Uncanny Mind above n 1 pp 112 106 Prior to this interview several roboticists have critiqued Moris theorization of the uncanny valley on the grounds that it is largely speculation and not based on empirical or theoretical evidence Regarding the adherence to the uncanny valley despite the speculative nature of its claims David Hanson argues that Mori put forth the uncanny valley as speculation not as a true scientific theory But he drew it as a graph and that made it seem more scientific Its not a scientific hypothesis that was tested with data though qtd in Tom Geller Overcoming the Uncanny Valley IEEE Computer Graphics and Applica Rhee  Beyond the Uncanny Valley valley theory as intuition and the theorys widespread application I suggest that we engage his uncanny valley its healthy person qua human and his observations about industrial robots toys and pros thetics as normativizing claims17 As Karen Barad suggests in the epi graph such claims about the human should not be taken for granted as universal inherent or originary nor should they go uninterro gated The uncanny valley the imagined human it holds up as its exemplar and the boundaries between human and nonhuman that it presumes are in fact deeply embedded within constitutive his tories of cultural technoscientific political discursive and embod ied practices Therefore the uncanny valley theory functions less as boundaryidentifying rule than as boundarymaking practice18 Suchman describes normative and essentializing impulses in hu manoid technologies as abstractions in which the human is typi cally stripped

underscores is a term with shifting definitions and imaginaries And these definitions and imaginaries possess tre mendous ideological force that operates largely through their ability to go

Uncanny Valley offers a way to rethink Moris essay as productively challenging the very human abstractions that form the basis and center of his uncanny valley theory In other words Moris uncanny valley can be reoriented away from boundarymaking and boundarypolicing practices and toward locating and highlighting where abstracting and normativizing borders around the human have been drawn hence making these boundaries and their histories of labor visible for critical engagement23 In this reading the uncanny valley theory in revealing and destabilizing the boundaries placed around the hu man allows us to in Suchmans words challenge and hold open for contest received conceptions of humanness24 A Few Remarks on Translation My discussion of Moris uncanny valley as a site of destabilization emerges from the 2012 English translation of the essay Considering the wide circulation and influence of the 2005 English translation it is important to note a significant difference between these two trans lations In MacDorman and Minatos 2005 translation as in Reich ardts 1978 discussion shinwakan is translated as familiarity25 but in the 2012 translation it is translated as affinity Notably neither familiarity nor familiar appears anywhere in the 2012 transla tion This shift in translation is significant because the quality of fa miliarity unlike that of affinity relies without exception upon prior knowledge and habitual experience26 In earlier translations then 23 Within this approach it is of particular importance to engage the nonneutrality of these boundaries in relation to their funding structures including major robotics funder DARPA Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and its militarized priorities 24 Suchman HumanMachine Reconfigurations above n 12 p 239 25 In 2007 Christoph Bartneck and colleagues questioned earlier English translations of shinwakan as familiarity suggesting that these deviate somewhat from the original Japanese We also questioned whether Moris shinwakan sic concept might have been lost in translation and in consultation with several Japanese linguists we dis covered that shinwakan is not a commonly used word nor does it have a direct equiv alent in English In fact familiarity appeared to be the least suitable translation com pared to affinity and in particular to likeability Bartneck et al Is the Uncanny Valley an Uncanny Cliff p 369 26

of familiarity pushed the uncanny valley toward existing relations and definitions of the human the axis of affinity pushes it toward forging new humanmachine relations and poten tially imagining new

the Uncanny Valley the author as fearlessly and ingeniously playing with issues of the uncanny in his stories about androids and AI31 Like Barad Dick in his engagements with the uncanny refuses to take the distinction between human and nonhuman for granted Indeed this refusal is at the center of much of his work Rather than offering worlds in which clean distinctions can be made between human and non human Dicks fictions explore unavoidable entanglements between human and nonhuman and among self other and world The question of the human is a central preoccupation for Dick whose explorations of it often take shape through what we have been discussing as the uncannyan unsettling confusion about the boundary between human and nonhuman32 Often staging extended uncanny confusions that invariably dissolve the boundaries between human and nonhuman other Dicks work points to the important boundarydestabilizing work that the uncanny can perform In so doing his engagement with the uncanny points to the human as in sympathy with Fuss Ahmed Suchman and Barad a deeply fluid and shifting construction that emerges through acts of boundary creation and boundarypolicing33 Artificial

devolution of humans in Dicks oeuvre in his earlier work artificial humans are merely automatons in subsequent works they become progres sively more human with their own identity will and agency Mean while as Dicks artificial humans become more human his humans become increasingly machinelike and schizophrenic withdrawing from the world In the final stage of human devolution these schiz oid humans with their mechanical personalities resemble Dicks preevolved and nonagential early androids34 Kim Stanley Robinson in discussing Dicks reversals of existing sciencefiction conventions also writes of Dicks robots as ontologically bound to questions of the human Instead of the robot is just like us the approach often taken in earlier robotthemed science fiction Dicks robotsseldom robots as such but rather androids or simulacra emphasizing their human exteriorsconvey the message we are just like the robot35 Imposter a short story that takes place within an extended ex perience of uncanny confusion brings this inextricability of human and humanoid to the fore The story centers around the question of whether Spence Olham is human or a robot imposter an animate bomb36 sent to Earth to kill Olham take his place and detonate Olham believes he is human however he learns that certainty guar antees nothing as a robot imposter would be similarly certain of its humanness Therefore for humans and robots alike uncertainty pervades in a way that imagines both the limits of René Descartess cogito I think I am human but am I really and its heft If robot Olham thinks he is really Olham who is to say that robotOlham is entirely incorrect This disconcerting uncanny confusion centrally drives the story human and robot are deeply entangled with both human and robot imposter coexisting as viable and virtually indistin guishable possibilities Is Olham a human or a robot imposter This question is resolved in the last sentence of the story However I will leave us suspended in this

of Electric Sheep earth is bleak deteriorating and virtually uninhabitable for humans and animals alike The remaining humans live in constant fear of World War Terminuss radioactive fallout which the novel assures us no longer immediately kills but now only deranges minds and genetic properties37 Those who did not emigrate to Mars live with the everpresent threat that they will become spe cialsindividuals mentally and genetically affected by the radia tion Corporatized technology from moodregulating devices to an droids is inescapable in its hegemony And despite the scarcity of living animals the vastly popular religion of Mercerism mandates that humans demonstrate empathy toward animals hence the me chanical animal industry is flourishing including animal hospitals that repair mechanical animals while maintaining the secret of their artificiality38 In the immediate past of the novel a group of highly intelligent and dangerous Nexus6 androids fled servitude on Mars and infiltrated Earth It is the job of Rick Deckard android bounty hunter to track identify and destroy these androids Like much of Dicks work Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is rife with confusions inconsistencies and contradictions Char acters reality and central categories human android empathy are evolved several times over leaving the reader on unsure footing throughout the novel indeed nothing is as it seems John Isidore a special or socalled chickenhead demonstrates arguably the most sophisticated and insightful reasoning in the novel39 Humans who are defined by their privileged capacity for empathy demonstrate great cruelty to humans and androids alike40 And androids who are supposedly incapable of empathy exhibit great care and concern 37 Philip K Dick Do Androids Dream of

deems Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep one of Dicks outright failures42 Robinson pointing to the same confusion diverges from Suvins indictment of the novel Observ ing the symmetry between the androids inconsistencies and that of the novels human characters Robinson writes that certainly the novel is contradictory in its depiction of the androids and just as certainly this is deliberate on Dicks part    There is a symmetrical contradiction in the novels portrayal of the human characters Hu mans are in turn sympathetic and vicious43 Moving from an opening opposition between human and android to human empathy for androids to a concluding refusal to dehuman ize the android other the novel presents a series of uncanny moments that repeatedly upends notions of autonomy offering instead an on tology of intraaction and entanglement as described by Barad The neologism intraaction signifies the mutual constitution of entangled agen cies That is in contrast to the usual interaction which assumes that there are separate individual agencies that precede their interaction the notion of intraaction recognizes that distinct agencies do not precede but rather emerge through their intraaction It is important to note that the distinct agencies are only distinct in a relational not an absolute sense that is agen cies are only distinct in relation to their mutual entanglement they dont exist as individual elements44 41 More than once android Irmgard demonstrates concern for Johns feelings ibid pp 159 210211 42 Darko Suvin The Opus Artifice as Refuge and World

Valley Attending to the intraaction between humans and androids this sec tion traces the uncanny throughout the novel examining the un cannys simultaneous introduction and destabilization of boundaries as well as the mutual entanglements highlighted by the uncanny The novels first uncanny confusion introduces multiple tests for identifying androids only to undermine these tests in the same scene Rick Deckard successfully identifies Rachael Rosen as a Nexus6 android using the official VoigtKampff test which measures an individuals verbal and physiological responses to questions about animal cruelty Rachael and her uncle momentarily convince Rick that the test results are a fluke drawing on the very real possibility indeed the likelihoodthat the test would incorrectly identify schizoid and schizophrenic humans as androids45 Rick is persuaded believing Rachaels test results to be similarly flawedthat is un til he remembers his conversations with Rachael outside of the test questions Shifting from official to unofficial testing Rick recalls that during these conversations Rachael refers to her owl as an it It he thought She keeps calling the owl it Not her46 Rachaels pronoun slip is verboten in a society that views empathy toward animals as a primary index of humanness47 And it is this slip that correctly per suades Rick that she is an android Yet just as this scene challenges the authority of the official VoigtKampff test it also deauthorizes Ricks informal language test for if Rachaels pronoun slip identifies her as an android if this particular pronoun usage is the determining and damning criterion distinguishing human from android then Rick would also fail this test because he also refers to the owl as it48 45 This likelihood is raised earlier in the novel by Ricks boss Dick Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep above n 35 pp 3739 46 Ibid p 58 emphasis in original 47 That Rachael is revealed as an android because she disregards the gender of the owl interestingly inflects Alan Turings imitation game what we now know as the Turing test Turings imitation game begins with a man and a woman competing to be iden tified as a woman by a third human Turing then asks us to consider this game if the woman were replaced by a machine Prevailing understandings of the Turing test dis pense entirely with the question of gender around which Turing centrally organized his imitation game By returning gender both to the project of distinguishing between human and machine and to the project of being human this scene can be read as a striking critique of the various ways in which gender has largely been written out of the Turing test In Dicks novel it is precisely the act of doing away with gender that iden tifies one as nothuman 48 If you sold your owl he said to the girl Rachael Rosen how much would you want for it and how much of that down Dick Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep above n 35 p 42 In a further disorienting twist the scene concludes with the rev elation that Rachaels owl is in fact mechanical thus Rachael al though an android may not have revealed her own artificiality by referring to the owl as it but rather revealed the artificiality of the owl49 Ricks determining realization She keeps calling the owl it Not her while leading him to correctly identify Rachael as an android was premised on a flawed premise that the owl was a living animal This opening uncanny scene with its simultaneous introduction and deauthorization of multiple tests and their dizzyingly unstable criteria establishes that no boundary test or criterion to distinguish androids from humans is reliable much less infallible The following uncanny encounters set up machine intelligence and machine life as inescapably gendered In her masterful reading of Dick Katherine Hayles offers the schizoid android as a way to think about the triangulation of male subjects androids and schiz oid female subjects in Dicks works Gender dynamics is central to these complexities for when the schizoid woman is brought into close proximity with a male character he reacts to the android ism in her personality by experiencing a radical instability in the boundaries that define him and his world50 In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep genders boundarydestabilization is largely played out through language For example Ricks hunt for male Nexus6 android Max Polokov is relatively brief and unremarkable Polokov masquerading as Soviet bountyhunter Sandor Kadalyi introduces himself to Rick Moments later Rick without the aid of the Voigt Kampff test realizes that Kadalyi is in fact the android Polokov In this moment of realization Rick proclaims Youre not Polokov youre Kadalyi51 reversing the names of the human and android Despite this verbal slip Rick is neither uncertain about Polokovs android status nor conflicted about killing him nor is Polokov de picted in this brief scene as anything but a threat a dangerous brute Rather Ricks slip points to the paradox between the privileged role of language as an authoritative test to root out androids and the fal libility of language as a mode of communication 49 Ibid p 60 Indeed earlier in this scene Rachael refers to Bill the raccoon as he further highlighting the possibility that her use of it when referencing the owl emerged from the distinction between living and mechanical animals rather than from between living and mechanical humans p 41 50 Hayles How We Became Postmodern above n 30 p 162 51 Dick Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep above n 35 p 92 318 Configurations If Ricks encounter with Polokov is marked by its moral clarity and narrative simplicity Ricks encounter with his next android target female Luba Luft resonates with deep moral confusion and linguistic and narrative complexity At the beginning of his hunt Rick easily tracks down Luba who is hiding in plain sight as an ac complished opera singer On the stage Luba Luft sang and Rick found himself surprised at the quality of her voice it rated with that of the best even that of notables in his collec tion of historic tapes The Rosen Association built her well he had to admit And again he perceived himself sub specie aeternitatis the formdestroyer called forth by what he heard and saw here Perhaps the better she functions the better a singer she is the more I am needed    I wonder when I should do it he asked himself As soon as possible probably At the end of the rehearsal when she goes to her dressing room52 An opera lover Rick takes a moment to appreciate her voice then resolutely sets about the business of first administering the Voigt Kampff test then retiring Luba53 At this moment he is unconflicted about his task as he begins to speak with Luba however things become incredibly murky In her excellent essay Entering the Posthuman Collective in Phil ip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Jill Galvan offers a useful reading of Lubas VoigtKampff test54 According to Galvans discussion in the novel state power operates through language and technology permeating every aspect of daily life on earth Androids and humans alike even humans like Rick who ostensibly represent the law are subject to control and manipulation by the state Draw ing on Jean Baudrillard Galvan observes that in the test language is mobilized to assure the androids condemnation55 in large part by creating a nonreciprocal language encounter Deputized to ad minister the test Rick insists repeatedly upon Lubas response but 52 Ibid p 99 53 The novel oscillates between the language of killing androids and retiring an droids The former humanizes androids and dehumanizes android bountyhunters while the latter dehumanizes androids and deflects the inhumanity of those who de stroy them 54 Galvan describes the trajectory of the novel as against the designs and control techniques of the state Rick coming to terms with a posthuman community one in which humans and androids coexist and cooriginate See Jill Galvan Entering the Posthuman Collective in Philip K Dicks Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Science Fiction Studies 243 1997 413429 esp p 426 55 Ibid p 421 Rhee  Beyond the Uncanny Valley in Baudrillards view of course that response would only confirm the operation of the hegemonic code To respond means to submit to the codes inherent lack of reciprocity and thus to forfeit all chance of dodging the totalitarian order56 Nonreciprocity is built into the test such that any direct response to a question would trap and con demn the android Luba however momentarily subverts this trap of nonreciprocity by refusing to directly answer Ricks VoigtKampff questions For example in response to the question Youre sitting watching TV and suddenly you discover a wasp crawling on your wrist Luba responds with Whats a wasp    Do they still exist Ive never seen one    Tell me the German word    And what was the question I forget already57 As Galvan points out because of Lu bas evasive language maneuvers Rick is unable to get a VoigtKampff reading therefore she momentarily escapes being killed Expanding on Galvans reading of this scene I offer that Lubas language maneuvers extend beyond her test In fact prior to Rick ad ministering the test Luba employs language in a way that highlights the paradox introduced in the Polokov scene that language works against the androids both inside and outside the VoigtKampff test while languages authority is continuously destabilized by its dem onstrated fallibility Unlike Polokov Luba is able to exploit this lan guage paradox turning language against Rick and creating nonrecip rocal language traps that identify him as an android An android Rick said doesnt care what happens to another android Thats one of the indications we look for Then Miss Luft said you must be an android That stopped him he stared at her Because she continued your job is to kill them isnt it58 Luba takes possession of both languages nonreciprocity and the ex clusively human prerogative to identify androids In so doing she ar rests Rick destabilizing his previously secure and uncomplicated po sitions within language the state and humankind and ultimately turning his world upsidedown Lubas subversive languageexploits also carry with them a comparable force of the law which becomes evident when she calls a shadow police force to take Rick into cus tody This police force led by a Nexus6 android recognizes Rick not as a fellow officer they have no record of him but as a suspect 56 Ibid For Galvans discussion of Jean Baudrillard on language reciprocity and mass media see pp 420421 57 Dick Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep above n 35 pp 102103 58 Ibid p 101 320 Configurations Luba by exploiting languages paradoxical authority and fallibil ity turns Ricks previous authoritative relations to language and the law against him and it is after being so disoriented that Rick is re oriented beginning to newly empathize with Luba and becoming conflicted about killing her In his discussion of Dicks novel Fredric Jameson identifies the android cogito or I think therefore I am an android The android cogito Jameson describes is a peculiarly virulent and modern it eration of Cartesian skepticism that reverses the external issue of testing into a permanent rift within selfconsciousness itself59 Bringing the android cogito into conversation with the uncanny we might understand the rift that emerges in the android cogito as operating through humans troubling discovery of their similarities to androids and humans subsequent unnerving defamiliarization of themselves to themselves Thus the android cogito fundamentally destabilizes the subject because it requires simultaneous identifica tion and disidentification with humans and androids alike For Rick who is unwavering in the face of android accusations by Luba and officers in the shadow police station the android cogito is medi ated through fellow android bountyhunter Phil ReschPhil who is cruel and kills androids without psychic disturbance Phil who advises Rick to have sex with female androids before killing them Phil whom Rick despises and hopes will test as an android and im portantly Phil who is accused of being an android and unlike Rick is subsequently tormented by this accusation60 After a VoigtKampff test reveals Phil to be human Ricks world is again radically disrupted as he realizes that Phil is not an empathylacking android but that Rick himself is an inversely empathetic human who empathizes with Luba an android and not Phil a human61 While this uncanny in version this mediated android cogito confuses and depresses Rick it also shifts him further toward entanglement and intraaction 59 Fredric Jameson

unexplained and unspoken communication between Rick and John Isidore queers the authori tative function of spoken and nonreciprocal language as discussed by Galvan65 Warrick offers an important reading of John as Ricks lost second self their respective narratives paralleling and reversing each other throughout the novel While Rick metaphors law by hunting and killing androids Isidore metaphors love by caring for living and mechanical beings alike taking in and protecting the very androids that Rick is hunting Rick and John unite at the end of the novel when their twinned

I point to this narrative intersection as a moment not so much of unity but of entanglement as evidenced by the emergence of Rick and Johns telepathic communication about a living spider Near the end of the novel John looks down and miraculously spots a rare living spider on the ground On a step ahead of him something small moved in the dust67 Shortly thereafter Rick and John finally and briefly meet when Rick spots John releasing the spider into the weeds What did you do Rick holding the flashlight asked I put down a spider John said wondering why the man didnt see in the beam of yellow light the spider bloated up larger than life So it could get away Why dont you take it up to your apartment You ought to keep it in a jar According to the January Sidneys most spiders are up ten percent in retail price You could have gotten a hundred and some odd dollars for it Isidore said If I took it back up there shed cut it apart again Bit by bit to see what it did Androids do that68 This conversation comprises the entirety of John and Ricks spoken communication about the spider Following this conversation John refuses to lead Rick to the androids so Rick continues his hunt alone musing Ive never found a live wild animal It must be a fantastic experience to look down and see something living scuttling along Maybe itll happen someday to me like it did to John69 While Rick aptly describes how John came upon the spider in their brief encounter John did not mention how he acquired the spider much less that he had found the spider scuttling along on the ground And yet Rick knows marking a telepathic relation between the two men that bypasses spoken language which is too often the terrain on which authority is enacted and boundaries between human and nonhuman policed It is no small point that Rick and Johns telepathic communica tion revolves around a spider considering the centrality of animals as totems for empathy The spider is also connected to Mercerism which mandates

the desta bilizing force of the uncanny such that Rick and Johns telepathic connection emerges as an entangled bond one that circumvents the authoritative force of spoken language The novel spans a single day and a succession of uncanny confu sions between human and android living and mechanical In Dick fashion the novels conclusion is decidedly ambivalent As numer ous critics have observed it offers no resolutions by which narrative nor moral integrity is restored74 The closest approximation to a reso lution is Ricks resignation that everything is true    Everything anybody has every thought75 The novels conclusion also offers no possibility of escape no escape from technocorporate hegemo ny and no escape from the inevitable effects of postwar radioactive fallout There is only acceptance of this inescapability and the pos sibility of reorienting oneself in relation to these forces76 And this minimal reorientation from autonomy to entangled intraaction is the small victory that Rick claims at the end of the novel In this entanglement lies a tiny sliver of hope for him and his otherwise bleak and limited future 74 For example as Hayles describes the novels conclusion no big problems are solved here Only a modest accommodation has been reached infused with multiple ironies that emphasizes survival and the mixed condition of humans who are at their best when they show

Writer of the Digital Age New York Routledge 2009 p 8 Rhee  Beyond the Uncanny Valley The novel highlights this reorientation by mirroring its opening and closing scenes Opening on a scene of domestic disharmony in Rick and Irans apartment the novel begins with the couple argu ing about technology Rick is frustrated by Irans dissatisfaction with the mood organ and Iran demonstrating empathy toward androids calls Rick a murderer hired by the cops77 Their argument escalates concluding only when Rick dials moodaltering states on their re spective mood organs pleased acknowledgment of husbands supe rior wisdom in all matters for her and a creative and fresh attitude toward his job for him78 The concluding scene of the novel also takes place in Rick and Irans apartment their earlier disharmony replaced by tenderness as together they examine the toad come to terms with its mechanical state and accept its value as a creatureas life As the novel closes Iran is about to dial Ricks mood organ to 670 long deserved peace when Rick falls into a deep sleep No need to turn on the mood organ Iran realized79 because Rick had achieved longdeserved peace without its mediation In the open ing scene of the novel Iran contained82 Iran who whenever programming such deep despair made sure to program an automatic resetting at 481 several hours later Was Ricks deep questioning of reality throughout the day all the product of his earlier dialing for a creative and fresh attitude toward his job Does Ricks attaining long deserved peace on his own indicate that he is less dependent on the Penfield mood organ or has he so thoroughly absorbed the cybernetic circuit such that the absence of the mood organ only highlights the total control of the moodorgan technology on him Whatever the answers the novel ends with Iran in part because the novel cannot end with Ricks long deserved peace as such op timism would belie the impossibility of escaping the bleak realities of this world To end on Ricks peace would also belie the contradic tions paradoxes and inconsistencies by which he is able to achieve itkey among these that Rick only attains his concluding peace on the backs of the androids he killed Galvan describes this paradox through abjection Rick cannot see himself as part of a posthuman community until he has abjected himself in aspects both figura tive and literaluntil he has horrified himself as a murderer and by this act acknowledged himself as a nonsubject83 It is then only through his acceptance of his own inhumanity that he finds a more ethical relation with the world The novel through its multiple uncanny confusions redefines the human not through dehumanizing and excluding the android other nor constructing and affirming the radical alterity of the an droid but instead through acknowledging the deep inhumanity of the human Earlier in the novel Rick who is normally reluctant to engage with the empathy box takes hold of its handles and fuses with Mercer During this fusion Mercer appears bearing advice You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go It is the basic condition of life to be required to violate your own identity At some time every creature which lives must do so It is the ultimate shadow the defeat of creation this is the curse at work the curse that feeds on all life Everywhere in the universe84 This decidedly ambivalent resolution offered by Mercer and ultimately by the novel privileges the acceptance of ones own inhumanity over the dehumanization of the other What matters at the end then is Ricks acceptance of his own inhumanity in that it marks his refusal to dehumanize 82 Ibid p 239 83 Galvan Entering the Posthuman Collective above n 54 p 426 84 Ibid p 179 Rhee  Beyond the Uncanny Valley 328 Configurations android others even while killing them his refusal to participate in a certain kind of boundarymaking Conclusion Boundarymaking and unmaking If Ricks trajectory moves from agential autonomy to entangled intraaction the novel as a whole asks us to engage a larger ques tion posed by Suchman about how to configure humanmachine assemblages such that we can intraact responsibly and generatively with and through them85 For her responding to this question re quires an understanding of boundaries as constructed and never innocent Drawing on Barad Suchman writes that Barads agential realism reminds us that boundaries between humans and ma chines are not naturally given but constructed in particular historical ways and with particular social and material consequences As Barad points out boundaries are necessary for the creation of meaning and for that very reason are never innocent Because the cuts implied in boundary making are always agentially positioned rather than naturally occurring and because boundaries have real conse quences accountability is mandatory86 The accountability involved is not however a matter of identifying authorship in any simple sense but rather a problem of understanding the effects of particular assemblages and assessing the distributions for better and worse that they perform87 In thinking about Moris theory through this boundarymaking and meaningmaking we return to the uncanny valley and its pre sumed originary and fixed yet in fact culturally and historically specific concept of the human When read through Barad and Such man the uncanny valleys boundary between human and nonhu man as it is mobilized in myriad robotics practices and broader cul tural discussions of human realism does not highlight an inherent and inviolable border between human and nonhuman rather the uncanny valley points to a boundary that is agentially positioned and never innocent a boundary that is produced by histories of cultural social political technoscientific and embodied labors And the uncanny valley rather than policing or fixing this boundary can in fact open up Suchmans conception of accountability urging us to critically engage the boundarys histories and the relations and tendencies toward which it orients us 85 Suchman HumanMachine Reconfigurations above n 12 p 285 86 Barad Meeting the Universe Halfway above n 42 p 187 87

human and nonhuman animals Like farmed animals these beings are produced to serve humans clones are harvested for organ replace ment donations 3 in androids labor for their masters 30 settling Mars in Do Androids Dream Critics have read these novels as commentaries on liminality trauma commodifica tion and the limits of empathy While the importance of nonhuman animals is frequently noted or analogized in these readings critics nonetheless tend to ask how these texts question the idea of the human or contest human exceptionalism I propose instead that David P Rando ostensibly human concept of hope To erode the human monopoly on hope and see our fellow creatures as full not only of life but also of hope as these novels do opens new paths of empathy between human and nonhuman animals and makes it harder to accept the continuing instrumentalization of animals under capitalism Since the nineteenth century authors have codified realist and sentimental conventions for representing animal emotions including hope1 Allegorical representations of animals have an even longer history These literary modes have had a place in the cause of notic ing respecting and helping nonhuman animals The emotional appeal of Anna Sewells sentimental novel Black Beauty 1877 for instance prompted legal reforms in Britain concerning the treatment of horses While Black Beauty had direct effects on legislation many other realist sentimental and allegorical fictions have had subtler but nonetheless substantial effects on readers hearts and minds How ever new literary innovations for representing nonhuman animals are also important because they help to overcome readers cultur ally conditioned responses both to nonhuman animals and generic conventions themselves Literary and animal studies both need new possibilities for imagining and responding to nonhuman animals Science fiction and scifi adjacent or hybrid genres represent one rich area of possibility Critics characterize scifi as an ongoing discussion Mendlesohn 1 that is unusually responsive to emerg ing scientific and technological possibilities2 David Seed Although neither novel fits comfortably within genre designations Ishiguros clones and Dicks androids draw on scifi conventions to allow readers to experience the hopes of nonhuman beings while simultaneously circumventing the culturally entrenched barriers and resistances that often limit our ability to notice and imagine the lives of nonhuman animals3 These novels cultivate the ability to imagine the experience of nonhuman hope in contexts where this hope is cruelly and unfairly dashed and these novels work to demystify hu man hope itself Ernst Bloch the primary theorist of hope claims Hope this expectant counteremotion against anxiety and fear is therefore the most human of all mental feelings and only accessible to men 75 Blochs claim that hope is the most human expectant emotion is a human exceptionalist view one that understands humans as categorically different from and superior to nonhuman animals Blochs view is also anthropocentric seeing the world from a perspective that prioritizes human over nonhuman interests Blochs The Principle of Hope written beginning in the 1930s and published in three volumes in the 1950s is a work of extraordinary scope and imagination It constitutes a virtual encyclopedia of the ways that hope manifests in art praxis and culture yet Bloch stubbornly resists anthropomor phismthe attribution of supposedly human emotions to nonhuman animalsespecially the anthropomorphism of hope More recently scholars working in the interdisciplinary field of animal studies including work in ethology anthropology psychol ogy philosophy religion literary studies and more have challenged the taboo against anthropomorphism in multiple ways Taking up Darwins work on evolutionary continuity and animal emotion scholars are now more likely to regard emotional differences between human and nonhuman animals as matters of degree rather than of kind For instance Margo DeMello writes Darwin showed that all animals including humans share a continuum of mental and emotional capacities 414 Lorraine Daston and Gregg Mitman write The advent of evolutionary theory which posits phylogenetic continuities between humans and other animals has made the ban on anthropomorphism difficult to sustain in principle as well as in practice in the life sciences 8 Scholars have also become wary of anthropodenial Are We Smart Enough 319 a term coined by etholo gist Frans de Waal to describe the categorical denial that nonhumans share attributes with humans for such denials distort our vision and inhibit our relations with nonhuman animals5 Others such as Kari Weil call for strategic or critical anthropomorphism we might then David P Rando want to call an ethical relating to animals whether in theory or in art critical anthropomorphism in the sense that we open ourselves to touch and to be touched by others as fellow subjects and may imagine their pain pleasure and need in anthropomorphic terms but stop short of believing that we can know their experience 20 These critical and ethical impulses toward anthropomorphism and away from anthropodenial suggest how fully the field of animal studies is itself animated by a sense of hope and future Indeed Paul Waldau describes one of the tasks of animal studies as exploring future possibilities 4 Yet as much as the field is premised on evolutionary continuity and animated by hope scholars avoid hope when describing non human animal cognition and emotions Those in the sciences favor more emotionally neutral language such as future planning Are We Smart Enough 229 and delayed gratification to take de Waal as example though more recently de Waal has cautiously suggested that monkeys chimpanzees dolphins wolves elephants and perhaps farmed animals may well experience hope Mamas Last Hug 1396 Mark Bekoff describes his extraordinary book The Emotional Lives of Animals as a forwardlooking book of hope that stresses that we must be imaginative in our interactions with other animals xxi yet while granting animals the capacities for love gratitude joy humor wonder embarrassment grief sadness and more Bekoff discursively reserves hope as something that humans feel and by which they are motivated From an evolutionary perspective the wariness about nonhu man hope in animal studies and the jealousy with which Bloch re serves hope for humans seems counterintuitive if hope via Bloch can be understood as profoundly seeded in human life and experi enceand the field of animal studies is only one more example of thisthen it stands to reason that human hope probably enjoys a broad evolutionary basis The ubiquity of hope that Bloch finds wo ven into virtually every human practice would suggest that it is not an emergent evolutionary trait but rather a shared inheritance with certain other nonhumans whose experience of and capacity for hope differ from ours in degree rather than in kind7 Subfields that comprise or overlap with animal studiesinclud ing humananimal studies animal rights and animal welfare studies critical animal studies ecofeminist studies animality studies and posthumanist studiesvary greatly on the position of emotions8 Cary Wolfes Derridean posthumanism is discursively high on rigor and low on emotion taking animal studies seriously thus has nothing to do strictly speaking with whether or not you like animals 567 Wolfes stance has been critiqued by ecofeminist scholars who insist on combining animal studies with emotion and care Building on Josephine Donovans 1990 critique of how Peter Singers and Tom Regans animal rights philosophies similarly disavow sentiment and emotionality Susan Fraiman critiques Wolfes resistance to and even panic 100 in the face of potentially femininizing associations such as emotion Fraiman characterizes the work of Carol J Adams Barbara Smuts and Donna Haraway as open to and ethically engaged with emotion and care even though they fall into different branches of animal studies While the posthumanist animal studies that Der rida has inspired seems crucial for any attempt to reconsider hope in relation to human and nonhuman animalsas Wolfe suggests animal studies should locate interpret and challenge not only the animals out there among the birds and beasts but in here as well at the heart of this thing we call human 572it ought to do so without dismissing affectively informed fields of socially and ethically responsive cultural studies 568 for supposedly reifying wholesale the human as knowing subject9 Rather than conforming to a single trajectory within animal studies then the study of hope in animal studies must draw across subfields and branches following the trail of emotion past critical fractures while also questioning hopes construction and apportionment within the wider constructions of humans animals and animality From a strategic perspective if hope could be habitually es tablished as a common possession between human and nonhuman animals one more thread of the tenuous basis for human discrimina tion against and exploitation of animals would be cut10 One need not subscribe to a capacitiesbased philosophical view of animal rights which argues that rights should be extended to certain animals on the basis of how closely their capacities seem to resemble ours in order to acknowledge that this approach can have pragmatic and tangible effects11 If nonhuman animal hope were selfevident to humans sympathetic humans would generally be less likely to use abuse and dominate nonhuman animals Given wellestablished evolutionary perspectives the obstacle to nonhuman hope is not so much scientific but rather conceptual terminological philosophical and indeed literary What is needed is a way habitually imaginatively and conceptually to grant hope to animals However animal studies scholars understand that there is risk in projecting language and emotions onto nonhuman animals and of thereby supposing that we can fully understand animal experiences Presuming to know can become its own form of domination Litera David P Rando ture that represents beings who are neither human nor traditionally animal can help precisely here Because Ishiguro and Dick write about clones and androids rather than about nonhuman animals their novels can help to imagine and associate hope with nonhu man animals They do so not by falling into the trap of making the subaltern speak 20 as Harawaydrawing on Spivaks seminal essay Does the Subaltern Speakwarns scholars against doing but rather by creating liminal zones between human and nonhuman animals that open imaginative and empathetic spaces in which to explore the hope conditionshopes circumstances experiences and varietiesof dominated nonhumans These novels fulfill Weils criteria for critical anthropomorphism they allow us to touch and be touched by others as fellow subjects but without presuming that we can finally know the hopes of nonhuman animals12 These novels convey the injustice of continuing to ignore and deny nonhuman animal hope for instrumental purposes such as breeding laboring experimenting slaughtering and harvesting They help us cultivate a habit of affirming animal hopefulness To cultivate this habit of hopeattribution through fictions of liminality however requires strategies and techniques of reading different from those that literary conventions have conditioned in readers It is less by reading with concentration and more by holding these novels at arms length that such fiction can cultivate new habits of thought about the hopeworlds of nonhuman animals Arms Length Reading and Habitual Reception In Never Let Me Go Tommy above all is associated with animals After his early alienation from the other Hailsham studentsthe cultures euphemism for cloneshe is accepted back in the fold again 8 One student likens Tommys gesture to a dog doing a pee 10 Ruth calls him a mad animal 12 and even Kathy acknowledges that something about Tommy made one think well yes if hes go ing to be that daft he deserves whats coming 9 Kathy echoes Elizabeth Costello in J M Coetzees The Lives of Animals who says If I were asked what the general attitude is toward the animals we eat I would say contempt We treat them badly because we despise them we despise them because they dont fight back 58 When taunted by the other students Tommy does not fight back but rather pitches furious and impotent tantrums Late in the novel after Tommy and Kathy learn that there are no deferrals for their involuntary organ donations Tommy reverts to childhood fury running into an open field raging shouting flinging his fists and kicking out 274 When Tommy returns to the car Kathy says You stink of cow poo Tommy is also associated with animals because of his drawings Kathy calls them imaginary animals 178 and fantastic creatures Tommy draws these animals at the Cottages in a confused and ulti mately futile attempt to impress Madame with his creativity in the hope of a deferral for Ruth and himself Although Tommys draw ings fail to produce a deferral his inhuman art as Shameem Black argues which marries the animal with the automatic provides an alternative to the destructive visions of soulbased humanity that the novel critiques 801 Tommy explains his technique If you make them tiny and you have to because the pages are only about this big then everything changes Its like they come to life by themselves Then you have to draw all these different details for them You have to think about how theyd protect themselves how theyd reach things 178 Kathy is skeptical at first and worries that Tommy is only invit ing more ridicule But when she sees the drawings in the barn we called the goosehouse 186 she is startled by their intricacy So I was taken aback at how densely detailed each one was In fact it took a moment to see they were animals at all The first impression was like one youd get if you took the back off a radio set tiny canals weaving tendons miniature screws and wheels were all drawn with obsessive precision and only when you held the page away could you see it was some kind of armadillo say or a bird 187 emphasis added Kathy may echo readers own reactions to Ishiguros characters when she says of Tommys drawings I was becoming genuinely drawn to these fantastical creatures in front of me For all their busy metallic features there was something sweet even vulnerable about each of them 188 Tommys imaginary animals become a metacommen tary on how Ishiguro draws the characters themselves tiny detailed selfprotecting striving and vulnerable Their minute circuitry aligns them with forms of technological reproduction and cloning such as cassette tapes and radios As strange mixtures of repeatable and replaceable circuitry and unique individuality Tommys creatures center the novels concerns about humans and nonhumans repro duction and repeatability and striving and vulnerability As with Tommys drawings however we can only recognize the students as akin to nonhuman animals when we hold the page farther away and break off from their circuitrys minutiae This is to under take something quite different from conventional reading practices neither the concentration of close reading nor the computation of David P Rando distant reading it is reading at a middle distance at arms length Call it presbyopic reading as in middle age the object only comes into focus when held a certain distance away Never Let Me Go models other forms of reception as repetition and habit as well For example the Hailsham students listen to music with unusual but surprisingly effective innovation The craze was for several people to sit on the grass around a single Walkman passing the headset around Okay it sounds a stupid way to listen to music but it created a really good feeling You listened for maybe twenty seconds took off the headset passed it on After a while provided you kept the same tape going over and over it was surprising how close it was to having heard all of it by yourself 103 These too become instructions for alternate reading strategies To let the story play over and over as we tune in and out or to hold the book away from ourselves until something snaps into focus is to read the novel neither as a literal story about clones nor as an allegorical story about animals In defiance of traditional hermeneutics that call for concentration on the object as demanded by sentimentalism realism and especially as theorized by Adorno modernism we ought not concentrate on the students or interpret them as nonhu man animals Instead aligned with the technologies of cloning and reproducibility as Walter Benjamin theorized them we receive the students as animals in distraction at a certain distance Benjamin writes Distraction and concentration form an antithesis which may be formulated as follows A person who concentrates before a work of art is absorbed by it he enters into the work just as according to legend a Chinese painter entered his completed painting while beholding it By contrast the distracted masses absorb the work of art into themselves Their waves lap around it they encompass it with their tide 119 Never Let Me Go cannot be assimilated into realist sentimental or modernist modes nor can it persist as abstract or in tellectual allegory By situating readers in the oblique space between the literal and the allegorical and by allowing the matter of identity to remain permanently unsettled between concentration and distrac tion the novel allows readers to imagine nonhuman hope in ways that resist the conventionalized forms of representing it For Benjamin reception in distraction is especially valuable at historical junctures when the new cannot be accessed directly through concentration but only by gradual habituation and acclimation to the emergent For the tasks which face the human apparatus of perception at historical turning points cannot be performed solely by optical meansthat is by way of contemplation They are mastered graduallytaking their cue from tactile receptionthrough habit 120 Never Let Me Go works in our transitional moment of thinking about animals the novels vision of nonhuman hope must affect and wash over readers until they begin to form new perceptual habits The following sections examine how Ishiguros hopeful clones and Dicks hopeful androids might be read at arms length distract edly and habitually as a form of critical anthropomorphism compat ible with being touched by the hope of nonhuman others without the distorting and resistanceprovoking presumption that we can finally know the unknowable in them This mode of reception helps readers circumvent the distorting tendency to allegorize clones and androids as nonhuman animals even as these liminal figures help readers overcome the problems of identification and ventriloquism associated with realist and sentimental animal tales Clones Critics of Never Let Me Go have illuminated the novels inhuman or nonhuman challenges to conventional formulations of empathy and humanity For Black the novel reinvents empathy for a posthu manist age 786 by critiquing the limits of empathy in the human and locating selfrecognition and empathy in the inhuman in the mechanical manufactured and replicated Similarly by focusing on how the novel impedes traditional reader identification with protagonists Nancy Armstrong argues that Never Let Me Go pushes readers beyond the limits of sympathetic identification 464 and moves us to acknowledge those with whom we share vital organs yet whom we exclude from the mirroring relationship of sympathy For Anne Whitehead Never Let Me Go discomforts and perplexes readers in order to open up and to hold open central ethical questions of responsiveness interpretation responsibility complicity and care 59 while for Bruce Robbins the novel interrogates the boundary between care and cruelty true caring even love itself would neces sarily have cruelty in it 300 Eluned SummersBremner argues that animals in the novel are the natural foil to manufactured humans but also the regressive excessive element within ordinary humanity 155 from SummersBremners Lacanian perspective art addresses human exile from the land of instincts 147 Critics have thus established Never Let Me Go as a novel adept at challenging barriers within and surrounding the human This section takes the critical discourse of barriers to empathy and humanity in Never Let Me Go in an unexplored direction Examining animal hope in the context of David P Rando Ishiguros clones it articulates overlooked questions in Ishiguro criti cism and animal studies about who hopes and where hope resides By experiencing hope while resisting human and animal categoriza tion Ishiguros liminal clones liberate hope from human clutches Their crushed hopes not only interrogate the nature and limits of human empathy and identification but also dramatize hope in the process of breaking off from the human By allowing readers to be challenged and moved by nonhuman hope Never Let Me Go makes hope available to nonhuman animals in affective and conceptual forms that circumvent anthropomorphic projection presumption ventriloquism and mastery Hailsham students are not the pawns of fate and destiny in the way that traditional tragic heroes are nor does reading about their dashed hopes quite align with tragedys supposed effects of emotional catharsis through pity and fear however strong an emotional response Ishiguros story may elicit Utility rather than individual or communal destiny defines their futures Nor do the students fit neatly into the role of dehumanized people subject to the cruel power and uses of other humans as in certain representations of war slavery and genocide The students otherthanhuman status both in the eyes of the world and the ways in which they uncannily repeat individual humans while challenging the boundaries of the human itself keeps them partially outside of the genres of dehumanization and resists conventional emotional and intellectual responses to them But if Ishiguros students differ from traditional human char acters they also depart from conventional ways of representing nonhuman characters They are too human to fall neatly within the equally wellestablished conventions for representing nonhuman animals For instance they cannot be read as talking horses as in Sewells sentimental Black Beauty or Leo Tolstoys realist short story Strider In sentimental and realist modes respectively Sewell and Tolstoy depict their horses lives of cruel utility Sewells Ginger an abused horse delivers a sentimental speech shortly before her death Its no use men are strongest and if they are cruel and have no feel ing there is nothing that we can do but just bear it bear it on and on to the end I wish the end was come I wish I was dead I have seen dead horses and I am sure they do not suffer pain I wish I may drop down dead at my work and not be sent off to the knackers 162 Tolstoy renders Striders fatal visit from the knacker in realist style Theyre treating me of course theyre going to cure me he thought Let them Indeed he felt them do something to his throat It hurt and he shuddered and kicked out with one leg but he restrained himself and waited to see what else would happen What happened next was that he felt something liquid running in a thick stream down his neck and chest He heaved a deep sigh Then he felt much better 113 While Ishiguro draws on both sentimentalism and realism at different times Tolstoys and Sewells modes of nonhuman animal representa tion nonetheless align just as poorly with Never Let Me Go as the genres of tragedy and dehumanization do Instead the Hailsham students fall between categories and thus between forms of representation Instead of relying on such conventions the pathos of the Hailsham students derives from the novels carefully represented dialectics of hope and utility in an otherthanhuman context while simultaneously making it difficult to see the students as traditional nonhuman animals For instance the compassionate Miss Lucy admits to the children None of you will go to America none of you will be film stars And none of you will be working in supermarkets as I heard some of you planning the other day Your lives are set out for you Youll become adults then before youre old before youre even middleaged youll start to donate your vital organs Thats what each of you was created to do 81 Differing from Gingers sentiment and Striders realism both of which seem calculated to affect readers viscerally Miss Lucys tone is flatly unvisceral even though her topic is evisceration Not only are exotic hopes of being film stars out of the question but so are more mundane ambitions such as working in a supermarket or as Ruth later fantasizes an office Even the expectation of aging is dashed by the students ironclad futures And yet Hailsham students maintain their hopes in the face of certain instrumentalization The resiliency of their hope is part of their lives pathos Miss Lucy tells them If youre going to have decent lives then youve got to know and know properly But the students ability to know and know properly is limited not only by their careful Hailsham indoctrination neurosis willful not knowing and improperly knowing also perpetuate their hopes Childhood at Hailsham revolves around preserving illusions in the face of encroaching realities as exemplified by Ruths secret guard for Miss Geraldine Even without evidence that Miss Geraldine was threatened and needed protecting we each played our part in pre serving the fantasy 52 When the students reach adolescence and are more directly confronted with the truths of their existences they manage this knowledge neurotically through jokes We still didnt David P Rando discuss the donations and all that went with them    But it became something we made jokes about in much the way we joked about sex 84 Even at the Cottages the older students who have become carers while not actual taboo 132 subjects are rarely mentioned Although the novel makes fully identifying the students with nonhuman animals impossible Never Let Me Go plays extensively on human identitybased discourses about nonhumans Identitybased approaches regard nonhuman animals according to the relative de gree to which they possess traits and abilities that have traditionally been considered human Philosophers such as Aristotle Descartes and Kant have denied rights personhood and protections to non human animals based on their perceived lack of ethically relevant traits Calarco 4 or their supposed dissimilarity from human ani mals Darwinian evolutionary theory calls into question the categori cal distinctions that are common in the philosophical tradition by demonstrating continuity rather than difference Both utilitarian and rightsbased proanimal ethical approaches emerge from this understanding Nonetheless as Matthew Calarco writes when animal ethicists locate    quintessential human capacities say intentional ity or subjectivity among animals and build an ethics based on that shared identity they are not displacing anthropocentrism but are instead offering another iteration of it 26 The search for the hu man in the nonhuman is itself an anthropocentric enterprise even when it is conducted for the welfare or rights of nonhuman animals Never Let Me Go intervenes here through its discourse about the students relative capacities particularly through their capacities for creativity love and hope The students largely tie their hopes to ques tions of human capacities they see the basis of their hope as hinging on the extent to which they can evince these capacities Indeed Ma dame and Miss Emily had hoped that Hailsham would demonstrate to the world that because students possess certain capacities they must also have souls We took away your art because we thought that it would reveal your souls Or to put it more finely we did it to prove you had souls at all 260 While students elsewhere were reared in deplorable conditions 261 Hailshams freerange model set out to show the world that if students were reared in humane cultivated environments it was possible for them to grow to be as sensitive and intelligent as any ordinary human being However as Maren Tova Linett demonstrates the cognitive dissonance 145 in Hailshams approach which understands the students as cultured creative and intelligent 143 people who are simultaneously killable makes the Hailsham model unsustainable even as it exposes a similar contra diction at the heart of humane farming 145 Hailshams identity based approach to improving the way that students are treated loses out to the premium that humans place on anthropocentric utility While Madame and Miss Emily see artistic creativity as possible evidence of a soul the students regard creativity as evidence that they can truly love While Hailsham makes its argument through an implicitly

clutching her pillow supposes that Madame had been emotionally moved by Kathys demonstrated capacity to love Shed have supposed I was holding a lover in my arms    shed be really moved stumbling on a scene like that 177 Kathy learns much later that Madame had not connected the scene to love at all and had read Kathy quite differently For Madame Kathy was a little girl holding the old kind world 272 to her breast in the face of the hard cruel world that was coming rapidly Madame says I saw something else    It wasnt really you what you were doing I know that 272 Kathy imagined that Madame had been moved by senti ment but Madame had actually been moved by Kathy as allegory as something else as an otherspeaking figure Through the students hopes about being creative and having the capacity to love Never Let Me Go dramatizes what nonhuman hope might look like and how it might have a persuasive force If it is to be persuasive Never Let Me Go must be kept distinct from allegory on the one hand and from sentimentalism and realism on the other Reading in the distracted and habituating mode we see what nonhu man hope looks like when it falls outside of generic conventions and eludes traditional reading practices Miss Emily David P Rando turbing process Never Let Me Go represents is how thwarted hope gets rerouted into memory13 The novel dramatizes the wrenching mental processes by which the students are forced from hope into memory with the result that compensatory anamnesis and rumination replace a wishful sense of futurity Kathy says I was never the sort of kid who brooded over things for hours on end Ive got that way a bit these days but thats the work I do and the long hours of quiet when Im driving across these empty fields 58 The novels narrating clone dwells in memory and nostalgia during human young adulthood a time typically devoted to building an adult life and looking ahead with hope Kathys perverse shift from hopeful expectation to elegiac memory so badly distorts human life that the pain of dashed hope is dramatized in the very telling of the tale Androids Critics of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep often see the novel as opening displacing or radically transforming the human through its intersections with nonhuman animals and androids Ursula K Heise not only sees the novel as a potential indictment of Western cultures fundamental insensitivity to and relentless exploitation of animals 73 but also sees it as accepting technology to a certain extent as a replacement for irrecuperably lost nature 74 In contrast Vint shows that the novel puts androids in the place historically occu pied by animals Speciesism and Species 113 as the mechanical Cartesian other of humanity For Vint the novel is about the need for humans to resist our own androidlike and capitalist rationality by cultivating empathy with animals and resisting speciesism14 For Jill Galvan human encounters with androids and commodified animals in the novel interrogate a fixed definition of the human subject and at last acknowledge him as only one component of the living scene 414 Tony M Vinci sees trauma in the novel as temporarily liberating characters from essentialized human subjectivity and thus of opening us up to transsubjective engagements with the android and the animal that facilitate a radical posthuman ethics of expansive vulnerability 9415 For Casey R Riffel it is not trauma but rather apocalypse and historical rupture that make possible new forms of species relations 160 By reading the novel as a critique of capitalist exploitation instrumental rationality speciesism and anthropocen trism critics have positioned Dicks androids and nonhuman animals to challenge and reimagine the human in nonanthropocentric post capitalist and posthuman forms However Dicks android challenge to the human has unexplored implications for understanding non human animals as well This section examines the consequences of Dicks android representations for conceptualizations of nonhuman animals particularly in the field of hope Like the hopes of Ishiguros clones android hope in Dick dislocates hope from humans In the process it challenges the presumption that humans possess hope as such in its undivided fullness simultaneously liberating hope in a way that potentially enfranchises nonhuman animal others within the privileged construct of hope As in Never Let Me Go in Do Androids Dream humans discrimi nate against androids on the basis of capacities Androids resemble humans in virtually every way but for humans what decisively distin guishes androids is their inability to empathize Hope is central to the android experience but the way in which Dick represents empathy crucially contextualizes android hope Since the advent of androids a religion premised on the capacity to empathize has emerged in the world of the novel An android no matter how gifted as to pure in tellectual capacity could make no sense out of the fusion which took place routinely among the followers of Mercerism 29 Whatever else Mercerism might be it is also a spiritual and ideological develop ment that allows humans to retain a sense of exception as android technology throws the category of the human into crisis Dick reflects the tendency for humans to take a capacitiesbased approach for dif ferentiating themselves from nonhuman animals As de Waal writes Keeping humans in their preferred spot on that absurd scale of the ancient Greeks has led to an obsession with semantics definitions and redefinitions andlets face itthe moving of goalposts 157 Vexing this tendency however each new generation of androids in Do Androids Dream is more sophisticated intelligent and difficult to differentiate from human beings As in Never Let Me Go the tenuous sense of human distinctive ness is supposed to justify the instrumental use and killing of non humans in Do Androids Dream An imputed lack of empathy licenses humans to treat androids as Cartesian animalmachines not unlike electric sheep Rachael Rosen compares her fellow androids to ants Chitinous reflexmachines who arent really alive 178 She says We are machines stamped out like bottle caps Its an illusion that II personallyreally exist Im just representative of a type 173 Bounty hunters such as Rick Deckard hunt and kill androids without having to empathize with their victims or to question the morality of doing so As in Never Let Me Go killing is euphemized Hailsham students complete illegal andys 4 are retired David P Rando However the novel is practically anarchic when it comes to empathy and who possesses it In spite of their reputed coldness androids can form friendships and care about each other Led by Roy Baty the escaped androids have experimented with mindfusing drugs    to promote in androids a group experience similar to that of Mercerism 16970 The eight escaped androids empathize with each other and feel pain when their friends are killed When Deckard kills Irmgard Roy Baty    lets out a cry of anguish 205 This response leads Deckard to recognize an equivalency Okay you loved her Rick said And I loved Rachael Although the mechanical Cartesian view should preclude view ing androids empathetically the novel also presents evidence of hu man empathy toward androids Deckards wife Iran calls them poor andys 4 and Deckard begins to empathize with certain female androids and to love Rachael Rosen a development that threatens his work as a bounty hunter However the novel shows that the desire not to empathize can powerfully forestall empathy Deckard successfully battles his empathetic response in order to continue killing androids Ironically while Rick looks into the empathy box and experiences fusion Mercer tells him Go and do your task even though you know it is wrong 164 The imperative is so powerful that it remains entrenched even after it is grasped as wrong No matter how personally distasteful it becomes for Rick to retire androids his work remains ideologically and instrumentally essential Rick sees his particular form of suffering as worse than Mercers endless torment because Rick is required to violate his own identity If humans in the novel identify themselves through empathy then to act unempathetically is also to question the basic assumptions that underwrite human identity What is especially anarchic about Dicks novel and what makes it a crucial counterpart to Never Let Me Go is that it not only raises the possibility that nonhumans possess capacities denied to them but also assails the wellentrenched as sumptions that humans possess capacities we pride ourselves on Dick mirrors Derridas deconstructive approach to the nonhuman which consists of questioning not only what humans deny to nonhuman animals but also of questioning the cherished abilities that humans attribute to themselves It is not just a matter of asking whether one has the right to refuse the animal such and such a power speech reason experience of death mourning culture institutions technics clothing lying pretense of pretense covering of tracks gift laughter crying respect etcthe list is necessarily without limit and the most powerful philosophical tradition in which we live has refused the animal all of that It also means asking whether what calls itself human has the right rigorously to attribute to man which means therefore to attribute to himself what he refuses the animal and whether he can ever possess the pure rigorous indivisible concept as such of that attribution 135 Dicks novel questions the extent to which humans can possess the pure rigorous indivisible capacity for empathy By what right do Deckard and other humans call themselves empathetic As his fusion experience demonstrates Deckard must perform acrobatic rational izations to have his empathy and kill androids too The latest test used in the novel to identify androids the Voigt Kampff Empathy Test discriminates according to the ability to empathize with nonhuman animals Test takers are meant to react physiologically when the test administrator describes bearskin rugs lobsters boiled alive and wallmounted deer heads However Ricks own response to seeing or hearing about nonhuman animals is im mediately to consult his creased muchstudied copy of Sidneys Animal  Fowl Catalogue 9 to ascertain its exchange value For Rick animals are not to be empathized with but possessed owning animals assuages social pressures and signals prestige As Vint says if empathy were as important to the experience of human culture as it is to the ideology of the humanandroid boundary then owning a real animal should be a social relationship not a commodity one 11916 Instead as animals have become rarer within the world of the novel they generally seem more commodified than empathized with According to supply and demand animals are simply too scarce and expensive any longer to abuse kill or eat Given this instrumen talized human perspective Megan E Cannella sees animals as the guardians of unmediated emotion 147 in the novel After Rick discovers that he has begun to empathize with certain androids he becomes even more desperate to own an animal Buy ing a goat helps him to cope emotionally with his job Ive begun to empathize with androids he tells Iran Thats why I bought the goat I never felt like that before Maybe it could be a depression like you get I can understand now how you suffer when you are de pressed 161 Rick fixates on exchange value to the very last when he finds what appears to be a living toad First he swiftly dragged out his muchcreased Sidneys 217 and then finding that toads are extinct and knowing that an extinct animal can bring a reward running into millions of dollars 218 Rick thinks I need a box 217 A further irony about Deckards mercenary view of animals is that the toad is the critter most precious to Wilbur Mercer the para David P Rando gon of fusion and empathy The empathetic basis for discriminating between human and android is belied by the persistent and cultur ally entrenched human tendency to calculate coldly about animals Androids also expose the lie of human empathy Irmgard Baty says without the Mercer experience we just have your word that you feel this empathy business this shared group thing 193 Or as Buster Friendly puts it more bluntly Mercerism is a swindle The ones with the strongest shared group thing in the novel are the escaped androids Indeed humans and androids both need a supplement to feel empathy The androids need mindaltering drugs but the humans who pride themselves on the innate capacity for empathy nonetheless require the prosthesis of an empathy box that displays an actor against a backdrop of sky and daytime moon 190 The evil Killers 30 in Mercerite theology turn out not only to be the androids as Rick supposes but the humans as well Each is Mercer and Killer each can love and kill coldly at the same time The android Pris coldly snips off four of a spiders legs with scissors but Deckard picks off six of eight androids one for nearly every leg of a spider Like Derrida Dick shows that when it comes to the qualities that humans generously assign to themselves and parsimoniously withhold from others the sky is often painted Within this destabilizing context of empathy the novel suggests that nonhuman hope is widespread All androids who escape to Earth act out of hope for freedom and they are numerous enough to support a worldwide network of bounty hunters As Garland tells Rick about escaping from Mars Its a chance anyway breaking free and coming here to Earth where were not even considered animals 113 Do androids dream Rick asked himself Evidently thats why they occasionally kill their employers and flee here A better life without servitude 169 Dreams of a better life are the essence of hope and utopia Blochs original title for The Principle of Hope was Dreams of a Better Life and he observes How richly people have always dreamed of this dreamed of the better life that might be possible 3 The plot of Do Androids Dream is shaped by Roy Batys dreams of a better life Baty radically proposes the sacredness of socalled android life 169 a utopian notion if there ever were one The popularity of precolonial fiction among Martians and in Batys cell particularly also manifests the utopian impulse in the androids As Pris says of these stories written before space travel but about space travel 139 You can imagine what it might have been like What Mars ought to be like 140 The title of the novel poses the question of android hope and it turns out that rather than electric sheep which is more or less what Deckard shallowly dreams about androids dream of freedom Do Androids Dream takes a different route from Never Let Me Go to imagining nonhuman hope Dick is just as likely to question the foundation and character of human hope as he is to represent hope in androids Not only can mechanical androids hope but also as in the case of human empathy there turns out to be something mechanical and impoverished about human hope Isidore tells Pris that an empathy box is the most personal possession you have Its an extension of your body its the way you touch other humans its the way you stop being alone 62 When Iran wants to snap out of her feelings of despair she programs 481 into her Penfield mood organ Awareness of the manifold possibilities open to me in the future new hope that 6 Devilishly Dick demonstrates that hu man hopedreams of a better life sense of a future openness of possibilitysometimes requires mechanical supplementation This erodes the prejudice reflected by Bloch that hope is innately and uniquely human but it does so from the opposite direction of Never Let Me Go Because mechanical androids dream of a better world not only must nonhuman animals be admitted into the circle of hope but also hope itself must be demystified and dereified as essentially human Nonhuman Hope Drawing on the defamiliarizing and transformative possibilities of scifi Ishiguros and Dicks novels circumvent conventional concep tions and representations of nonhuman animal hope Because these novels are not directly about nonhuman animals they can avoid representing nonhuman hope in realist sentimental and allegorical modes For all their benefit to animal studies these traditional modes nonetheless can still reflect and maintain considerable resistances and barriers to rethinking nonhuman animal hope By looking at nonhuman animals obliquely and at arms distance even distract edly and mechanically through the minute circuitry of clones and androids these novels help readers imaginatively loosen the jealous human grip on hope They allow hope more readily to pass across species To demystify human hope as mechanically reflexive or tech nologically mediated as Dick does is similarly to erode the basis for denying socalled authentic hope to nonhuman animals David P Rando To attribute hoperather than simply futureplanning or delayed gratificationto nonhumans is to make it harder to accept the inhumane and brutal instrumental treatment of thinking and feeling fellow beings under capitalist production The form and the aim of distracted and habitual reading proposed here may seem like wishful thinking empty hope and utopian daydreaming However Bloch shows how daydreams are not only as Freud would have it idle compensatory fantasies Another part of the daydream is provocative is not content just to accept the bad which exists does not accept renunciation This other part has hoping at its core and is teachable 317 Further he writes The daydream can furnish inspirations which do not require interpreting but working out it builds castles in the air as blueprints too and not always just fictitious ones 8618 Ishiguro and Dick present provocations with hope at their core They are not content with the bad that exists nor should we be Besides concentrating on and interpreting these novels we ought also to let them inspire daydreams idle and compensatory on the one hand but possible blueprints for a better world on the other a world that rethinks and remakes the breaks between and among all animals Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep are dys topian novels that picture nightmarish parallel histories or futures However they are utopian novels as well because in Jamesons terms they allow us to think the break 232 itself or to imagine the sta tus quo disrupted Ishiguro and Dick represent nonhuman hope in unusually challenging and genredefying ways Read strategically their novels challenge the discourse of hope in ways that cut across accustomed habits and conventions for representing nonhuman animals They can help to redistribute our precious but most preju dicially parceled out hope Finally the discourse of nonhuman animal capacities is insepa rable from the question of fictions capacities Debates about animal capacities are also literary debates about what fiction can do to chal lenge and change readers minds and hearts as well as what readers can do to strategically harness fictions affordances Read through acts of deliberate critical anthropomorphism Ishiguros and Dicks novels about clones and androids help to enfranchise nonhuman animals habitually into the privilege estate and dignity of hope In this way clones and androids might help to make a better life for nonhuman animals than humans alone have so far been capable of doing I wish to thank Elena Nusloch Mellon Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow at Trinity University in 2020 for her meticulous and conscien tious assistance while researching this essay 1 I follow Bloch as treating hope as an emotion though as DeKoven David P Rando anthropomorphism and the enduring Cartesian view of animals as ma chinelike Calarco succinctly summarizes the Cartesian view Starting from mechanistic premises Descartes argues that animals although alive and capable of sensation are essentially indistinguishable from machines and that their behavior can be fully explained without recourse to notions such as mind and selfawareness Animals in his account are complex automata beings that can react to external stimuli but lack the ability to know that such reactions are taking place 9 8 Although he rejects animal studies as a field name Lundblad sug gests that the subfields that comprise it reflect different priorities with different aims or ends in mind rather than rigid distinctions without overlap 2 9 Fraiman observes Without giving a single example relying entirely on other scholars for a blanket indictment of cultural studies as incoherent and vague Wolfe blames these qualities for helping to obscure what remains a normative conception of subjectivity despite the rhetorical inclusion of animals 104 Responding to Fraiman Lundblad calls for sharper distinctions between subfields However in this study my framing aligns with Fraiman I will also use animal studies in its broad est contemporary sense to mean the sprawling multidisciplinary field known by some as animality studies or humananimal studies and not to be confused with the scientific usage meaning lab studies involving animals 90n2 10 By focusing on hope I do not minimize any other common emotions that scholars and critics have found between humans and nonhumans I mean to support these efforts against human exceptionalism and anthropodenial by focusing on overlooked hope 11 Calarco identifies three main approaches to the relationship between humans and animals identity difference and indistinctionbased 12 Humility about how much we can finally know of the experiences and inner lives of nonhuman animals is another tenet of animal studies as Waldau conceptualizes them identifying the nature of any and all limits as to what humans might know about other living beings is a key task requiring honesty constant work and liberal doses of humility 6 13 Mhire and Hernandez argue that Ishiguro finds hope in the students decency but that in a flattened world with no families no gods and no ambition hope in the future is replaced with a fondness for the past 221 Mhire and Hernandez consistently claim that Ishiguro regards Never Let Me Go as his most hopeful novel though in the interview they cite Ishiguro actually calls it my cheerful novel Ishiguro attributes this cheerfulness to the students decency I wanted to show three people who were essentially decent When they finally realize that their time is limited I wanted them not to be preoccupied with their status or their material possessions I wanted them to care most about each other and setting things right So for me it was saying positive things about human beings against the rather bleak fact of our mortality Kazuo Ishiguro 52 14 Vint writes the central role of animals in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and the issues of species being that they raise show the need to struggle for a dif ferent way of being in the world This way resists commodification in our relations with one another and with nature to produce a better future one in which humans might be fully human once again by repairing our social relations with animals and nature Speciesism and Species 125 15 Building on Vincis work Olsen discusses how the possibility of android trauma blurs the boundaries between machines and humans thus undermining anthropocentrism 102 16 Vint rightly attributes this contradiction to capitalist alienation Deck ards struggle to have a noncommodity relationship with animals and others within the novel reveals the damage that capitalist modes of rela tion have done to his subjectivity but also point given Deckards ability to change to a potential way out of such damaging social structures Speciesism and Species 120 17 According to Freud We may lay it down that a happy person never phantasies only an unsatis fied one The motive forces of phantasies are unsatisfied wishes and every single phantasy is the fulfilment of a wish a correction of unsatisfying reality These motivating wishes vary according to the sex character and circumstances of the person who is having the phantasy but they fall naturally into two main groups They are either ambitious wishes which serve to elevate the subjects personality or they are erotic ones 439 18 For Bloch nightdreams are concerned with the oedipal past and with the unconscious in which as Bloch David P Rando by Howard Eiland and

rfhhorsfieldgmailcom This article performs a close reading of the Philip K Dick novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep While developing the argument for an ironic usage of the concept of the Anthropocene This ironised conception is one that intends to countenance both the Anthropocenes strength as a designation of human impact on the nonhuman and the important valid critiques responding to the Anthropocene Philip K Dicks work in particular Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is a superb illustration of such an ironic dynamic because of the dual narrative structure present For example Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep raises questions about human identity that while metaphysical have great significance materially for the characters in the novel and can be understood as a form of structural discrimination To demonstrate this ironic duality that should be brought to the Anthropocene the article draws on Nick Lands essay Kant Capital and the Prohibition of Incest A Polemical

When thinking of Philip K Dick in relation to climate change the obvious place to start is his novel The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch Temperatures of 180C in formerly temperate zones such as New York make emigration from Earth necessary while the high capitalist society ever present in Dicks works seeks to profit from the immiserating circumstances in which the colonists find themselves via the Perky P Layouts miniature recreations of 20th century life and the communal hallucinogenic CAND The anguish of living apart from a dying Earth is a central component of the narrative in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch However while global warming underpins the novel and although one can discover motifs of ecological disaster in almost any major Dick story eg Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 An Ironic Anthropocene The epigraph chosen for this article reflects the multifaceted nature of the diagnosis implied in the Anthropocene of division A powerful criticism of the employment of the term Anthropocene is that it is far too broad and allencompassing in its implications to properly delineate a historical period in which humans have played a significant role in shaping the earths geological structure It is also potentially problematic in that it arguably obscures the specific historical political social and economic forces behind the actual changes In their persuasive chapter titled Who is the Anthropos from their book The Shock of the Anthropocene Bonneuil and Fressoz cite the example of the Yanomami Indians who hunt fish and garden in the Amazonian forest working three hours a day with no fossil fuel to ask the question should they feel responsible for the climate change of the Anthropocene Bonneuil  Fressoz 2014 70 In On the poverty of our nomenclature Eileen Crist argues that As a cohesive discourse the Anthropocene blocks alternative forms of human life on Earth from vying for attention By upholding historys forward thrust it also submits to its totalizing and in that sense spurious ideology of delivering continuous improvement By affirming the centrality of manas both causal force and subject of concernthe Anthropocene shrinks the discursive space for challenging the domination of the biosphere offering instead a technoscientific pitch for its rationalization and a pragmatic plea for resigning ourselves to its actuality Crist E 2016 25 Simultaneously given the scale and complexity of the trends we are confronted with when attempting to comprehend the trends latent in a term such as the Anthropocene and given the problem of determining exactly which force is responsible for the current ecological crisis  in the words of Donna Haraway all the thousand names are too big and too small all the stories are too big and too small Haraway 2015 160  this article will employ an ironic use of the term Anthropocene as unstable as it is in its unfolding This is also intended to reflect the unstable categories in DADES and what Quentin Samuel Miller describes as a complex and porous narrative about shifting environmental paradigms Miller 2017 4 This narrative duality or doubling of the metaphysical and the material is a dynamic I wish to bring to bear on the Anthropocene discourse The very fact that the term or discourse of the Anthropocene is contentious and viewed as an ideological palimpsest by some critics can be employed as a useful shorthand for indicating both the conventional original usage and the significant critical response Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 To help guide me through this doubling I will refer to Nick Land Land drew on Blade Runner the film adaptation of DADES for some of his most notable work in Machinic Desire and Meltdown However I will draw from Lands first short essay Kant Capital and the Prohibition of Incest A Polemical Introduction to the Configuration of Philosophy and Modernity in order to illustrate the doubled ironic Anthropocene in Dicks novel The reason for this decision comes from the startling correspondence between this essays formulation of a metaphysics of capitalist modernity via its reading of racist technologies and the political economy in DADES A further reason is that Kant Capital and the Prohibition of Incest makes its argument on philosophical and political levels a duality appropriate for reading a Philip K Dick novel Inhibited Synthesis of the Anthropocene Lands thesis in Kant Capital and the Prohibition of Incest stems from the premise that the Bantustans of Apartheid South Africa are a microcosm of capitalisms fundamental structure As Bantustans served to keep the black population at arms length from the wealthy white population they established a political distance between both whilst maintaining geographical proximity for black economic exploitation Land argues that the same relationship exists between the global metropolises and the colonial periphery Colonised peoples yield their resources and labour to capital but are excluded from the nations acquiring this wealth Land argues for this relationship by explicating the relationship between Kants conception of synthetic a priori and the theory of trade conceived by Claude LeviStrauss Kants theory of synthetic a priori knowledge is for Land the philosophical reflection of capitals accumulation of wealth the signature of an enlightenment society that wants both to learn and legislate for all time Land 2011 63 This is because synthetic a priori is a form of knowledge that is both given in advance by ourselves a priori and yet adds to what we know synthetic Ibid 64 This conceptual framework is inherently inhibitive for Land because it is a theory of knowledge that attempts to explain difference in advance and therefore to capture that difference through anticipation This reading of Kant is then applied to LeviStrauss account of rich food food given to another to consume and received from another which is food that derives its quality of richness not from its relation to class but upon a differentiation between tribes Ibid 68 The rich food is an external object given to another tribe it comes from outside Ibid 68 The rich food exchanged the primordial element of trade Ibid 69 alongside women for marriage develops a new bond of kinship one of alliance instead of filiation Ibid 68 Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 Land concludes that Kants conception of synthetic a priori knowledge is the philosophical culmination and base for the commodity By producing a synthetic a priori model for experience what is novel in the other finds itself contained Ensconced as such what is exterior to a conceptual system is anticipated processed by that anticipation and thus primed for commodification the rich food can be taken without the risk of marriage This per capitalisms function includes people with their labour and gives formal structure to the conception of a Bantustan relationship between the metropolis and the periphery A persons labour as a commodity is taken in the trade  economic proximity  but the accompanying marriage or cultural exchange is kept at a political distance In this tensile relationship which Land terms inhibited synthesis  which can be awkwardly described as patriarchal neocolonial capital accumulation Land 2011 63 capitalist modernity is caught in an intractable contradiction wherein its need for profit fuels an infinite requirement for the other which it is politically unable to imbibe What generates the contradiction in inhibited synthesis is what Land calls exogamic dissipation  extending Strauss intertribal exchange via marriage to the cultural exchange  or the dissolution of patriarchal cultural and ethnic identities through the continuous engagement people must have with those outside their traditional ties of kinship such as those inculcated by a nationality A limited example of this occurred with the emergence of the urban proletariat in the wake of the industrial revolution when those who were forced into the cities for work encountered each other became conscious of their commonality and began to agitate for their own interests Land proposes something larger and more radical a global explosion in the potentiality of exogamic marriages alongside the trade as conceptualized by LeviStrauss Such a global dissipation of identities and traditional bonds of kinship would also dissolve capitalism This global dissipation of the old patriarchal and provincial structures would generate a universal fraternal and horizontal kinship that could not tolerate exploitation On this basis capitalist modernity exhibits protofascist traits Land argues because it is constantly flirting with its own extinction Capitalist modernity enacts policies and builds infrastructures such as the Bantustan in order to keep kinship and trade systematically isolated from each other Ibid 62 Borders in the Anthropocene Neocolonialist capitalism has consistently employed brutal immigration policies and racist practices both within and outside of western countries in order to perpetuate the synthetic inhibition but it has done so with zones permitting the free movement of labour  the most prominent and formal of these being the European Unions Schengen Area bounded by Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 Fortress Europe a concept used to describe the complex of securitised immigration policies towards those who seek to cross the European Unions external borders especially its southern one Pinos 2009 3 This system has been described as a means to filter out and exclude the discomforting other that is to say the outsiders who challenge the EUs borders of comfort italicised for emphasis Ibid 4 Additionally the nationalist renaissance across Europe and North America especially with its emphasis on border control presents an intensification of the inhibitive process as those countries attempt to reverse the forces that are eroding the privileges of their bourgeois classes at both the geopolitical and socioeconomic levels In his 2016 review of Martin Heideggers black notebooks Malcolm Bull introduces Branko Milanovićs concept of citizenship rentthe increased income you get from doing the same job in one country rather than the otherin order to make the following comments At a time when the longheralded decline of the West is finally becoming an objective reality the lower middle class of the rich world stands in an ambiguous position Geography still counts for almost everything But if these trends continue citizenship rents will decline further and citizenship itself will be devalued as an asset What makes the current moment unique is that the ontological decline of the West has fallen into step with the decline in income differentials and attachment to place isnt just a matter of becoming indigenous and making yourself at home in the world but of stubborn attachment to a particular position in the global economic order Bull 2016 i Bull gives an account for a neocolonial order that is attempting to reassert itself through a reaffirmation of xenophobic identity in order to maintain economic preeminence Without recourse to reorganizing the worlds resources for a more equitable distribution of wealth capitalism and populations turn to a state of vicious retreat behind border walls The forces behind the inhibition of synthesis reassert themselves through strengthened technologies of racism What makes for a bleaker future is that there is every indication that the climatic and ecological deprivations associated with the Anthropocene will exacerbate this fundamental situation As many parts of the world follow a trajectory towards the uninhabitable as farming yields decline and as land and nations shrink or even disappear the far right nationalist rhetoric of blood and soil becomes very literal because climate change isnt just about things getting hotter and wetter under our current economic and political model its about things getting meaner and uglier Klein 2016 At the time of writing this article the UN does not legally recognise climate change as a qualifying criterion for refugee status and there is therefore Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 no formal legal protection for these affected people Beeler 2018 The arguments specifically put forward against offering legal protection include the fears of aggravating preexisting chauvinist sentiments making things worse for the very people the refugee convention aims to protect Ibid This reluctance to afford the climate migrant refugee status contains a tacit acknowledgement by the system of nationstates manifested in the UN of the political potential of mass migration especially when considering the numbers of people who will be dislodged by the climate crisis a billion per degree of temperature increase Seaton 2020 48 The disruption those fleeing pose to the infrastructure of synthetic inhibition  of borders formal nationalities and the accompanying security systems  has the potential to overwhelm it rending apart the international infrastructure of borders capital still depends upon effectively dissolving them by making encounters between peoples and their others unavoidable Fleeing the Bantustan destroys it This synthesis must be resisted at any cost for capitalist modernity to survive Antiimmigrant policies and the refusal to coordinate a comprehensive rescue policy between European countries for example has meant that the chance of death for a person crossing the Mediterranean between January and July 2018 was 1 in 18 Crisp 2018 A list compiled by UNITED recorded the death toll of people trying to cross the Mediterranean and enter Europe between the 1st January 1993 and the 5th May 2018 at 34361 UNITED 2018 Simultaneously such a large and systematic human cost requires a hierarchy of racial worth A hierarchy that I argue inhabits DADES Reading Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep When looking to understand the ideology within DADES the passage most useful to gain an insight into its worlds political economy is the brief explosive portion of an advertisement the character J R Isidore listens to as he shaves The TV set shouted  duplicates the halcyon days of the preCivil War Southern states Either as body servants or tireless field hands the custom tailored humanoid robot  designed specifically for YOUR UNIQUE NEEDS FOR YOU AND YOU ALONE  given to you on your arrival absolutely free equipped fully as specified by you before your departure from Earth this loyal troublefree companion in the greatest boldest adventure contrived by man in history will provide it continued on and on Dick 1997 18 Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 This Isidore informs the reader is part of a propaganda push from the Washingtonrun space colonisation program the chief economic drive in World War Terminus nuclear wake It is the promise of an organic android to fulfil YOUR UNIQUE NEEDS the you being a human a citizen of earth meeting the novels UNs criteria for humanity your unique needs which encompasses not just physical needs but emotional and symbolic A few lines down the government propaganda features an interview with a recent immigrant to Mars and she is asked Mrs Klugman how would you contrast your life back on contaminated earth with your new life here in a world rich with every imaginable possibility Dick 1997 18 Klugman answers I think what I and my family of three noticed most was the dignity The dignity Mrs Klugman the announcer asked Yes Mrs Klugman now of New New York Mars said Its a hard thing to explain Having a servant you can depend on in these troubled times I find it reassuring Dick 1997 1819 Mrs Krugmans soft short sentences Krugman has three sentences compared to the direct advertisements two her hesitation and the vagueness in her answer of reassurance complements the first part of the hysterical shouted propaganda Whereas the official pronouncement is explicit in its hyperbolic description of the androids utility Mrs Krugmans vagueness makes a sentimental appeal and gestures to the fantastical dimension of owning sentient labour The kernel of the propaganda and advertising for the driver of the greatest boldest adventure contrived by manthe androidincludes a selfcomparison to the chattel slavery of nineteenth century America What raises the passage from a crude comparison between sentient mechanical labour and slavery however is Dicks apparently heavy handed allusions to the latter which on first reading can be dismissed as crude commentary The propaganda is at pains to make an explicit comparison between the organic androids and slaves of the Antebellum South Because the comparison is diegetic an extra dimension comes into play The androids physical labour is not the sole source of the androids appeal as a commodity The experience of slaveowning itself is commoditised and standardised sold as an essential aspect of human individuality The white supremacist pastoral of the Antebellum prewar cathects the memory of a prewar earth The individual is recentered YOU as the focal point of economic expansion and activity in the wake of the destruction caused by the capitalist civilization that generated the same project of hyperindividuality This recentering is a buttressing of a specific identity of an anthropocentric identity that merges totally with a bourgeois identity Dicks material grounding of DADES in relation to a Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 specific period of American history enables an interpretation of the novel in the context of the Anthropocene and a distinctly selfconscious Eurocentric anthropocentrism This anthropocentrism derives from a desire to preserve and strictly regulate a human identity in order to maintain social cohesion for a new economic project that intends to recapture that Eurocentrism There are two discrete geographical zones in Do Androids Dream Earth and the colonies each of distinct significance Despite Earths devastation and despite the economic momentum being with the colonies organic androids are restricted by law from

on a low salary and a commissionbased retirement bonus Earths remaining civilian population is unaware of the extent to which androids are pursued and murdered on earth because says Pris Stratton you people arent supposed to know Dick 1997 113 I think Isidore said youre mistaken Never in his life had he heard of such a thing Buster Friendly for instance had never mentioned it ts not in accord with presentday Mercerian ethics he pointed out Dick 1997 113 Isidore lives in a civilization formally recognising after World War Terminus all conventional terrestrial life as sacred However this does not constitute a bulwark against destructive economic or capitalist tendencies As he does with the Anthropocene avant la letter Philip K Dick depicts an Eremocene the age of human loneliness in a time of mass extinction coined by EO Wilson Wilson E O 2013 in DADES It does not present the spectre of ecological loneliness as a catalyst for the discontinuation of capitalism or domination but as a vehicle for a penetrating fetishising commodification Its apogee is the monthly Sidneys Catalogue pricing every animal according to its scarcity and the integration of this pricing into social relations Deckard is motivated in his work by the hope of owning a living organic animal like his peers In the Freudian sense of the word fetish animal life becomes a substitute mediating the affirmation of anthropocentrism and bourgeois patriarchal values Abortion is an offence punishable by death and there exists a class of people officially known as special within which there are subcategories of intellectual disability pejoratively referred to as chickenheads and antheads Isidore himself is a chickenhead Those who are special are the most affected by the environmental effects of radiation and forbidden to leave Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 much like those who are most affected by the policies of capitalist imperialist countries are those who face the largest obstacles to their escape Subjected to the hierarchy of human identity they are unsuitable for the novels UN colonization project While the crumbs of surviving nature are transformed into fetishised objects Dick imagines the remains of abandoned human habitations assuming natures role as the source of the negative and uncanny Isidore senses this energy named Kipple keenly throughout the novel From the useless pole lamp in the living room it oozed out meshing with the empty and wordless descent of itself from the flyspecked ceiling It managed in fact to emerge from every object within his range of vision as if it  the silence  meant to supplant all things tangible Dick 1997 20 Kipple is the name for the cumulative entropic presence of consumer goods abandoned after the mass migration from Earth presenting an oppressive weight and stripped of their utility unmoored by human depopulation It complements the destabilization of anthropocentrism brought about by the increasingly sophisticated androids in a manner eluding the techniques of android policing It is telling that this most acute description of Kipples effect comes from Isidore immediately after he turns off the TV screaming the advertisement for androids Kipple is in fact the reason Isidore turns on the TV in the first place The collective experience of Mercerism seems to have come from a move to counter that destabilization although the Mercerian hoax is of unknown origin Ibid 158 I didnt think it was true he said full of relief Why didnt you She swivelled to stare intently at him Bbbecause things like that dont happen The gggovernment never kills anyone for any crime And Mercerism  But you see Pris said if youre not human then its all different Dick 1997 122 Mercerian ethics by which empathy becomes an official institution and bulwark of the human species correspond with corporate and UN intentions to perpetuate the political economy of slavery by operating across both sociopolitical and metaphysicalontological narratives Mercers appearance outside of the empathy boxes to Deckard late in the novel do seem to contradict Buster Friendlys debunking However the appearance presents itself as an ideological validation of his bounty hunting job and social role Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 Am I outside Mercerism now Rick said As the chickenhead said Because of what Im going to do in the next few minutes Mercer said Mr Isidore spoke for himself not for me What you are doing has to be done Dick 1997 166 Mercer offers no explanation for why the retirements must take place beyond tautology but if Mercers conversation with Isidore is any indication Mercers position is fatalistic and permissive The only positive action Mercer takes in his appearance to Deckard is to warn him of Pris Dick 1997 166 It is here that Mercerian ethics and the accompanying empathy industry aligns most explicitly with their counterpart the Voigt Kampff test as technologies of racism Further Mercers empathy box experience is not only the prime example of doubling in the novel but also comes closest to the double rendition of Kantian subjectivity Land describes The Mercerian phenomenon as illustrated above allows for an experience of alterity that is circumscribed through ritual and its predetermined end However when Deckard and Isidore encounter the androids personally they must confront the ambiguity of the other themselves Deckard as Race Scientist Regardless of his personal doubts as to the business of retiring androids Deckard in his professional capacity is only troubled not compromised when it concerns his sexual interest Rachael Rosen and his aesthetic tastes Luba Lufts singing not because he considers androids beings who warrant care Like bourgeois ideation concerning immigrants Deckards valuation of androids is predicated on their usevalue or their capacity to disrupt Nevertheless Deckard is disturbed by his encounters with the other His relationships with the androids especially with Rachael chime with Lands assessment of modernitys appropriative movements a profound but uneasy relation to an outside that both attracts and repels it Land 2011 64 Consider Deckards perspective on android retirement As violent and graphic as the following passages are and despite the deliberately inconsistent deployment of pronouns they contain no details about each androids viscera or tissue the 38 magnum slug struck the android in the head and its brain box burst The Nexus6 unit which operated it blew into pieces a raging mad wind which carried throughout the car Dick 1997 73 The laser beam aimed with skill bifurcated Inspector Garlands head He slumped forward the corpse teetered on its chair and then like a sack of eggs it slid to one side and crashed to the floor Ibid 96 Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 The beam missed its mark but as Resch lowered it burrowed a narrow hole silently into her stomach She began to scream Like the picture Rick thought to himself and with his own laser tube killed her Luba Lufts body fell forward face down in a heap It did not even tremble Ibid 103 He fired at her as imploringly she dashed toward him The android burst and parts of it flewIm sorry Mrs Baty Rick said and shot her Ibid 168 He shot Roy Baty the big mans corpse lashed about toppled like an overstacked collection of separate brittle entities Ibid 168 Aside from the mentions of reflex circuits and brain boxes Deckard fails to describe the entrails and the reader only receives Isidores perspective of the corpses secondhand through Deckard This is strange although the androids physiognomy differs from a humans it is not simply the case that androids are composed of materials corresponding to reallife robotics The alternative to the VoigtKampf test is the Boneli test consisting of a bone marrow analysis by which a persons humanity can be organically determined Ibid 43 suggesting that the androids tissue is near identical to a humans This is before the other utility of an android  sex  is considered Phil Resch and Deckard both have sex with androids and Resch reports the commonplace practice of illegal android mistresses on the colonies telling Deckard sure its illegal but people do it anyhow Ibid 110 Androids are for the most part physiologically human Deckards perception and selfnarrativising of his social function as a bounty hunter reflects his troubled disavowal Nevertheless the androids do differ from humans For Isidore the androids Pris Irmgard and Roy seem strange As if a peculiar and malign abstractness pervaded their mental processes Ibid 119 However the novel leaves open the question of whether this malignity is innate to the androids or relational The VoigtKampf test demonstrates uncanny accuracy in distinguishing androids from humans by measuring empathy By measuring physical responses to questions othering becomes a technological practice even when the questions themselves are explicitly absurd and steeped in the civilizations social mores Humans are sufficiently standardized in their fetishization of preandroid life that the VoigtKampf test can be applied to anyone with the same decisive result Garlands observation to Rick that Its a chance anyway breaking free and coming here to Earth where were not even considered animals Where every worm and wood louse is considered more desirable than us put together Dick 1997 94 Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 does not go far enough animal life as a commodity literally constitutes the metric that determines whether extrainstrumental androids are executed Empathy is just a way of proving something that humans can do based on the humans word Ibid 158 Fetishised as such empathy becomes a form of scientific racism repurposed to deny the androids sovereignty as citizens and denies their right to free movement The androids have no option but violence to escape their slavery He doesnt understand yet Pris said in a sharp brittle stentorian voice how we got off Mars What we did there What we couldnt help doing Roy Baty grunted Ibid 124 The political economy of Dicks world bears striking similarities to the current climateaccelerated political economy of ours In addition to the simple fact that the androids like migrants are valued significantly less than charismatic megafauna the android when escaping their enslavement and entering Earth much like a person escaping to a country of the global North dissolves their clear identity as an unperson They are visible as a sapient feeling being They enter the liminal space on the lip of Lands synthesis Insofar as they impersonate a recognizable role Garland or Luft for example the android assumes citizenship of Earth plausible to their fellow person This to recapitulate is why I argue that people migrating to the global North are resisted most violently at the point of crossing the border Equally Land himself argued in his conclusion to Kant Capital and the Prohibition of Incest that a revolutionary war can only be fought in hell as the state apparatus of an advanced industrial society can certainly not be defeated without a willingness to escalate the cycle of violence without limit Land 2011 79 for this very reason Land envisages the ascension of feminine ie nonpatriarchal amazons to overthrow the capitalist reality and destroy the inhibition The android neatly assumes this role as its figure presents the uncontrollable eruption of feminine ie migrant alterity into the fathers heartland Ibid 62 Conclusion As is true in many of Philip K Dicks stories what happens to how the characters think about the world in DADES as opposed to the changes in the world itself assumes more importance to the narrative Despite the arrival of android amazons no revolution arrives at the end of the novel an exhausted Deckard returns to his wife after a long day of work Isidore shrinks miserably away under the shadow of Kipple Isidores lack of understanding and his distress as he watches the androids torture the spider spring from his strict adherence to Mercerian and UN orthodoxy Exchanges The Interdisciplinary Research Journal Horsfield Exchanges 2021 82 pp 8498 allows him to appreciate the androids as people a priori Because he honestly believes the anthropocentric dogma he can move beyond its ideological entrapment into a new modernity The androids would kill the spider and Deckard would disdain it because of its low status in the animal hierarchy Isidore wishes to care for it and keep it The Anthropocene as a term and discursive project instead of being discarded should be retained also with the intention that its universalizing project develops a new ecological and human kinship a new synthesis The nurturing societies are tasked with ensuring the Anthropocenes continuation whether they move to a postcapitalist future or not Robert is a graduate of the University of Warwick the

Anneke who endured commented and sup ported me throughout the process all my love as ever Introduction Not all of us can say with any degree of certainty that we have always been human or that we are only that Some of us are not even considered fully human now let alone at previous moments of Western social political and scientiﬁ c history Not if by human we mean that creature familiar to us from the Enlightenment and its legacy The Cartesian subject of the cogito the Kantian community of reasonable beings or in more sociological terms the subject as citizen rightsholder propertyowner and so on Wolfe 2010a And yet the term enjoys widespread consensus and it main tains the reassuring familiarity of common sense We assert our attachment to the species as if it were a matter of fact a given So much so that we construct a fundamental notion of Rights around the Human But is it so While conservative religious social forces today often labour to reinscribe the human within a paradigm of natural law the concept of the human has exploded under the double pressure of contemporary scientiﬁ c advances and global eco nomic concerns After the postmodern the postcolonial the postindustrial the postcommunist and even the much con tested postfeminist conditions we seem to have entered the posthuman predicament Far from being the nth variation in a sequence of preﬁ xes that may appear both endless and somehow arbitrary the posthuman condition introduces a unit of common reference for our species our polity and our relationship to the other inhabitants of this planet This issue raises serious questions as to the very structures of our shared identity  as humans  amidst the complexity of contemporary science politics and international relations Discourses and representations of the nonhuman the inhuman the anti human the inhumane and the posthuman proliferate and overlap in our globalized technologically mediated societies The debates in mainstream culture range from hardnosed business discussions of robotics prosthetic technologies neu roscience and biogenetic capital to fuzzier new age visions of transhumanism and technotranscendence Human enhance ment is at the core of these debates In academic culture on the other hand the posthuman is alternatively celebrated as the next frontier in critical and cultural theory or shunned as the latest in a series of annoying post fads The posthuman pro vokes elation but also anxiety Habermas 2003 about the possibility of a serious decentring of Man the former measure of all things There is widespread concern about the loss of relevance and mastery suffered by the dominant vision of the human subject and by the ﬁ eld of scholarship centred on it namely the Humanities In my view the common denominator for the posthuman condition is an assumption about the vital selforganizing and yet nonnaturalistic structure of living matter itself This natureculture continuum is the shared starting point for my take on posthuman theory Whether this postnaturalistic assumption subsequently results in playful experimentations with the boundaries of perfectibility of the body in moral panic about the disruption of centuriesold beliefs about human nature or in exploitative and proﬁ tminded pursuit of genetic and neural capital remains however to be seen In this book I will try to examine these approaches and engage critically with them while arguing my case for posthuman subjectivity What does this natureculture continuum amount to It marks a scientiﬁ c paradigm that takes its distance from the social constructivist approach which has enjoyed widespread consensus This approach posits a categorical distinction between the given nature and the constructed culture The distinction allows for a sharper focus in social analysis and it Introduction mechanisms that support the construction of key identities institutions and practices In progressive politics social con structivist methods sustain the efforts to denaturalize social differences and thus show their manmade and historically contingent structure Just think of the worldchanging effect of Simone de Beauvoirs statement that one is not born one becomes a woman This insight into the socially bound and therefore historically variable nature of social inequalities paves the road to their resolution by human intervention through social policy and activism My point is that this approach which rests on the binary opposition between the given and the constructed is currently being replaced by a nondualistic understanding of nature culture interaction In my view the latter is associated to and supported by a monistic philosophy which rejects dualism especially the opposition natureculture and stresses instead the selforganizing or autopoietic force of living matter The boundaries between the categories of the natural and the cul tural have been displaced and to a large extent blurred by the effects of scientiﬁ c and technological advances This book starts from the assumption that social theory needs to take stock of the transformation of concepts methods and political practices brought about by this change of paradigm Con versely the question of what kind of political analysis and which progressive politics is supported by the approach based on the natureculture continuum is central to the agenda of the posthuman predicament The main questions I want to address in this book are ﬁ rstly what is the posthuman More speciﬁ cally what are the intellectual and historical itineraries that may lead us to the posthuman Secondly where does the posthuman condition leave humanity More speciﬁ cally what new forms of sub jectivity are supported by the posthuman Thirdly how does the posthuman engender its own forms of inhumanity More speciﬁ cally how might we resist the inhumane aspects of our era And last how does the posthuman affect the practice of the Humanities today More speciﬁ cally what is the func tion of theory in posthuman times This book rides the wave of simultaneous fascination for the posthuman condition as a crucial aspect of our historicity but also of concern for its aberrations its abuses of power and the sustainability of some of its basic premises Part of the fascina tion is due to my sense of what the task of critical theorists should be in the world today namely to provide adequate representations of our situated historical location This in itself humble cartographic aim that is connected to the ideal of producing socially relevant knowledge ﬂ ips over into a more ambitious and abstract question namely the status and value of theory itself Several cultural critics have commented on the ambivalent nature of the posttheoretical malaise that has struck the contemporary Human and Social Sciences For instance Tom Cohen Claire Colebrook and J Hillis Miller 2012 emphasize the positive aspect of this posttheory phase namely the fact that it actually registers the new opportunities as well as the threats that emerge from contemporary science The negative aspects however are just as striking notably the lack of suit able critical schemes to scrutinize the present I think that the antitheory shift is linked to the vicissitudes of the ideological context After the ofﬁ cial end of the Cold War the political movements of the second half of the twentieth century have been discarded and their theoretical efforts dis missed as failed historical experiments The new ideology of the free market economy has steamrolled all oppositions in spite of massive protest from many sectors of society imposing antiintellectualism as a salient feature of our times This is especially hard on the Humanities because it penalizes subtlety of analysis by paying undue allegiance to common sense  the tyranny of doxa  and to economic proﬁ t  the banality of selfinterest In this context theory has lost status and is often dismissed as a form of fantasy or narcissistic selfindulgence Consequently a shallow version of neoempiricism  which is often nothing more than datamining  has become the meth odological norm in Humanities research The question of method deserves serious consideration after the ofﬁ cial end of ideologies and in view of the advances in neural evolutionary and biogenetic sciences can we still hold the powers of theoretical interpretation in the same esteem they have enjoyed since the end of the Second World War Is the posthuman predicament not also linked to a posttheory mood For instance Bruno Latour 2004  not exactly a classical Introduction produced by networks of human and nonhuman actors things and objects  recently commented on the tradition of critical theory and its connection to European humanism Critical thought rests on a social constructivist paradigm which intrin sically proclaims faith in theory as a tool to apprehend and represent reality but is such faith still legitimate today Latour raised serious selfquestioning doubts about the function of theory today There is an undeniably gloomy connotation to the posthu man condition especially in relation to genealogies of critical thought It is as if after the great explosion of theoretical cre ativity of the 1970s and 1980s we had entered a zombiﬁ ed landscape of repetition without difference and lingering mel ancholia A spectral dimension has seeped into our patterns of thinking boosted on the right of the political spectrum by ideas about the end of ideological time Fukuyama 1989 and the inevitability of civilizational crusades Huntington 1996 On the political left on the other hand the rejection of theory has resulted in a wave of resentment and negative thought against the previous intellectual generations In this context of theoryfatigue neocommunist intellectuals Badiou and Žižek 2009 have argued for the need to return to concrete political action even violent antagonism if necessary rather than indulge in more theoretical speculations They have contributed to push the philosophical theories of poststructuralism way out of fashion In response to this generally negative social climate I want to approach posthuman theory as both a genealogical and a navigational tool I ﬁ nd it useful as a term to explore ways of engaging afﬁ rmatively with the present accounting for some of its features in a manner that is empirically grounded without being reductive and remains critical while avoiding negativity I want to map out some of the ways in which the posthuman is circulating as a dominant term in our globally linked and technologically mediated societies More speciﬁ cally posthu man theory is a generative tool to help us rethink the basic unit of reference for the human in the biogenetic age known as anthropocene the historical moment when the Human has become a geological force capable of affecting all life on this planet By extension it can also help us rethink the basic tenets of our interaction with both human and nonhuman agents on a planetary scale Let me give some examples of the contradictions offered by our posthuman historical condition Vignette 1 In November 2007 PekkaEric Auvinen an eighteenyearold Finnish boy opened ﬁ re on his classmates in a high school near Helsinki killing eight people before shooting himself Prior to the carnage the young killer posted a video on YouTube in which he showed himself wearing a tshirt with the caption Humanity is overrated That humanity be in a critical condition  some may even say approaching extinction  has been a leitmotif in European philosophy ever since Friedrich Nietzsche proclaimed the death of God and of the idea of Man that was built upon it This bombastic assertion was meant to drive home a more modest point What Nietzsche asserted was the end of the selfevident status attributed to human nature as the common sense belief in the metaphysically stable and universal validity of the European humanistic subject Nietzschean genealogy stresses the importance of interpretation over dogmatic implementation of natural laws and values Ever since then the main items on the philosophical agenda have been ﬁ rstly how to develop critical thought after the shock of recogni tion of a state of ontological uncertainty and secondly how to reconstitute a sense of community held together by afﬁ nity and ethical accountability without falling into the negative passions of doubt and suspicion As the Finnish episode points out however philosophical antihumanism must not be confused with cynical and nihil istic misanthropy Humanity may well be overrated but as the human population on earth reaches its eighth billion mark any talk of extinction seems downright silly And yet the issue of both ecological and social sustainability is at the top of most governmental programmes across the world in view of the environmental crisis and climate change Thus the question Bertrand Russell formulated in 1963 at the height of the Cold War and of nuclear confrontation sounds more relevant than ever has Man a future indeed Does Introduction horizon of our shared future or are there other options The issue of the limits of both humanism and of its anti humanist critics is therefore central to the debate on the posthuman predicament and I will accordingly devote the ﬁ rst chapter to it Vignette 2 The Guardian reported that people in wartorn lands like Afghanistan were reduced to eating grass in order to survive1 At the same point in history cows in the United Kingdom and parts of the European Union were fed meatbased fodder The agricultural biotechnological sector of the overdevel oped world had taken an unexpected cannibalistic turn by fattening cows sheep and chickens on animal feed This action was later diagnosed as the source for the lethal disease Bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE vulgarly called mad cow disease which caused the brain structure of the animals to corrode and turn to pulp The madness here however is decidedly on the side of the humans and their biotechnological industries Advanced capitalism and its biogenetic technologies engender a perverse form of the posthuman At its core there is a radical disruption of the humananimal interaction but all living species are caught in the spinning machine of the global economy The genetic code of living matter  Life itself Rose 2007  is the main capital Globalization means the commercialization of planet Earth in all its forms through a series of interrelated modes of appropriation According to Haraway these are the technomilitary proliferation of micro conﬂ icts on a global scale the hypercapitalist accumulation of wealth the turning of the ecosystem into a planetary appa ratus of production and the global infotainment apparatus of the new multimedia environment The phenomenon of Dolly the sheep is emblematic of the complications engendered by the biogenetic structure of con temporary technologies and their stockmarket backers Animals provide living material for scientiﬁ c experiments 1 The Guardian Weekly 35 January 2002 p 2 They are manipulated mistreated tortured and genetically recombined in ways that are productive for our biotechno logical agriculture the cosmetics industry drugs and phar maceutical industries and other sectors of the economy Animals are also sold as exotic commodities and constitute the third largest illegal trade in the world today after drugs and arms but ahead of women Mice sheep goats cattle pigs rabbits birds poultry and cats are bred in industrial farming locked up in batterycage production units As George Orwell prophetically put it however all animals may be equal but some are deﬁ nitely more equal than others Thus because they are an integral part of the biotechnological industrial complex livestock in the European Union receives subsidy to the tune of US803 per cow This is considerably less than the US1057 that is granted to each American cow and US2555 given to each cow in Japan These ﬁ gures look all the more ominous when compared to the gross national income per capita in countries like Ethiopia US120 Bangladesh US360 Angola US660 or Honduras US9202 The counterpart of this global commodiﬁ cation of living organisms is that animals have become partly humanized themselves In the ﬁ eld of bioethics for instance the issue of the human rights of animals has been raised as a way of countering these excesses The defence of animals rights is a hot political issue in most liberal democracies This combina tion of investments and abuse is the paradoxical posthuman condition engendered by advanced capitalism itself which trig gers multiple forms of resistance I will discuss the new post anthropocentric views of animals at length in chapter 2 Vignette 3 On 10 October 2011 Muammar Gaddaﬁ  deposed leader of Libya was captured in his hometown of Sirte beaten and killed by members of the National Transitional Council of Libya NTC

body less atten tion was paid to what can only described as the posthuman aspect of contemporary warfare the telethanatological machines created by our own advanced technology The atrocity of Gaddaﬁ s end  his own tyrannical despotism notwithstanding  was enough to make one feel slightly ashamed of being human The denial of the role played by the advanced worlds sophisticated deathtechnology of drones in his demise however added an extra layer of moral and political discomfort The posthuman predicament has more than its fair share of inhumane moments The brutality of the new wars in a globalized world run by the governance of fear refers not only to the government of the living but also to multiple practices of dying especially in countries in transition Bio power and necropolitics are two sides of the same coin as Mbembe 2003 brilliantly argues The postCold War world has seen not only a dramatic increase in warfare but also a profound transformation of the practice of war as such in the direction of a more complex management of survival and of extinction Contemporary deathtechnologies are posthuman because of the intense technological mediation within which they operate Can the digital operator that ﬂ ew the American Predator Drone from a computer room in Las Vegas be con sidered a pilot How does he differ from the Air Force boys who ﬂ ew the Enola Gay plane over Hiroshima and Nagasaki Contemporary wars have heightened our necropolitical power to a new level of administration of the material destruction of human bodies and population Mbembe 2003 19 And not

1992 As a result of this state of insecurity the socially enforced aim is not change but con servation or survival I shall return to these necropolitical aspects in chapter 3 Vignette 4 At a scientiﬁ c meeting organized by the Dutch Royal Academy of Sciences about the future of the academic ﬁ eld of the Humanities a few years ago a professor in Cognitive Sciences attacked the Humanities headon His attacks rested on what he perceived as the two major shortcomings of the Humani ties their intrinsic anthropocentrism and their methodologi cal nationalism The distinguished researcher found these two ﬂ aws to be fatal for the ﬁ eld which was deemed unsuitable for contemporary science and hence not eligible for ﬁ nancial support by the relevant Ministry and the government The crisis of the human and its posthuman fallout has dire consequences for the academic ﬁ eld most closely associated with it  the Humanities In the neoliberal social climate of most advanced democracies today Humanistic studies have been downgraded beyond the soft sciences level to some thing like a ﬁ nishing school for the leisurely classes Consid ered more of a personal hobby than a professional research ﬁ eld I believe that the Humanities are in serious danger of disappearing from the twentyﬁ rstcentury European univer sity curriculum Another motivation behind my engagement with the topic of the posthuman therefore can be related to a profound sense of civic responsibility for the role of the academic today A thinker from the Humanities a ﬁ gure who used to be known as an intellectual may be at a loss to know what role to play in contemporary social public scenarios One could say that my interest in the posthuman emerges from an all too human concern about the kind of knowledge and intellectual values Introduction we are producing as a society today More speciﬁ cally I worry about the status of university research in what we are still calling for lack of a better word the human sciences or the Humanities I will develop my ideas about the university today in chapter 4 This sense of responsibility also expresses a habit of thought which is dear to my heart and mind as I belong to a generation that had a dream It was and still is the dream of actually constituting communities of learning schools universities books and curricula debating societies theatre radio televi sion and media programmes  and later websites and computer environments  that look like the society they both reﬂ ect serve and help to construct It is the dream of producing socially relevant knowledge that is attuned to basic principles of social justice the respect for human decency and diversity the rejection of false universalisms the afﬁ rmation of the posi tivity of difference the principles of academic freedom anti racism openness to others and conviviality Although I am inclined towards antihumanism I have no difﬁ culty in recog nizing that these ideals are perfectly compatible with the best humanist values This book is not about taking sides in aca demic disputes but rather aims to make sense of the complexi ties we ﬁ nd ourselves in I will propose new ways of combining critique with creativity putting the active back into activism thus moving towards a vision of posthuman humanity for the global era Posthuman knowledge  and the knowing subjects that sustain it  enacts a fundamental aspiration to principles of community bonding while avoiding the twin pitfalls of con servative nostalgia and neoliberal euphoria This book is motivated by my belief in new generations of knowing sub jects who afﬁ rm a constructive type of panhumanity by working hard to free us from the provincialism of the mind the sectarianism of ideologies the dishonesty of grandiose posturing and the grip of fear This aspiration also shapes my vision of what a university should look like  a universum that serves the world of today not only as the epistemological site of scientiﬁ c production but also as the epistemophilic yearning for the empowerment that comes with knowledge and sustains our subjectivity I would deﬁ ne this yearning as a radical aspiration to freedom through the understanding of the speciﬁ c conditions and relations of power that are immi nent to our historical locations These conditions include the power that each and every one of us exercises in the everyday network of social relations at both the micro and macro political levels In some ways my interest in the posthuman is directly proportional to the sense of frustration I feel about the human all too human resources and limitations that frame our collective and personal levels of intensity and creativity This is why the issue of subjectivity is so central to this book we need to devise new social ethical and discursive schemes of subject formation to match the profound transformations we are undergoing That means that we need to learn to think differently about ourselves I take the posthuman predicament as an opportunity to empower the pursuit of alternative schemes of thought knowledge and selfrepresentation The posthuman condition urges us to think critically and creatively about who and what we are actually in the process of becoming Chapter 1 PostHumanism Life beyond the Self At the start of it all there is He the classical ideal of Man formulated ﬁ rst by Protagoras as the measure of all things later renewed in the Italian Renaissance as a universal model and represented in Leonardo da Vincis Vitruvian Man see ﬁ gure 11 An ideal of bodily perfection which in keeping with the classical dictum mens sana in corpore sano doubles up as a set of mental discursive and spiritual values Together they uphold a speciﬁ c view of what is human about human ity Moreover they assert with unshakable certainty the almost boundless capacity of humans to pursue their indi vidual and collective perfectibility That iconic image is the emblem of Humanism as a doctrine that combines the bio logical discursive and moral expansion of human capabilities into an idea of teleologically ordained rational progress Faith in the unique selfregulating and intrinsically moral powers of human reason forms an integral part of this highhumanistic creed which was essentially predicated on eighteenth and nineteenthcentury renditions of classical Antiquity and Italian Renaissance ideals This model sets standards not only for individuals but also for their cultures Humanism historically developed into a civilizational model which shaped a certain idea of Europe as coinciding with the universalizing powers of self reﬂ exive reason The mutation of the Humanistic ideal into PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Figure 11 Vitruvian Man 1492 Leonardo da Vinci Source Wikimedia Commons a hegemonic cultural model was canonized by Hegels phi losophy of history This selfaggrandizing vision assumes that Europe is not just a geopolitical location but rather a uni versal attribute of the human mind that can lend its quality to any suitable object This is the view espoused by Edmund Husserl 1970 is his celebrated essay The crisis of European PostHumanism Life beyond the Self sciences which is a passionate defence of the universal powers of reason against the intellectual and moral decline symbolized by the rising threat of European fascism in the 1930s In Husserls view Europe announces itself as the site of origin of critical reason and selfreﬂ exivity both qualities resting on the Humanistic norm Equal only to itself Europe as universal consciousness transcends its speciﬁ city or rather posits the power of transcendence as its distinctive character istic and humanistic universalism as its particularity This makes Eurocentrism into more than just a contingent matter of attitude it is a structural element of our cultural practice which is also embedded in both theory and institutional and pedagogical practices As a civilizational ideal Humanism fuelled the imperial destinies of nineteenthcentury Germany France and supremely Great Britain Davies 1997 23 This Eurocentric paradigm implies the dialectics of self and other and the binary logic of identity and otherness as respec tively the motor for and the cultural logic of universal Human ism Central to this universalistic posture and its binary logic is the notion of difference as pejoration Subjectivity is equated with consciousness universal rationality and self regulating ethical behaviour whereas Otherness is deﬁ ned as its negative and specular counterpart In so far as difference spells inferiority it acquires both essentialist and lethal con notations for people who get branded as others These are the sexualized racialized and naturalized others who are reduced to the less than human status of disposable bodies We are all humans but some of us are just more mortal than others Because their history in Europe and elsewhere has been one of lethal exclusions and fatal disqualiﬁ cations these others raise issues of power and exclusion We need more ethical accountability in dealing with the legacy of Human ism Tony Davies puts it lucidly All Humanisms until now have been imperial They speak of the human in the accents and the interests of a class a sex a race a genome Their embrace suffocates those whom it does not ignore    It is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been com mitted in the name of humanity Davies 1997 141 Indeed but it is also the case unfortunately that many atrocities have been committed in the name of the hatred for humanity as shown by the case of PekkaEric Auvinen in the ﬁ rst vignette in the introduction PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Humanisms restricted notion of what counts as the human is one of the keys to understand how we got to a posthuman turn at all The itinerary is far from simple or predictable Edward Said for instance complicates the picture by intro ducing a postcolonial angle Humanism as protective or even defensive nationalism is    a mixed blessing for its    ideological ferocity and triumphalism although it is sometimes inevitable In a colonial setting for example a revival of the suppressed languages and cultures the attempts at national assertion through cultural tradition and glorious ancestors    are explainable and understandable Said 2004 37 This qualiﬁ cation is crucial in pointing out the importance of where one is actually speaking from Differ ences of location between centres and margins matter greatly especially in relation to the legacy of something as complex and multifaceted as Humanism Complicitous with geno cides and crimes on the one hand supportive of enormous hopes and aspirations to freedom on the other Humanism somehow defeats linear criticism This protean quality is partly responsible for its longevity AntiHumanism Let me put my cards on the table at this early stage of the argument I am none too fond of Humanism or of the idea of the human which it implicitly upholds Antihumanism is so much part of my intellectual and personal genealogy as well as family background that for me the crisis of Human ism is almost a banality Why Politics and philosophy are the main reasons for the glee with which I have always greeted the notion of the historical decline of Humanism with its Eurocentric core and imperial tendencies Of course the historical context has a lot to do with it I came of age intellectually and politically in the tur bulent years after the Second World War when the Humanist ideal came to be questioned quite radically Throughout the 1960s and 1970s an activist brand of antiHumanism was developed by the new social movements and the youth cul tures of the day feminism decolonization and antiracism antinuclear and paciﬁ st movements Chronologically linked PostHumanism Life beyond the Self the babyboomers these social movements produced radical political social theories and new epistemologies They chal lenged the platitudes of Cold War rhetoric with its emphasis on Western democracy liberal individualism and the freedom they allegedly ensured for all Nothing smacks more like a theoretical midlife crisis than to acknowledge ones afﬁ liation to the babyboomers The public image of this generation is not exactly edifying at this point in time Nonetheless truth be said that generation was marked by the traumatic legacy of the many failed political experiments of the twentieth century Fascism and the Holo caust on the one hand Communism and the Gulag on the other strike a blooddrenched balance on the comparative scale of horrors There is a clear generational link between these historical phenomena and the rejection of Humanism in the 1960s and 1970s Let me explain At the levels of their own ideological content these two historical phenomena Fascism and Communism rejected openly or implicitly the basic tenets of European Humanism and betrayed them violently They remain however quite dif ferent as movements in their structures and aims Whereas fascism preached a ruthless departure from the very roots of Enlightenmentbased respect for the autonomy of reason and the moral good socialism pursued a communitarian notion of humanist solidarity Socialist Humanism had been a feature of the European Left since the utopian socialist movements of the eighteenth century Admittedly MarxistLeninism rejected these softheaded aspects of socialist humanism notably the emphasis on the fulﬁ lment of the human beings potential for authenticity as opposed to alienation It offered as an alter native proletarian Humanism also known as the revolu tionary Humanism of the USSR and its ruthless pursuit of universal rational human freedom through and under Communism Two factors contributed to the relative popularity of com munist Humanism in the postwar era The ﬁ rst is the disas trous effects of Fascism upon European social but also intellectual history The period of Fascism and Nazism enacted a major disruption in the history of critical theory in Continen tal Europe in that it destroyed and banned from Europe the PostHumanism Life beyond the Self very schools of thought  notably Marxism psychoanalysis the Frankfurt School and the disruptive charge of Nietzschean genealogy though the case of Nietzsche is admittedly quite complex  which had been central to philosophy in the earlier part of the twentieth century Moreover the Cold War and the opposition of the two geopolitical blocks which followed the end of the Second World War kept Europe split asunder and dichotomized until 1989 and did not facilitate the reimplan tation of those radical theories back into the Continent which had cast them away with such violence and selfdestruction It is signiﬁ cant for instance that most of the authors which Michel Foucault singled out as heralding the philosophical era of critical postmodernity Marx Freud Darwin are the same authors whom the Nazis condemned and burned at the stake in the 1930s The second reason for the popularity of Marxist Humanism is that Communism under the aegis of the USSR played a pivotal role in defeating Fascism and hence to all ends and purposes came out of the Second World War as the winner It follows therefore that the generation that came of age politi cally in 1968 inherited a positive view of Marxist praxis and ideology as a result of socialists and communists opposition to fascism and to the Soviet Unions war effort against Nazism This clashes with the almost epidermic anticommunism of American culture and remains to date a point of great intel lectual tension between Europe and the USA It is sometimes difﬁ cult at the dawn of the third millennium to remember that Communist parties were the single largest emblem of anti fascist resistance throughout Europe They also played a sig niﬁ cant role in national liberation movements throughout the world notably in Africa and Asia André Malrauxs seminal text Mans Fate La condition humaine 1934 bears testimony to both the moral stature and the tragic dimension of Com munism as does in a different era and geopolitical context Nelson Mandelas 1994 life and work Speaking from his position within the United States of America Edward Said adds another signiﬁ cant insight Antihumanism took hold on the United States intellectual scene partly because of widespread revulsion with the Vietnam War Part of that revulsion was the emergence of a resistance move ment to racism imperialism generally and the dryasdust aca PostHumanism Life beyond the Self demic Humanities that had for years represented an apolitical unworldly and oblivious sometimes even manipulative atti tude to the present all the while adamantly extolling the virtues of the past 2004 13 The new Left in the USA throughout the 1960s and 1970s embodied a militant brand of radical antihumanism which was posited in opposition not only to the Liberal majority but also to the Marxist Humanism of the traditional Left I am fully aware of the fact that the notion that Marxism by now socially coded as an inhumane and violent ideology may actually be a Humanism will shock the younger genera tions and all who are unschooled in Continental philosophy Sufﬁ ce it however to think of the emphasis that philosophers of the calibre of Sartre and de Beauvoir placed on Humanism as a secular tool of critical analysis to see how the argument may have shaped up Existentialism stressed Humanist con science as the source of both moral responsibility and politi cal freedom France occupies a very special position in the genealogy of antihumanist critical theory The prestige of French intellectu als was linked not only to the formidable educational structure of that country but also to contextual considerations Fore most among them is the high moral stature of France at the end of the Second World War thanks to the antiNazi resist ance of Charles de Gaulle French intellectuals continued accordingly to enjoy a very high status especially in compari son with the wasteland that was postwar Germany Hence the huge international reputation of Sartre and de Beauvoir but also Aron Mauriac Camus and Malraux Tony Judt sums it up succinctly 2005 210 Despite Frances shattering defeat in 1940 its humiliating sub jugation under four years of German occupation the moral ambiguity and worse of Marshall Petains Vichy regime and the countrys embarrassing subordination to the US and Britain in the international diplomacy of the postwar years French culture became once again the centre of international attention French intellectuals acquired a special international signiﬁ cance as spokesmen for the age and the tenor of French political arguments epitomised the ideological rent in the world at large Once more  and for the last time  Paris was the capital of Europe PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Throughout the postwar years Paris continued to function as a magnet that attracted and engendered all sorts of critical thinkers For example Alexandr Solzhenitsyns The Gulag Archipelago was ﬁ rst published in France in the 1970s after being smuggled out of the USSR in samizdat form It was out of his Parisian retreat that the Ayatollah Khomeini led the Iranian revolution of 1979 which installed the worlds ﬁ rst Islamist government In some ways the French context of those days was open to all sorts of radical political movements As a matter of fact so many critical schools of thought ﬂ ourished on the Left and Right Bank in that period that French philoso phy became almost synonymous with theory itself with mixed longterm consequences as we shall see in chapter 4 Up until the 1960s philosophical reason had escaped rela tively unscathed from the question of its responsibilities in perpetuating historical models of domination and exclusion Both Sartre and de Beauvoir inﬂ uenced by Marxist theories of alienation and ideology did connect the triumph of reason with the might of dominant powers thus disclosing the complicity between philosophical ratio and reallife social practices of injustice They continued however to defend a universalist idea of reason and to rely on a dialectical model for the resolu tion of these contradictions This methodological approach while being critical of hegemonic models of violent appropria tion and consumption of the others also deﬁ ned the task of philosophy as a privileged and culturally hegemonic tool of political analysis With Sartre and de Beauvoir the image of the philosopherking is built into the general picture albeit in a critical mode As a critic of ideology and the conscience of the oppressed the philosopher is a thinking human being who continues to pursue grand theoretical systems and over arching truths Sartre and de Beauvoir consider humanistic universalism as the distinctive trait of Western culture ie its speciﬁ c form of particularism They use the conceptual tools provided by Humanism to precipitate a confrontation of phi losophy with its own historical responsibilities and conceptual powerbrokering This humanistic universalism coupled with the social con structivist emphasis on the manmade and historically variable nature of social inequalities lays the grounds for a robust political ontology For instance de Beauvoirs emancipatory PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Figure 12 New Vitruvian Woman Source Friedrich SaurerScience Photo Library feminism builds on the Humanist principle that Woman is the measure of all things female see ﬁ gure 12 and that to account for herself the feminist philosopher needs to take into account the situation of all women This creates on the theoretical level a productive synthesis of self and others Politically the Vitruvian female forged a bond of solidarity between one and the many which in the hands of the second feminist wave in the 1960s was to grow into the principle of political sisterhood This posits a common grounding among women taking beingwomenintheworld as the starting PostHumanism Life beyond the Self point for all critical reﬂ ection and jointly articulated political praxis Humanist feminism introduced a new brand of material ism of the embodied and embedded kind Braidotti 1991 The cornerstone of this theoretical innovation is a speciﬁ c brand of situated epistemology Haraway 1988 which evolved from the practice of the politics of locations Rich 1987 and infused standpoint feminist theory and the subsequent debates with postmodernist feminism throughout the 1990s Harding 1991 The theoretical premise of humanist feminism is a mate rialist notion of embodiment that spells the premises of new and more accurate analyses of power These are based on the radical critique of masculinist universalism but are still depend ent on a form of activist and equalityminded Humanism Feminist theory and practice worked faster and more efﬁ  ciently than most social movements of the 1970s It developed original tools and methods of analysis that allowed for more incisive accounts of how power works Feminists also explicitly targeted the masculinism and the sexist habits of the allegedly revolutionary Left and denounced them as contradictory with their ideology as well as intrinsically offensive Within the mainstream Left however a new generation of postwar thinkers had other priorities They rebelled against the high moral status of postwar European Communist parties in Western Europe as well as in the Soviet empire This had resulted in an authoritarian hold over the interpretation of Marxist texts and their key philosophical concepts The new forms of philosophical radicalism developed in France and throughout Europe in the late 1960s expressed a vocal critique of the dogmatic structure of Communist thought and practice They included a critique of the political alliance between phi losophers like Sartre and de Beauvoir and the Communist Left1 which lasted at least until the Hungarian insurrection of 1956 In response to the dogma and the violence of Communism the generation of 1968 appealed directly to the subversive potential of the texts of Marx so as to recover their antiinstitutional roots Their radicalism was expressed in terms of a critique of Communist Party PostHumanism Life beyond the Self the institutions that embodied Marxist dogma Antihumanism emerged as the rallying cry of this genera tion of radical thinkers who later were to became worldfamous as the poststructuralist generation In fact they were post communists avant la lettre They stepped out of the dialectical oppositional thinking and developed a third way to deal with changing understandings of human subjectivity By the time Michel Foucault published his groundbreaking critique of Humanism in The Order of Things 1970 the question of what if anything was the idea of the human was circulating in the radical discourses of the time and had set the anti humanist agenda for an array of political groups The death of Man announced by Foucault formalizes an epistemologi cal and moral crisis that goes beyond binary oppositions and cuts across the different poles of the political spectrum What is targeted is the implicit Humanism of Marxism more spe ciﬁ cally the humanistic arrogance of continuing to place Man at the centre of world history Even Marxism under the cover of a master theory of historical materialism continued to deﬁ ne the subject of European thought as unitary and hege monic and to assign him the gender is no coincidence a royal place as the motor of human history Antihumanism consists in delinking the human agent from this universalistic posture calling him to task so to speak on the concrete actions he is enacting Different and sharper power relations emerge once this formerly dominant subject is freed from his delusions of grandeur and is no longer allegedly in charge of historical progress The radical thinkers of the post1968 generation rejected Humanism both in its classical and its socialist versions The Vitruvian ideal of Man as the standard of both perfection and perfectibility as shown in ﬁ gure 11 was literally pulled down from his pedestal and deconstructed This humanistic ideal constituted in fact the core of a liberal individualistic view of the subject which deﬁ ned perfectibility in terms of autonomy and selfdetermination These are precisely the qualiﬁ cations the poststructuralists objected to It turned out that this Man far from being the canon of perfect proportions spelling out a universalistic ideal that by PostHumanism Life beyond the Self now had reached the status of a natural law was in fact a historical construct and as such contingent as to values and locations Individualism is not an intrinsic part of human nature as liberal thinkers are prone to believe but rather a historically and culturally speciﬁ c discursive formation one which moreover is becoming increasingly problematic The deconstructive brand of social constructivism introduced by poststructuralist thinkers like Jacques Derrida 2001a also contributed to a radical revision of the Humanist tenets An entire philosophical generation called for insubordination from received Humanist ideas of human nature Feminists like Luce Irigaray 1985a 1985b pointed out that the allegedly abstract ideal of Man as a symbol of clas sical Humanity is very much a male of the species it is a he Moreover he is white European handsome and ablebodied of his sexuality nothing much can be guessed though plenty of speculation surrounds that of its painter Leonardo da Vinci What this ideal model may have in common with the statistical average of most members of the species and the civilization he is supposed to represent is a very good question indeed Feminist critiques of patriarchal posturing through abstract masculinity Hartsock 1987 and triumphant white ness hooks 1981 Ware 1992 argued that this Humanist universalism is objectionable not only on epistemological but also on ethical and political grounds Anticolonial thinkers adopted a similar critical stance by questioning the primacy of whiteness in the Vitruvian ideal as the aesthetic canon of beauty see ﬁ gure 12 Re grounding such lofty claims onto the history of colonialism antiracist and postcolonial thinkers explicitly questioned the relevance of the Humanistic ideal in view of the obvious contradictions imposed by its Eurocentric assumptions but at the same time they did not entirely cast it aside They held the Europeans accountable for the uses and abuses of this ideal by looking at colonial history and the violent domina tion of other cultures but still upheld its basic premises Frantz Fanon for instance wanted to rescue Humanism from its European perpetuators arguing that we have betrayed and misused the humanist ideal As Sartre put it in his preface to Fanons The Wretched of the Earth 1963 7 the yellow and black voices still spoke of our Humanism but only to PostHumanism Life beyond the Self reproach us with our inhumanity Postcolonial thought asserts that if Humanism has a future at all it has to come from outside the Western world and bypass the limitations of Eurocentrism By extension the claim to universality by scientiﬁ c rationality is challenged on both epistemological and political grounds Spivak 1999 Said 2004 all knowl edge claims being expressions of Western culture and of its drive to mastery French poststructuralist philosophers pursued the same postcolonial aim through different routes and means2 They argued that in the aftermath of colonialism Auschwitz Hiro shima and the Gulag  to mention but a few of the horrors of modern history  we Europeans need to develop a critique of Europes delusion of grandeur in positing ourselves as the moral guardian of the world and as the motor of human evolution Thus the philosophical generation of the 1970s that proclaimed the death of Man was antifascist post communist postcolonial and posthumanist in a variety of different combinations of the terms They led to the rejection of the classical deﬁ nition of European identity in terms of Humanism rationality and the universal The feminist phi losophies of sexual difference3 through the spectrum of the critique of dominant masculinity also stressed the ethno centric nature of European claims to universalism They advocated the need to open it up to the others within Kristeva 1991 in such a way as to relocate diversity and multiple belongings to a central position as a structural com ponent of European subjectivity Antihumanism is consequently an important source for posthuman thought It is by no means the only one nor is the connection between antihumanism and the posthuman logically necessary or historically inevitable And yet it turned out to be so for my own work although this story is still unﬁ nished and in some ways as I will argue in the next section my relation to Humanism remains unresolved 2 This line is pursued in philosophy by Deleuzes rejection of the transcendental vision of the subject 1994 Irigarays decentring of phallogocentrism 1985a 1985b Foucaults critique of Humanism 1977 and Derridas deconstruction of Eurocentrism 1992 3 See for instance Irigaray 1993 Cixous 1997 and Braidotti 1991 PostHumanism Life beyond the Self The Death of Man the Deconstruction of Woman As indicated in the genealogical itinerary I have just sketched antihumanism is one of the historical and theoretical paths that can lead to the posthuman I owe my antihumanism to my beloved post1968 teachers some of whom were amazing philosophers whose legacy I continue to respect and admire Foucault Irigaray and Deleuze especially The human of Humanism is neither an ideal nor an objective statistical average or middle ground It rather spells out a systematized standard of recognizability  of Sameness  by which all others can be assessed regulated and allotted to a designated social location The human is a normative convention which does not make it inherently negative just highly regulatory and hence instru mental to practices of exclusion and discrimination The human norm stands for normality normalcy and normativity It func tions by transposing a speciﬁ c mode of being human into a generalized standard which acquires transcendent values as the human from male to masculine and onto human as the uni versalized format of humanity This standard is posited as categorically and qualitatively distinct from the sexualized racialized naturalized others and also in opposition to the technological artefact The human is a historical construct that became a social convention about human nature My antihumanism leads me to object to the unitary subject of Humanism including its socialist variables and to replace it with a more complex and relational subject framed by embodiment sexuality affectivity empathy and desire as core qualities Equally central to this approach is the insight I learned from Foucault on power as both a restrictive potes tas and productive potentia force This means that power formations not only function at the material level but are also expressed in systems of theoretical and cultural representa tion political and normative narratives and social modes of identiﬁ cation These are neither coherent nor rational and their makeshift nature is instrumental to their hegemonic force The awareness of the instability and the lack of coher ence of the narratives that compose the social structures and relations far from resulting in a suspension of political and PostHumanism Life beyond the Self moral action become the starting point to elaborate new forms of resistance suited to the polycentric and dynamic structure of contemporary power Patton 2000 This engen ders a pragmatic form of micropolitics that reﬂ ects the complex and nomadic nature of contemporary social systems and of the subjects that inhabit them If power is complex scattered and productive so must be our resistance to it Once this deconstructive move is activated both the standard notion of Man and his second sex Woman are challenged in terms of their internal complexities This clearly affects the task and the methods status of theory Discourse as Michel Foucault argues in Discipline and Punish 1977 is about the political currency that is attributed to certain meanings or systems of meaning in such a way as to invest them with scientiﬁ c legitimacy there is nothing neutral or given about it Thus a critical materialist link is established between scientiﬁ c truth discursive currency and power relations This approach of discourse analysis primarily aims at dislodging the belief in the natural founda tions of socially coded and enforced differences and of the systems of scientiﬁ c validity ethical values and representation which they support Coward and Ellis 19774 Feminist antiHumanism also known as postmodernist feminism rejected the unitary identities indexed on that Eurocentric and normative humanist ideal of Man Braid otti 2002 It went further however and argued that it is impossible to speak in one uniﬁ ed voice about women natives and other marginal subjects The emphasis falls instead on issues of diversity and differences among them and on the internal fractures of each category In this respect anti humanism rejects the dialectical scheme of thought where difference or otherness played a constitutive role marking off the sexualized other woman the racialized other the native and the naturalized other animals the environment or earth These others were constitutive in that they fulﬁ lled a mirror 4 This approach has also been adopted by intersectional analysis which argues for the methodological parallelism of gender race class and sexual factors without ﬂ attening out any differences between them but rather investing politically the question of their complex interaction Crenshaw 1995 PostHumanism Life beyond the Self function that conﬁ rmed the Same in His superior position Braidotti 2006 This political economy of difference resulted in passing off entire categories of human beings as devalued and therefore disposable others to be different from came to mean to be less than The dominant norm of the subject was positioned at the pinnacle of a hierarchical scale that rewarded the ideal of zerodegree of difference5 This is the former Man of classical Humanism The negative dialectical processes of sexualization raciali zation and naturalization of those who are marginalized or excluded have another important implication they result in the active production of halftruths or forms of partial knowledge about these others Dialectical and pejorative oth erness induces structural ignorance about those who by being others are posited as the outside of major categorical divides in the attribution of Humanity Paul Gilroy 2010 refers to this phenomenon as agnatology or enforced and structural ignorance This is one of the paradoxical effects of the alleged universalist reach of humanist knowledge The bellicose dismissiveness of other cultures and civiliza tions is what Edward Said criticizes as selfpuffery not humanism and certainly not enlightened criticism 2004 27 The reduction to subhuman status of nonWestern others is a constitutive source of ignorance falsity and bad conscious ness for the dominant subject who is responsible for their epistemic as well as social dehumanization These radical critiques of humanistic arrogance from femi nist and postcolonial theory are not merely negative because they propose new alternative ways to look at the human from a more inclusive and diverse angle They also offer signiﬁ cant and innovative insights into the image of thought that is implicitly conveyed by the humanistic vision of Man as the measure of all things standardbearer of the human Thus they further the analysis of power by developing the 5 Deleuze calls it the Majority subject or the Molar centre of being Deleuze and Guattari 1987 Irigaray calls it the Same or the

beyond the Self with masculinism racism white superiority the dogma of scientiﬁ c reason and other socially supported systems of dom inant values Having practically grown up with theories about the death of God Nietzsche the end of Man Foucault and the decline of ideologies Fukuyama it took me a while to realize that actually one touches humanism at ones own risk and peril The antihumanist position is certainly not free of contradic tions As Badmington wisely reminds us Apocalyptic accounts of the end of man    ignore Humanisms capacity for regeneration and quite literally recapitulation 2003 11 The Vitruvian Man rises over and over again from his ashes con tinues to uphold universal standards and to exercise a fatal attraction The thought did occur to me as I was listening to Diamanda Galas Plague Mass 1991 for the victims of AIDS it is one thing to loudly announce an antihumanist stance quite another to act accordingly with a modicum of consistency Anti humanism is a position fraught with such contradictions that the more one tries to overcome them the more slippery it gets Not only do antihumanists often end up espousing humanist ideals  freedom being my favourite one  but also in some ways the work of critical thought is supported by intrinsic humanist discursive values Soper 1986 Somehow neither humanism nor antihumanism is adequate to the task The best example of the intrinsic contradictions generated by the antihumanist stance is emancipation and progressive politics in general which I consider one of the most valuable aspects of the humanistic tradition and its most enduring legacy Across the political spectrum Humanism has supported on the liberal side individualism autonomy responsibility and selfdetermination Todorov 2002 On the more radical front it has promoted solidarity communitybonding social justice and principles of equality Profoundly secular in orientation Humanism promotes respect for science and culture against the authority of holy texts and religious dogma It also con tains an adventurous element a curiositydriven yearning for discovery and a projectoriented approach that is extremely valuable in its pragmatism These principles are so deeply PostHumanism Life beyond the Self entrenched in our habits of thought that it is difﬁ cult to leave them behind altogether And why should we Antihumanism criticizes the implicit assumptions about the human subject that are upheld by the humanist image of Man but this does not amount to a com plete rejection For me it is impossible both intellectually and ethically to disengage the positive elements of Humanism from their problematic counterparts individualism breeds egotism and selfcentredness selfdetermination can turn to arrogance and domination and science is not free from its own dogmatic tendencies The difﬁ culties inherent in trying to overcome Humanism as an intellectual tradition a normative frame and an institutionalized practice lie at the core of the deconstruc tive approach to the posthuman Derrida 2001a opened this discussion by pointing out the violence implicit in the assigna tion of meaning His followers pressed the case further the assertion that Humanism can be decisively left behind ironi cally subscribes to a basic humanist assumption with regard to volition and agency as if the end of Humanism might be subjected to human control as if we bear the capacity to erase the traces of Humanism from either the present or an imagined future Peterson 2011 128 The emphasis falls therefore on the difﬁ culty of erasing the trace of the epistemic violence by which a nonhumanist position might be carved out of the institutions of Humanism The acknowledgment of epistemic violence goes hand in hand with the recognition of the reallife violence which was and still is practised against nonhuman animals and the dehumanized social and political others of the humanist norm In this deconstructive tradi tion Cary Wolfe 2010b is especially interesting as he attempts to strike a new position that combines sensitivity to epistemic and wordhistorical violence with a distinctly trans humanist faith Bostrom 2005 in the potential of the post human condition as conducive to human enhancement I have great respect for deconstruction but also some impatience with the limitations of its linguistic frame of refer ence I prefer to take a more materialist route to deal with the complexities of the posthuman as a key feature of our historicity That road too is fraught with perils as we shall see in the next section PostHumanism Life beyond the Self As a progressive political creed Humanism bears a privileged relation to two other interlocked ideas human emancipation in the pursuit of equality and secularism through rational governance These two premises emerge from the concept of Humanism just like the classical goddess Athena is raised from Zeus head fully clad and armed for battle As John Gray 2002 xiii argued Humanism is the transformation of the Christian doctrine of salvation into a project of uni versal human emancipation The idea of progress is a secular version of the Christian belief in providence That is why among the ancient pagans it was unknown It is not surpris ing therefore that one of the sideeffects of the decline of Humanism is the rise of the postsecular condition Braidotti 2008 Habermas 2008 If the death of Man proved to be a bit of a hasty statement that of God turned out to be positively delusional The ﬁ rst cracks in the ediﬁ ce of selfassured secularity appeared at the end of the 1970s As the revolutionary zeal cooled off and social movements started to dissipate conform or mutate former militant agnostics joined a wave of conversions to a variety of conventional monotheistic or imported Eastern religions This turn of events raised serious doubts as to the future of secularity The doubt crept into the collective and individual mind how secular are we  feminists antiracists postcolonialists environmentalists etc  really The doubt was even sharper for intellectual activists Science is intrinsically secular secularity being a key tenet of Humanism alongside universalism the unitary subject and the primacy of rationality Science itself however in spite of its secular foundations is far from immune from its own forms of dogmatism Freud was one of the ﬁ rst critical think ers to warn us against the fanatical atheism of the supporters of scientiﬁ c reason In The Future of an Illusion 1928 Freud compares different forms of rigid dogmatism classifying rationalist scientism alongside religion as a source of supersti tious belief a position best illustrated today by the extremism with which Richard Dawkins defends his atheist faith Dawkins 1976 Moreover the muchcelebrated objectivity PostHumanism Life beyond the Self of science has also been shown to be quite ﬂ awed The uses and abuses of scientiﬁ c experimentation under Fascism and in the colonial era prove that science is not immunized against nationalist racist and hegemonic discourses and practices Any claim to scientiﬁ c purity objectivity and autonomy needs therefore to be ﬁ rmly resisted Where does that leave Human ism and its antihumanist critics Secularity is one of the pillars of Western Humanism thus an instinctive form of aversion to religion and to the church is historically an integral aspect of emancipatory politics The socialist humanist tradition which was so central to the European Left and the womens movements in Europe since the eighteenth century is justiﬁ ed in claiming to be secular in the narrow sense of the term to be agnostic if not atheist and to descend from the Enlightenment critique of religious dogma and clerical authority Like other emancipatory phi losophies and political practices the feminist struggle for womens rights in Europe has historically built on secular foundations The lasting inﬂ uence exercised by existentialist feminism de Beauvoir 1973 and Marxist or socialist femi nisms6 on the second feminist wave may also account for the perpetuation of this position As the secular and rebellious daughters of the Enlightenment European feminists were raised in rational argumentation and detached selfirony The feminist beliefsystem is accordingly civic not theistic and viscerally opposed to authoritarianism and orthodoxy Femi nist politics is also and at the same time a doubleedged vision Kelly 1979 that combines rational arguments with political passions and creates alternative social blueprints and value systems However proud twentiethcentury feminism may be of its secular roots it is nonetheless the case that it has historically produced various alternative spiritual practices alongside and often in antagonism to the mainstream political secularist line Major writers in the radical feminist tradition of the second American wave notably Audre Lorde 1984 Alice 6 Central ﬁ gures in this tradition are Firestone 1970 Rowbotham 1973 Mitchell 1974 Barrett 1980 Davis 1981 Coward 1983 and Delphy 1984 PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Walker 1984 and Adrienne Rich 1987 acknowledged the importance of the spiritual dimension of womens struggle for equality and symbolic recognition The work of Mary Daly 1973 Schussler Fiorenza 1983 and Luce Irigaray 1993 to name but a few highlights a speciﬁ c feminist tradi tion of nonmalecentred spiritual and religious practices Feminist theology in the Christian Keller 1998 Wadud 1999 Muslim Tayyab 1998 and Judaic Adler 1998 tra ditions produced wellestablished communities of both criti cal resistance and afﬁ rmation of creative alternatives The call for new rituals and ceremonies makes the fortune of the witches movement currently best exempliﬁ ed by Starhawk 1999 and reclaimed among others by the epistemologist Stengers 1997 Neopagan elements have also emerged in technologically mediated cyberculture producing various brands of posthuman technoasceticism Halberstam and Livingston 1995 Braidotti 2002 Black and postcolonial theories have never been loudly secular In the very religious context of the USA African American womens literature is ﬁ lled with PostHumanism Life beyond the Self The notion that ﬂ atly and hastily equates secularity and secularism with womens emancipation emerges therefore as problematic As Joan Scott cogently argues 2007 this notion can be easily challenged by contradictory historical evidence If we take for instance the French Revolution as the histori cal point of origin of European secularism there is no evi dence that a concern for the equal status of women was a priority for those who acted to separate church from state High secularism is essentially a political doctrine of the sepa ration of powers which was even historically consolidated in Europe and is still prominent in political theory today British Humanist Association 2007 This tradition of secularism however introduces a polarization between religion and citi zenship which is socially enacted in a new partition between a private belief system and the public political sphere This publicprivate distinction is thoroughly gendered Histori cally women in Europe have been assigned to both the private domain and to the realm of faith and religion Humanism being white Mans burden This traditional attribution of religious faith to women stands in the way of granting them full political citizenship European women were encouraged to engage in religious activity rather than to participate in public affairs This is not only a source of social marginaliza tion but also a dubious privilege in view of the entrenched sexism of monotheistic religions and their shared conviction of the necessity to exclude women from the ministry and the administration of sacred functions Secularity therefore rein forced the distinction between emotions or unreason includ ing faith and rational judgement In this polarized scheme women were assigned to the pole of unreason passions and emotions including religion and these factors combined to keep them in the private sphere Thus secularism actually reenforces the oppression of women and their exclusion from the public sphere of rational citizenship and politics The fact that idealized secularism in European political history does not guarantee that women were considered the political equals of men opens a series of critical questions according to Joan Scott What are European feminists to make of the fact that both logically and historically equality within the secular state does not guarantee the respect for difference let alone diversity PostHumanism Life beyond the Self the aftermath of decades of antihumanist critical theory which generated innovative feminist postcolonial and envi ronmental insights Complexity becomes the key word as it is clear that one single narrative does not sufﬁ ce to account for secularity as an unﬁ nished project and its relationship to Humanism and emancipatory politics A postsecular approach posited on ﬁ rm antihumanist grounds makes manifest the previously unacceptable notion that rational agency and political subjectivity can actually be conveyed through and supported by religious piety and may even involve signiﬁ cant amounts of spirituality Belief systems and their rituals are perhaps not incompatible with critical thought and practices of citizenship Simone de Beauvoir would be distressed at the very suggestion of such a possibility Let me approach the limits of the feminist secular position from another angle My monistic philosophy of becomings rests on the idea that matter including the speciﬁ c slice of matter that is human embodiment is intelligent and self organizing This means that matter is not dialectically opposed to culture nor to technological mediation but continuous with them This produces a different scheme of emancipation and a nondialectical politics of human liberation This posi tion has another important corollary namely that political agency need not be critical in the negative sense of opposi tional and thus may not be aimed solely or primarily at the production of countersubjectivities Subjectivity is rather a process of autopoiesis or selfstyling which involves complex and continuous negotiations with dominant norms and values and hence also multiple forms of accountability Braidotti 2006 This processoriented political ontology can accom modate a postsecular turn a position that is also defended within feminism by a variety of thinkers such as Harding 2000 and Mahmood 2005 The double challenge of linking political subjectivity to religious agency and of disen gaging both from oppositional consciousness and from cri tique deﬁ ned as negativity is one of the main issues raised by the posthumanist condition Things around Humanism however are always more complex than one expects them to be The return of religion in the public sphere and the strident tone reached by the PostHumanism Life beyond the Self global public debate on the clash of civilizations not to speak of the permanent state of war on terror that ensued from this context took many antihumanists by surprise To speak of a return of religion is inappropriate as it suggests a regressive movement What we are experiencing at present is a more complicated situation The crisis of secularism deﬁ ned as the essentialist belief in the axioms of secularity is a phenomenon that takes place within the social and political horizon of late globalized postmodernity not in premodern times It is of the here and now Moreover it spreads across all religions amidst both second and third generation descend ants of Muslim immigrants and amidst bornagain funda mentalist Christians and by Hindi Hebrew and others This is the paradoxical and violent global context where the posture of Western exceptionalism has taken the form of selfaggrandizing praise of the Enlightenment Humanist legacy This claim to an exceptional cultural status fore grounds the emancipation of women gays and lesbians as the deﬁ ning feature of the West coupled with extensive geo political armed interventions against the rest Humanism has once again become enlisted in a civilizational crusade Simul taneously overestimated in its emancipatory historical role and manipulated for xenophobic purposes by populist politi cians across Europe Humanism may need to be rescued from these oversimpliﬁ cations and violent abuses I wonder there fore whether nowadays one can continue to uphold a simple antihumanist position Is a residual form of Humanism inev itable intellectually politically and methodologically after all If the new belligerent discourses about the alleged supe riority of the West are expressed in terms of the legacy of secular Humanism while the most vehement opposition to them takes the form of postsecular practices of politicized religion where can an antihumanist position rest To be simply secular would be complicitous with neocolonial Western supremacist positions while rejecting the Enlighten ment legacy would be inherently contradictory for any critical project The vicious circle is stiﬂ ing It is out of contradictions of this magnitude that the seem ingly endless polemic between Humanism and antihuman ism reaches a deadend This position is not only unproductive it also actively prevents an adequate reading of our immediate PostHumanism Life beyond the Self context Leaving behind the tensions that surround Human ism and its selfcontradictory refutation is now a priority Another option becomes increasingly desirable and necessary posthumanism as a move beyond these lethal binaries Let us turn to it next The Posthuman Challenge Posthumanism is the historical moment that marks the end of the opposition between Humanism and antihumanism and traces a different discursive framework looking more afﬁ rmatively towards new alternatives The starting point for me is the antihumanist death of WoMan which marks the decline of some of the fundamental premises of the Enlighten ment namely the progress of mankind through a self regulatory and teleological ordained use of reason and of secular scientiﬁ c rationality allegedly aimed at the perfect ibility of Man The posthumanist perspective rests on the assumption of the historical decline of Humanism but goes further in exploring alternatives without sinking into the rhetoric of the crisis of Man It works instead towards elabo rating alternative ways of conceptualizing the human subject I will emphasize the priority of the issue of posthuman sub jectivity throughout this book The crisis of Humanism means that the structural others of the modern humanistic subject reemerge with a vengeance in postmodernity Braidotti 2002 It is a historical fact that the great emancipatory movements of postmodernity are driven and fuelled by the resurgent others the womens rights movement the antiracism and decolonization move ments the antinuclear and proenvironment movements are the voices of the structural Others of modernity They inevi tably mark the crisis of the former humanist centre or domi nant subjectposition and are not merely antihumanist but move beyond it to an altogether novel posthuman project These social and political movements are simultaneously the symptom of the crisis of the subject and for conservatives even its cause and also the expression of positive proactive alternatives In the language of my nomadic theory Braidotti 2011a 2011b they express both the crisis of the majority PostHumanism Life beyond the Self and the patterns of becoming of the minorities The challenge for critical theory consists in being able to tell the difference between these different ﬂ ows of mutation In other words the posthumanist position I am defending builds on the antihumanist legacy more speciﬁ cally on the epistemological and political foundations of the post structuralist generation and moves further The alternative views about the human and the new formations of subjectiv ity that have emerged from the radical epistemologies of Continental philosophy in the last thirty years do not merely oppose Humanism but create other visions of the self Sexual ized racialized and naturalized differences far from being the categorical boundarykeepers of the subject of Humanism have evolved into fully ﬂ edged alternative models of the human subject The extent to which they bring about the displacement of the human will become even clearer in the next chapter which analyses the postanthropocentric turn For now I want to emphasize this shift away from anti Humanism towards an afﬁ rmative posthuman position and examine critically some of its components I see three major strands in contemporary posthuman thought the ﬁ rst comes from moral philosophy and develops a reactive form of the posthuman the second from science and technology studies enforces an analytic form of the posthu man and the third from my own tradition of antihumanist philosophies of subjectivity proposes a critical posthumanism Let us look at each of these in turn The reactive approach to the posthuman is defended both conceptually and politically by contemporary liberal thinkers like Martha Nussbaum 1999 2010 She develops a thorough contemporary defence of Humanism as the guarantee of democracy freedom and the respect for human dignity and rejects the very idea of a crisis of European Humanism let alone the possibility of its historical decline Nussbaum does acknowledge the challenges presented by contemporary tech nologydriven global economies but responds to them by re asserting classical humanist ideals and progressive liberal politics She defends the need for universal humanistic values as a remedy for the fragmentation and the relativistic drift of our times which is the result of globalization itself Human istic cosmopolitan universalism is also presented as an anti PostHumanism Life beyond the Self dote against nationalism and ethnocentrism which plague the contemporary world and to the prevailing American attitude of ignorance of the rest of the world Central to the reactive or negative posthumanism of Nuss baum is the idea that one of the effects of globalization is a sort of recontextualization induced by the market economy This produces a new sense of interconnection which in turn calls for a neohumanist ethics For Nussbaum abstract uni versalism is the only stance that is capable of providing solid foundations for moral values such as compassion and respect for others which she ﬁ rmly attaches to the tradition of Amer ican liberal individualism I am very happy that Nussbaum stresses the importance of subjectivity but less happy about the fact that she reattaches it to a universalistic belief in individualism ﬁ xed identities steady locations and moral ties that bind In other words Nussbaum rejects the insights of the radical antihumanist philosophies of the last thirty years Notably she embraces universalism over and against the feminist and postcolonial insights about the importance of the politics of location and careful grounding in geopolitical terms By embracing disembedded universalism Nussbaum ends up being paradoxically parochial in her vision of what counts as the human Bhabha 1996a There is no room for experimenting with new models of the self for Nussbaum the posthuman condition can be solved by restoring a humanist vision of the subject As we shall see in the next section whereas Nussbaum ﬁ lls the ethical vacuum of the globalized world with classical Humanistic norms critical posthumanists take the experimental path They attempt to devise renewed claims to community and belonging by sin gular subjects who have taken critical distance from humanist individualism A second signiﬁ cant posthuman development comes from science and technology studies This contemporary interdisciplinary ﬁ eld raises crucial ethical and conceptual questions about the status of the human but is generally reluctant to undertake a full study of their implications for a theory of subjectivity The inﬂ uence of Bruno Latours anti epistemology and antisubjectivity position accounts partly for this reluctance Concretely it results in parallel and non PostHumanism Life beyond the Self communicating lines of posthuman enquiry A new segrega tion of knowledge is produced along the dividing lines of the two cultures the Humanities and the Sciences which I will discuss in depth in chapter 4 For now let me stress that there is a posthuman agreement that contemporary science and biotechnologies affect the very ﬁ bre and structure of the living and have altered dramatically our understanding of what counts as the basic frame of refer ence for the human today Technological intervention upon all living matter creates a negative unity and mutual depend ence among humans and other species The Human Genome Project for instance uniﬁ es all the human species on the basis of a thorough grasp of our genetic structure This point of consensus however generates diverging paths of enquiry The Humanities continue to ask the question of the episte mological and political implications of the posthuman predicament for our understanding of the human subject They also raise deep anxieties both about the moral status of the human and express the political desire to resist commer cially owned and proﬁ tminded abuses of the new genetic knowhow Contemporary science and technology studies on the other hand adopt a different agenda They have developed an analytic form of posthuman theory For instance Franklin Lury and Stacey working within a sociocultural frame of reference refer to the technologically mediated world of today as panhumanity 2000 26 This indicates a global sense of interconnection among all humans but also between the human and the nonhuman environment including the urban social and political which creates a web of intricate interdependences This new panhumanity is paradoxical in two ways ﬁ rstly because a great deal of its interconnections are negative and based on a shared sense of vulnerability and fear of imminent catastrophes and secondly because this new global proximity does not always breed tolerance and peaceful coexistence on the contrary forms of xenophobic rejection of otherness and increasing armed violence are key features of our times as I will argue in chapter 3 Another relevant example of the same analytic posthuman thought within the disciplinary ﬁ eld of science studies is the work of sociologist Nicholas Rose 2007 He has written PostHumanism Life beyond the Self eloquently about the new forms of biosociality and bio citizenship that are emerging from the shared recognition of the biopolitical nature of contemporary subjectivity Resting on a Foucauldian understanding of how biopolitical man agement of Life deﬁ nes advanced capitalist economies today Rose has developed an effective empirically grounded analy sis of the dilemmas of the posthuman condition This posthu man analytic frame advocates a Foucauldian brand of neoKantian normativity I ﬁ nd this position quite helpful also because it defends a vision of the subject as a relational process with reference to the last phase of Foucaults work Foucault 1978 1985 1986 As I will argue in detail in the next chapter however the return to a notion of Kantian moral responsibility reinstates the individual at the core of the debate This is not compatible with the Foucauldian process ontology and creates both theoretical and practical contradictions that defeat the stated purpose of developing a posthuman approach Another signiﬁ cant case for analytic posthumanism is advocated by PeterPaul Verbeek 2011 Starting from the recognition of the intimate and productive association between human subjects and technological artefacts as well as the theoretical impossibility of keeping them apart Verbeek hints at the need for a postanthropological turn that links humans to nonhumans but he is also very careful not to trespass certain limits His analytic form of posthumanism is immediately qualiﬁ ed by a profoundly humanist and thus normative approach to technology itself Verbeeks main argument is that technologies contribute actively to how humans do ethics 2011 5 a revised and updated form of humanist ethics gets superimposed on posthumanist technologies In order to defend the humanist principle at the heart of contemporary technologies Verbeek emphasizes the moral nature of technological tools as agents that can guide human decision making on normative issues He also introduces multiple forms of machinic intentionality all of them indexed on nonhuman forms of moral consciousness Only by taking seriously the morality of things argues Verbeek can we hope to integrate our technology into the wider social community and bring a posthuman brand of Humanism into the twenty PostHumanism Life beyond the Self ﬁ rst century This results in shifting the location of traditional moral intentionality from autonomous transcendental con sciousness to the technological artefacts themselves The analytic posthumanism of science and technology studies is one of the most important elements of the contem porary posthuman landscape In terms of critical theories of the subject which is the focus of my position however this position falls wide of the mark because it introduces selected segments of humanistic values without addressing the contra dictions engendered by such a grafting exercise The pride in technological achievements and in the wealth that comes with them must not prevent us from seeing the great contradictions and the forms of social and moral inequality engendered by our advanced technologies Not addressing them in the name of either scientiﬁ c neutrality or of a hastily reconstructed sense of the panhuman bond induced by globalization simply begs the question In my eyes what is striking about the science and technol ogy studies approach whether it relies theoretically on moral philosophy or on sociocultural theory is the high degree of political neutrality it expresses about the posthuman predica ment Both Rose and Franklin et al for instance make it clear that the focus of their research is analytic and aims to achieve a better more thorough and in some ways intimate ethnographic understanding of how these new technologies actually function Science and technology studies tend to dismiss the implications of their positions for a revised vision of the subject Subjectivity is out of the picture and with it a sustained political analysis of the posthuman condition In my view a focus on subjectivity is necessary because this notion enables us to string together issues that are currently scattered across a number of domains For instance issues such as norms and values forms of community bonding and social belonging as well as questions of political governance both assume and require a notion of the subject Critical posthuman thought wants to reassemble a discursive com munity out of the different fragmented contemporary strands of posthumanism I cannot help noticing moreover a rather bizarre and highly problematic division of labour on the question of subjectivity between science and technology studies on the PostHumanism Life beyond the Self one hand and political analyses of advanced capitalism on the other For instance Hardt and Negri 2000 2004 or the Italian school of Lazzarato 2004 and Virno 2004 tend to avoid science and technology and not to treat it with anything like the depth and sophistication that they devote to the analysis of subjectivity I think we may need to review this segregation of discursive ﬁ elds and work towards a re integrated posthuman theory that includes both scientiﬁ c and technological complexity and its implications for political subjectivity political economy and forms of governance I will develop this project gradually in the chapters that follow There is another fundamental problem with the residual humanism of the analytically posthuman attempts to moral ize technology and sideline experiments with new forms of subjectivity namely their overconﬁ dence about the moral intentionality of the technology itself More speciﬁ cally they neglect the current state of autonomy reached by the machines The complexity of our smart technologies lies at the core of the postanthropocentric turn that will be the theme of the next chapter For now let us consider just one aspect of our technological smartness A recent issue of the weekly magazine The Economist 2 June 2012 on Morals and the machine raises some perti nent issues about the degree of autonomy reached by robots and calls for society to develop new rules to manage them The analysis is signiﬁ cant in contrast to the modernist idea of the robot as subservient to the human as exempliﬁ ed by Isaac Asimovs three laws of robotics formulated in 19427 we are now confronted by a new situation which makes 7 These three laws are 1 A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm 2 A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conﬂ ict with the First Law 3 A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conﬂ ict with the First or Second Laws These rules were set up by Isaac Asimov in a short story in 1942 and then reprinted in the world bestseller I Robot in 1950 They became foundational notions in cyberstudies Later Asimov added a fourth law which precedes all others 0 A robot may not harm humanity or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm PostHumanism Life beyond the Self human intervention rather peripheral if not completely irrel evant The Economist argues 2012 11 As robots become more autonomous the notion of computer controlled machines facing ethical decisions is moving out of the realm of science ﬁ ction and into the real world Most of these new robots are military in purpose and I will return to them in chapter 3 but many others are used for perfectly reasonable civilian purposes All of them share a crucial feature they have made it technologically feasible to bypass human decision making at both the operational and the moral levels According to this report humans will increasingly operate not in the loop but on the loop monitoring armed and working robots rather than fully controlling them Only ethical and legal issues remain to be solved to grant responsibility to autonomous machines deci sion making while the cognitive capacities are already in place As they become smarter and more widespread autono mous machines are bound to make lifeordeath decisions and thus assume agency Whether this high degree of autonomy however results in moral decision making is at best an open question Against claims to the inbuilt moral intentionality of the technology I would claim that it is normatively neutral Take some burning issues such as should an unmanned ﬂ ying vehicle also known as a drone ﬁ re on a house where a target is known to be hiding which also shelters civilians Should robots involved in disaster relief tell people the truth about their conditions thus causing panic and pain Such questions lead to the ﬁ eld of machine ethics which aims to give machines the ability to make such choices appropri ately in other words to tell right from wrong And who is to decide According to The Economist 2012 a new ethical approach needs to be developed by active experiments They should focus on three areas especially ﬁ rstly the rule of Laws to determine whether the designer the programmer the man ufacturer or the operator is at fault if a machine goes wrong To allocate responsibility a detailed logs system is needed so that it can explain the reasoning behind the decisionmaking process This has implications for design with a preference PostHumanism Life beyond the Self for systems that obey predeﬁ ned rules rather than decision making systems Secondly when ethical systems are embed ded in robots the judgements they make need to be ones that seem right to most people The techniques of experimental philosophy which studies how people respond to ethical dilemmas should be able to help Thirdly new interdiscipli nary collaboration is required between engineers ethicists lawyers and policymakers all of whom would draw up very different rules if left to their own devices They all stand to gain by working with each other What is posthuman about the situation outlined in The Economist is that it does not assume a human individualized self as the deciding factor of main subject It rather envisages what I would call a transversal interconnection or an assem blage of human and nonhuman actors not unlike Latours Actor Network Theory Law and Hassard 1999 It is sig niﬁ cant that a rather cautious and conservative journal like The Economist faced with the challenge of the posthuman powers of the technologies we have developed does not call for a return to humanist values but for pragmatic experimen tation This prompts three comments on my part ﬁ rstly that I could not agree more that this is no time for nostalgic long ings for the humanist past but for forwardlooking experi ments with new forms of subjectivity Secondly I want to emphasize the normatively neutral structure of contemporary technologies they are not endowed with intrinsic humanistic agency Thirdly I note that the advocates of advanced capital ism seem to be faster in grasping the creative potential of the posthuman than some of the wellmeaning and progressive neohumanist opponents of this system I will return in the next chapter to the opportunist brand of the posthuman developed in the contemporary market economy Critical Posthumanism The third strand of posthuman thought my own variation shows no conceptual or normative ambivalence towards posthumanism I want to move beyond analytic posthuman ism and develop afﬁ rmative perspectives on the posthuman subject My inspiration for taking the jump into critical post PostHumanism Life beyond the Self humanism comes from my antihumanist roots of course More speciﬁ cally the current of thought that has gone further in unfolding the productive potential of the posthuman predicament can be genealogically traced back to the post structuralists the antiuniversalism of feminism and the anti colonial phenomenology of Frantz Fanon 1967 and of his teacher Aimé Césaire 1955 What they have in common in a sustained commitment to work out the implications of posthumanism for our shared understandings of the human subject and of humanity as a whole The work of postcolonial and race theorists displays a situated cosmopolitan posthumanism that is supported as much by the European tradition as by nonWestern PostHumanism Life beyond the Self Humanism and that schooled in its abuses by the experience of Eurocentrism and empire one could fashion a different kind of Humanism that was cosmopolitan and textand language bound in ways that absorbed the great lessons of the past    and still remain attuned to the emergent voices and currents of the present many of them exilic extraterritorial and unhoused 2004 11 Fighting for such subaltern secular spaces is a priority for a posthuman quest for what is known in some quarters as a global ethic for global politics and economics Kung 1998 Paul Gilroys planetary cosmopolitanism 2000 also pro poses a productive form of contemporary critical posthuman ism Gilroy holds Europe and the Europeans accountable for our collective failure in implementing the ideals of the human ist Enlightenment Like the feminists race theorists are suspi cious of deconstructing a subjectposition which historically they never gained the right to Gilroy considers colonialism and fascism as a betrayal of the European ideal of the Enlight enment which he is determined to defend holding Europeans accountable for their ethical and political failings Racism splits common humanity and disengages whites from any ethical sensibility reducing them to an infrahuman moral status It also reduces nonwhites to a subhuman ontological status that exposes them to murderous violence Taking a strong stand against the return of fundamentalist appeals to ethnic differences by a variety of white black Serbian Rwandan Texan and other nationalists Gilroy denounces what Deleuze calls microfascisms Deleuze and Guattari 1987 as the epidemics of our globalized times He locates the site of the ethical transformation in the critique of each nationalistic category not in the assertion of a new dominant one He sets diasporic mobility and the transcultural inter connections up against the forces of nationalism This is a theory of mixture hybridity and cosmopolitanism that is resolutely nonracial Against the enduring power of nation states Gilroy posits instead the afﬁ rmative politics of trans versal movements such as antislavery feminism Médécins sans frontières and the like An altogether different and powerful source of inspiration for contemporary reconﬁ gurations of critical posthumanism PostHumanism Life beyond the Self is ecology and environmentalism They rest on an enlarged sense of interconnection between self and others including the nonhuman or earth others This practice of relating to others requires and is enhanced by the rejection of selfcen tred individualism It produces a new way of combining self interests with the wellbeing of an enlarged community based on environmental interconnections Environmental theory stresses the link between the human istic emphasis on Man as the measure of all things and the domination and exploitation of nature and condemns the abuses of science and technology Both of them involve epis temic and physical violence over the structural others and are related to the European Enlightenment ideal of reason The worldview which equated Mastery with rational scien tiﬁ c control over others also militated against the respect for the diversity of living matters and of human cultures Mies and Shiva 1993 The environmental alternative is a new holistic approach that combines cosmology with anthropol ogy and postsecular mostly feminist spirituality to assert the need for loving respect for diversity in both its human and nonhuman forms Signiﬁ cantly Shiva and Mies stress the importance of lifesustaining spirituality in this struggle for new concrete forms of universality a reverence for the sacred ness of life of deeply seated respect for all that lives This attitude is opposed to Western Humanism and to the Wests investment in rationality and secularity as the precondition for development through science and technology In a holistic perspective they call for the reenchantment of the world 1993 18 or for healing the Earth and that which has been so cruelly disconnected Instead of the emphasis on emancipa tion from the realm of natural necessity Shiva pleads for a form of emancipation that occurs within that realm and in harmony with it From this shift of perspective there follows a critique of the ideal of equality as the emulation of mascu line modes of behaviour and also the rejection of the model of development that is built upon this ideal and is compatible with worldwide forms of market domination Although ecological posthumanists like Shiva take great care to distance themselves from anything that is even remotely related to postmodernism postcolonialism or postfeminism paradoxically they share in the epistemic PostHumanism Life beyond the Self premises of posthuman critiques For instance they agree with the poststructuralist generation on the critique of the homogenization of cultures under the effects of globalized advanced capitalism They propose as an alternative a robust type of environmentalism based on nonWestern neohuman ism What matters for Mies and Shiva is the reassertion of the need for new universal values in the sense of intercon nectedness among humans on a worldwide scale Thus uni versal needs are amalgamated to universal rights and they cover as much basic and concrete necessities such as food shelter health safety as higher cultural needs like education identity dignity knowledge affection joy and care These constitute the material grounding of the situated claims to new ethical values A new ecological posthumanism thus raises issues of power and entitlement in the age of globalization and calls for self reﬂ exivity on the part of the subjects who occupy the former humanist centre but also those who dwell in one of the many scattered centres of power of advanced post modernity Grewal and Kaplan 1994 In my own work I deﬁ ne the critical posthuman subject within an ecophilosophy of multiple belongings as a rela tional subject constituted in and by multiplicity that is to say a subject that works across differences and is also internally differentiated but still grounded and accountable Posthu man subjectivity expresses an embodied and embedded and hence partial form of accountability based on a strong sense of collectivity relationality and hence community building My position is in favour of complexity and promotes radical posthuman subjectivity resting on the ethics of becom ing as we shall see in the next chapter The focus is shifted accordingly from unitary to nomadic subjectivity thus running against the grain of high humanism and its contem porary variations This view rejects individualism but also asserts an equally strong distance from relativism or nihilistic defeatism It promotes an ethical bond of an altogether dif ferent sort from the selfinterests of an individual subject as deﬁ ned along the canonical lines of classical Humanism A posthuman ethics for a nonunitary subject proposes an enlarged sense of interconnection between self and others including the nonhuman or earth others by removing the PostHumanism Life beyond the Self obstacle of selfcentred individualism As we saw earlier con temporary biogenetic capitalism generates a global form of reactive mutual interdependence of all living organisms including nonhumans This sort of unity tends to be of the negative kind as a shared form of vulnerability that is to say a global sense of interconnection between the human and the nonhuman environment in the face of common threats The posthuman recomposition of human interaction that I propose is not the same as the reactive bond of vulnerability but is an afﬁ rmative bond that locates the subject in the ﬂ ow of relations with multiple others As we shall see in the next chapter for me there is a neces sary link between critical posthumanism and the move beyond anthropocentrism I refer to this move as expanding the notion of Life towards the nonhuman or zoe This results in radical posthumanism as a position that transposes hybridity nomadism diasporas and creolization processes into means of regrounding claims to subjectivity connections and com munity among subjects of the human and the nonhuman kind This is the next step of the argument which I will outline in chapter 2 Conclusion This chapter has traced my own itinerary out of the multiple possible genealogies of the posthuman including the rise of alternative forms of critical posthumanism These new forma tions are postulated on the demise of that Man  the former measure of all things Eurocentrism masculinism and anthro pocentrism are exposed accordingly as complex and inter nally differentiated phenomena This alone is in keeping with the highly complex character of the concept of Humanism itself There are in fact many Humanisms and my own itiner ary generationally and geopolitically struggles essentially with one speciﬁ c genealogical line The romantic and positivistic Humanisms through which the European bourgeoisies established their hegemonies over modernity the revolutionary Humanism that shook the world and the liberal Humanism that sought to tame it the PostHumanism Life beyond the Self and opponents the antihumanist Humanism of Heidegger and the humanist antihumanism of Foucault and Althusser the secularist Humanism of Huxley and Dawkins or the post humanism of Gibson and Haraway Davies 1997 141 The fact that these different humanisms cannot be reduced to one linear narrative is part of the problem and the para doxes involved in attempting to overcome Humanism What seems absolutely clear to me is the historical ethical and political necessity to overcome this notion in the light of its history of unfulﬁ lled promises and unacknowledged brutality A key methodological and tactical measure to support this process is to practise the politics of location or situated and accountable knowledge practices Let me conclude with three crucial remarks ﬁ rstly that we do need a new theory of the subject that takes stock of the posthuman turn and hence acknowledges the decline of Humanism Secondly as shown by the proliferation of critical posthuman positions both within and outside the Western philosophical tradition the end of classical Humanism is not a crisis but entails positive consequences Thirdly advanced capitalism has been quick in sensing and exploiting the opportunities opened by the decline of western Humanism and the processes of cultural hybridization induced by glo balization I will address the latter in the next chapter so let me say something brieﬂ y about the other two points Firstly we need to work out the implications of the posthu man predicament in the sense of the decline of European Humanism in order to develop a robust foundation for ethical and political subjectivity The posthuman era is ripe with contradictions as we shall see in the next two chapters These call for ethical evaluation political intervention and norma tive action It follows therefore that the posthuman subject is not postmodern that is to say it is not antifoundationalist Nor is it deconstructivist because it is not linguistically framed The posthuman subjectivity I advocate is rather materialist and vitalist embodied and embedded ﬁ rmly located somewhere according to the feminist politics of loca tion which I have stressed throughout this chapter Why do I stress so much the issue of the subject Because a theory PostHumanism Life beyond the Self of subjectivity as both materialist and relational nature cultural and selforganizing is crucial in order to elaborate critical tools suited to the complexity and contradictions of our times A merely analytical form of posthuman thought does not go far enough More especially a serious concern for the subject allows us to take into account the elements of creativity and imagination desire hopes and aspirations Moore 2011 without which we simply cannot make sense of contemporary global culture and its posthuman overtones We need a vision of the subject that is worthy of the present This brings us to my second concluding remark the issue of Eurocentrism in terms of methodological nationalism Beck 2007 and its longstanding bond to Humanism Con temporary European subjects of knowledge must meet the ethical obligation to be accountable for their past history and the long shadow it casts on their presentday politics9 The new mission that Europe has to embrace entails the criticism of narrowminded selfinterests intolerance and xenophobic rejection of otherness Symbolic of the closure of the European mind is the fate of migrants refugees and asylumseekers who bear the brunt of racism in contempo rary Europe A new agenda needs to be set which is no longer that of European or Eurocentric universal rational subjectivity but rather a radical transformation of it in a break from Europes imperial fascistic and undemocratic tendencies As I stated earlier on in this chapter since the second half of the twen tieth century the crisis of philosophical Humanism  also known as the death of Man  both reﬂ ected and ampliﬁ ed larger concerns about the decline of the geopolitical status of Europe as an imperial worldpower Theory and world historical phenomena work in tandem when it comes to the question of European Humanism Because of this resonance between the two dimensions critical theory has a unique contribution to make to the debate on Europe I believe that the posthuman condition can facilitate the task of redeﬁ ning a new role for Europe in an age where global capitalism is both triumphant and clearly deﬁ cient in 9 As Morin 1987 Passerini 1998 Balibar 2004 and Bauman 2004 have also argued PostHumanism Life beyond the Self terms of sustainability and social justice Holland 2011 This hopeful belief rests on the postnationalist approach Habermas 2001 Braidotti 2006 which expresses the decline of Eurocentrism as a historical event and calls for a qualitative shift of perspective in our collective sense of iden tity Seyla Benhabib in her brilliant work on alternative cos mopolitanism 2007 addresses the question of Europe as a site of transformation Her emphasis on a pluralist cosmo politan practice and her commitment to the rights of refugees and stateless people as well as migrants innovates on clas sical universalist notions of cosmopolitanism and calls for situated and contextspeciﬁ c practices This resonates posi tively with my situated posthuman ethics A primary task for posthuman critical theory therefore is to draw accurate and precise cartographies for these different subject positions as springboards towards posthuman recompositions of a pan human cosmopolitan bond More speciﬁ cally I would like to push the case further than Habermas social democratic aspiration and argue for a post human project of becomingminoritarian or becoming nomad of Europe Deleuze and Guattari 1987 Braidotti 2008 This is a way of bypassing a number of binary pitfalls for instance between a globalized and culturally diverse Europe on the one hand and the narrow and xenophobic deﬁ nitions of European identity on the other The becoming nomad of Europe entails resistance against nationalism xen ophobia and racism bad habits of the old imperial Europe As such it is the opposite of the grandiose and aggressive universalism of the past which is replaced by a situated and accountable perspective It embraces a new political and ethical project by taking a ﬁ rm stand also against the For tress Europe syndrome and reviving tolerance as a tool of social justice Brown 2006 The posthuman turn can support and enhance this project in so far as it displaces the exclusive focus on the idea of Europe as the cradle of Humanism driven by a form of uni versalism that endows it with a unique sense of historical purpose The process of becomingminoritarian or becoming nomad of Europe involves the rejection of the selfappointed missionary role of Europe as the alleged centre of the world If it is the case that a sociocultural mutation is taking place PostHumanism Life beyond the Self in the direction of a multiethnic multimedia society then the transformation cannot affect only the pole of the others It must equally dislocate the position and the prerogative of the same the former centre The project of developing a new kind of postnationalist nomadic European identity is certainly challenging in that it requires disidentiﬁ cation from established nationbound identities This project is political at heart but it has a strong affective core made of convic tions vision and active desire for change We can collectively empower these alternative becomings My posthuman sensibility may come across as visionary and even impatient but it is very proactive or to use my favourite term afﬁ rmative Afﬁ rmative politics combines cri tique with creativity in the pursuit of alternative visions and projects As far as I am concerned the challenge of the post human condition consists in grabbing the opportunities offered by the decline of the unitary subject position upheld by Humanism which has mutated in a number of complex directions For instance the cultural intermixity already available within our postindustrial ethnoscapes and the re compositions of genders and sexualities sizzling under the apparently sedate image of equal opportunities far from being indicators of a crisis are productive events They are the new starting points that bring into play untapped possi bilities for bonding community building and empowerment Similarly the current scientiﬁ c revolution led by contempo rary biogenetic environmental neural and other sciences creates powerful alternatives to established practices and deﬁ nitions of subjectivity Instead of falling back on the sedimented habits of thought that the humanist past has institutionalized the posthuman predicament encourages us to undertake a leap forward into the complexities and para doxes of our times To meet this task new conceptual creativ ity is needed Chapter 2 PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species I loved George Eliots prose well before I even knew that she actually translated Spinoza my favourite philosopher into English Mary Evans was a woman of many talents and anyone who ever identiﬁ ed with Dorothea in Middlemarch 1973 or Maggie in The Mill on the Floss 2003 may not be cognitively aware of the fact that she stepped  surrepti tiously and fatally  into a monistic universe of intersecting affective relations that simply make the world go round George Eliot has authored my favourite sentence in the English language If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrels heart beat and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence As it is the quickest of us walk around well wadded with stupidity Eliot 1973 226 The roar which lies on the other side of the urbane civilized veneer that allows for bound identities and efﬁ cient social interaction is the Spinozist indicator of the raw cosmic energy that underscores the making of civilizations societies and their subjects Vitalist materialism is a concept that helps us make sense of that external dimension which in fact enfolds within the subject as the internalized score of cosmic vibra PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species tions Deleuze 1992 Deleuze and Guattari 1994 It also constitutes the core of a posthuman sensibility that aims at overcoming anthropocentrism Let me spell out some of these rather dense ideas A monis tic universe refers to Spinozas central concept that matter the world and humans are not dualistic entities structured according to principles of internal or external opposition The obvious target of criticism here is Descartes famous mind body distinction but for Spinoza the concept goes even further matter is one driven by the desire for selfexpression and ontologically free The absence of any reference to nega tivity and to violent dialectical oppositions caused intense criticism of Spinoza on the part of Hegel and the Marxist Hegelians Spinozas monistic worldview was seen as politi cally ineffective and holistic at heart This situation changed dramatically in the 1970s in France when a new wave of scholars rehabilitated Spinozist monism precisely as an antidote to some of the contradictions of Marxism and as a way of clarifying Hegels relationship to Marx1 The main idea is to overcome dialectical oppositions engendering non dialectical understandings of materialism itself Braidotti 1991 Cheah 2008 as an alternative to the Hegelian scheme The Spinozist legacy therefore consists in a very active concept of monism which allowed these modern French phi losophers to deﬁ ne matter as vital and selforganizing thereby producing the staggering combination of vitalist material ism Because this approach rejects all forms of transcenden talism it is also known as radical immanence Monism results in relocating difference outside the dialectical scheme as a complex process of differing which is framed by both internal and external forces and is based on the centrality of the relation to multiple others These monistic premises are for me the building blocks for a posthuman theory of subjectivity that does not rely on clas sical Humanism and carefully avoids anthropocentrism The 1 The group around Althusser started the debate in the mid1960s Deleuzes pathbreaking study of Spinoza dates from 1968 in English in 1990 Machereys HegelSpinoza analysis came out in 1979 in English in 2011 Negris work on the imagination in Spinoza in 1981 in English in 1991 PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species classical emphasis on the unity of all matter which is central to Spinoza is reinforced by an updated scientiﬁ c understand ing of the selforganizing or smart structure of living matter These ideas are supported by new advances in contemporary biosciences neural and cognitive sciences and by the infor matics sector Posthuman subjects are technologically medi ated to an unprecedented degree For instance a neoSpinozist approach is supported and expanded today by new develop ments in the mindbody interrelation within the neural sci ences Damasio 2003 In my view there is a direct connection between monism the unity of all living matter and post anthropocentrism as a general frame of reference for contem porary subjectivity Global Warning George Eliots work is a good lead into at least some aspects of this materialist or as I will argue later in the chapter matterrealist worldview The support is welcome as many of the assumptions and premises of the postanthropocentric universe are somewhat counter intuitive although the term has acquired widespread currency nowadays In mainstream public debates for instance the posthuman is usually coated in anxiety about the excesses of technological intervention and the threat of climate change or by elation about the potential for human enhancement In academic culture on the other hand the critique of anthropocentrism has even more shattering implications than the transformative agenda of posthumanism which I analysed in the previous chapter The postanthropocentric turn linked to the compounded impacts of globalization and of technologydriven forms of mediation strikes the human at hisher heart and shifts the parameters that used to deﬁ ne anthropos In this chapter I want to argue that the issue of the posthu man in relation to postanthropocentrism is of an altogether different order than in posthumanism For one thing whereas the latter mobilized primarily the disciplinary ﬁ eld of philoso phy history cultural studies and the classical Humanities in general the issue of postanthropocentrism enlists also science and technology studies new media and digital culture envi PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species ronmentalism and earthsciences biogenetics neuroscience and robotics evolutionary theory critical legal theory prima tology animal rights and science ﬁ ction This high degree of transdisciplinarity alone adds an extra layer of complexity to the issue The key question for me is what understandings of contemporary subjectivity and subjectformation are enabled by a postanthropocentric approach What comes after the anthropocentric subject How one reacts to this change of perspective depends to a large extent on ones relationship to technology Being rather technophilic myself I am quite upbeat I will always side ﬁ rmly with the liberatory and even transgressive poten tial of these technologies against those who attempt to index them to either a predictable conservative proﬁ le or to a proﬁ toriented system that fosters and inﬂ ates individualism I do think that one of the most pointed paradoxes of our era is precisely the tension between the urgency of ﬁ nding new and alternative modes of political and ethical agency for our technologically mediated world and the inertia of established mental habits on the other Donna Haraway put it with cus tomary wit the machines are so alive whereas the humans are so inert Haraway 1985 As if to mirror this science and technology studies nowadays is a thriving area in aca demic institutions whereas the Humanities are in serious trouble It may be useful to start by clarifying some aspects of the globalized context in which the decentring of anthropocen trism is taking place As I argued elsewhere Braidotti 2002 2006 advanced capitalism is a spinning machine that actively produces differences for the sake of commodiﬁ cation It is a multiplier of deterritorialized differences which are packaged and marketed under the labels of new dynamic and nego tiable identities and an endless choice of consumer goods This logic triggers a proliferation and a vampiric consump tion of quantitative options Many of them have to do with cultural others from fusion cooking to world music Jackie Stacey in her analysis of the new organic food industry Franklin et al 2000 argues that we literally eat the global economy Paul Gilroy 2000 and Celia Lury 1998 remind us that we also wear it listen to it and watch it on our many screens on a daily basis PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species The global circulation of goods data capital bits and bytes of information frames the interaction of contemporary subjects on a daily basis Multiple choices confront consum ers at every step but with varying degrees of actual freedom of choice Take for instance the transformations incurred by the formerly elementary task of making a call to the local bank What we have grown to expect nowadays is either an automated posthuman system of replies offering subsets of numbers that connect us to a further web of prerecorded messages Or else we welcome the relief of hearing a reallife human voice knowing all along that it is emanating from some call centre miles away in one of the emerging econo mies of the world The end result is that phone calls are cheaper than ever but the actual length of the calls is deﬁ nitely getting longer as the caller wades through multiple new hurdles Of course Internet communication is replacing all this but my point is that the spinning differential force of our economic system is such that we have to run twice as fast across automated replies or transcontinental phone lines just to stay in the same place The most salient trait of the contemporary global economy is therefore its technoscientiﬁ c structure It is built on the convergence between different and previously differentiated branches of technology notably the four horsemen of the posthuman apocalypse nanotechnology biotechnology information technology and cognitive science The biogenetic structure of contemporary capitalism is especially important and central to the discussion on the posthuman This aspect involves the Human Genome project stem cell research and biotechnological intervention upon animals seeds cells and plants In substance advanced capitalism both invests and proﬁ ts from the scientiﬁ c and economic control and the commodiﬁ cation of all that lives This context produces a paradoxical and rather opportunistic form of postanthropo centrism on the part of market forces which happily trade on Life itself The commodiﬁ cation of Life by biogenetic advanced capi talism however is a complex affair Consider my argument the great scientiﬁ c advances of molecular biology have taught us that matter is selforganized autopoietic whereas monis tic philosophy adds that it is also structurally relational and PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species hence connected to a variety of environments These insights combine in deﬁ ning intelligent vitality or selforganizing capacity as a force that is not conﬁ ned within feedback loops internal to the individual human self but is present in all living matter Why is matter so intelligent though Because it is driven by informational codes which both deploy their own bars of information and interact in multiple ways with the social psychic and ecological environments Guattari 2000 What happens to subjectivity in this complex ﬁ eld of forces and data ﬂ ows My argument is that it becomes an expanded relational self engendered by the cumulative effect of all these factors Braidotti 1991 2011a The relational capacity of the posthuman subject is not conﬁ ned within our species but it includes all nonanthropomorphic elements Living matter  including the ﬂ esh  is intelligent and self organizing but it is so precisely because it is not disconnected from the rest of organic life I therefore do not work com pletely within the social constructivist method but rather emphasize the nonhuman vital force of Life which is what I have coded as zoe Postanthropocentrism is marked by the emergence of the politics of life itself Rose 2007 Life far from being codi ﬁ ed as the exclusive property or the unalienable right of one species the human over all others or of being sacralized as a preestablished given is posited as process interactive and openended This vitalist approach to living matter displaces the boundary between the portion of life  both organic and discursive  that has traditionally been reserved for anthro pos that is to say bios and the wider scope of animal and nonhuman life also known as zoe Zoe as the dynamic self organizing structure of life itself Braidotti 2006 2011b stands for generative vitality It is the transversal force that cuts across and reconnects previously segregated species cat egories and domains Zoecentred egalitarianism is for me the core of the postanthropocentric turn it is a materialist secular grounded and unsentimental response to the oppor tunistic transspecies commodiﬁ cation of Life that is the logic of advanced capitalism It is also an afﬁ rmative reaction of social and cultural theory to the great advances made by the other culture that of the sciences The relationship between the two will be addressed in chapter 4 PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species A posthuman theory of the subject emerges therefore as an empirical project that aims at experimenting with what contemporary biotechnologically mediated bodies are capable of doing These nonproﬁ t experiments with contem porary subjectivity actualize the virtual possibilities of an expanded relational self that functions in a natureculture continuum and is technologically mediated Not surprisingly this nonproﬁ t experimental approach to different practices of subjectivity is not exactly the spirit of contemporary capitalism Under the cover of individualism fuelled by a quantitative range of consumer choices that system effectively promotes uniformity and conformism to the dominant ideology The perversity of advanced capital ism and its undeniable success consists in reattaching the potential for experimentation with new subject formations back to an overinﬂ ated notion of possessive individualism MacPherson 1962 tied to the proﬁ t principle This is pre cisely the opposite direction from the nonproﬁ t experimenta tions with intensity which I defend in my theory of posthuman subjectivity The opportunistic political economy of bio genetic capitalism turns Lifezoe  that is to say human and nonhuman intelligent matter  into a commodity for trade and proﬁ t What the neoliberal market forces are after and what they ﬁ nancially invest in is the informational power of living matter itself The capitalization of living matter produces a new political economy which Melinda Cooper 2008 calls Life as surplus It introduces discursive and material politi cal techniques of population control of a very different order from the administration of demographics which preoccu pied Foucaults work on biopolitical governmentality The warnings are now global Today we are undertaking risk analyses not only of entire social and national systems but also of whole sections of the population in the world risk society Beck 1999 Data banks of biogenetic neural and mediatic information about individuals are the true capital today as the success of Facebook demonstrates at a more banal level Datamining includes proﬁ ling practices that identify different types or characteristics and highlights them as special strategic targets for capital investments This kind of predictive analytics of the human amounts to Life PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species mining2 with visibility predictability and exportability as the key criteria Cooper sums up lucidly the complications of this political economy 2008 3 Where does reproduction end and technical invention begin when life is out to work at the microbiological or cellular level What is at stake in the extension of property law to cover everything from the molecular elements of life biologi cal patents to the biospheric accident catastrophe bonds What is the relationship between new theories of biological growth complexity and evolution and recent neoliberal theo ries of accumulation And how is it possible to counter these new dogmatisms without falling into the trap of neofunda mentalist politics of life the righttolife movement or ecologi cal survivalism for example It is signiﬁ cant to note the emphasis Cooper places on the risk of neofundamentalist positions like the biological deter minism of natural law advocates or ecological holism This essentialist risk is high in our current sociopolitical context and it requires constant critical scrutiny on the part of schol ars who start instead from the posthuman idea of the nature culture continuum Patricia Clough pursues a similar line in her analysis of the affective turn 2008 Because advanced capitalism reduces bodies to their informational substrate in terms of energy resources it levels out other categorical differences so that equivalencies might be found to value one form of life against another one vital capacity against another Clough 2008 17 What constitutes capital value in our social system is the accumulation of information itself its immanent vital quali ties and selforganizing capacity Clough provides an impres sive list of the concrete techniques employed by cognitive capitalism Moulier Boutang 2012 to test and monitor the capacities of affective or biomediated bodies DNA testing brain ﬁ ngerprinting neural imaging body heat detection and iris or hand recognition All these are also immediately opera tionalized as surveillance techniques both in civil society and in the war against terror This necropolitical governmentality is the topic of the next chapter 2 With thanks to Jose van Dijck for this formulation PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species For now let me stress my main point the opportunistic political economy of biogenetic capitalism induces if not the actual erasure at least the blurring of the distinction between the human and other species when it comes to proﬁ ting from them Seeds plants animals and bacteria ﬁ t into this logic of insatiable consumption alongside various specimens of humanity The image of Da Vincis Vitruvian Man on a Star bucks coffee cup see ﬁ gure 21 captures ironically the mer etricious character of the posthuman connections engendered by global capital I shop therefore I am may well be its motto The global economy is postanthropocentric in that it ulti mately uniﬁ es all species under the imperative of the market and its excesses threaten the sustainability of our planet as a whole A negative sort of cosmopolitan interconnection is therefore established through a panhuman bond of vulner ability The size of recent scholarship on the environmental Figure 21 Vitruvian Man on Starbucks Coffee Cup  Guardian News  Media Ltd 2011 PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species crisis and climate change alone testiﬁ es to this state of emer gency and to the emergence of the earth as a political agent Postanthropocentrism is especially thriving in popular culture and has been criticized Smelik and Lykke 2008 as a negative tendency to represent the transformations of the relations between humans and technological apparatus or machines in the mode of neogothic horror The literature and cinema of extinction of our and other species including disas ter movies is a successful genre of its own enjoying broad popular appeal I have labelled this narrow and negative social imaginary as technoteratological Braidotti 2002 that is to say as the object of cultural admiration and aber ration This dystopian reﬂ ection of the biogenetic structure of contemporary capitalism is crucial to explain the popular ity of this genre The social theory literature on shared anxiety about the future of both our species and of our humanist legacy is also rich and varied Important liberal thinkers like Habermas 2003 and inﬂ uential ones like Fukuyama 2002 are very alert on this issue as are social critics like Sloterdijk 2009 and Borradori 2003 In different ways they express deep concern for the status of the human and seem particularly struck by moral and cognitive panic at the prospect of the posthuman turn blaming our advanced technologies for it I share their concern but as a posthuman thinker with distinct antihumanist feelings I am less prone to panic at the pros pect of a displacement of the centrality of the human and can also see the advantages of such an evolution For instance once these postanthropocentric practices blur the qualitative lines of demarcation not only among categories malefemale blackwhite humananimal dead alive centremargin etc but also within each one of them the human becomes subsumed into global networks of control and commodiﬁ cation which have taken Life as the main target The generic ﬁ gure of the human is consequently in trouble Donna Haraway puts is as follows our authenticity is

by now that the standard which was posited in the universal mode of Man has been widely criticized Lloyd 1984 precisely because of its partiality Universal Man in fact is implicitly assumed to be masculine white urbanized speaking a standard language heterosexually inscribed in a reproductive unit and a full citizen of a recognized polity Irigaray 1985b Deleuze and Guattari 1987 How non representative can you get As if this line of criticism were not enough this Man is also called to task and brought back to its species speciﬁ city as anthropos Rabinow 2003 Esposito 2008 that is to say as the representative of a hier archical hegemonic and generally violent species whose cen trality is now challenged by a combination of scientiﬁ c advances and global economic concerns Massumi refers to this phenomenon as ExMan a genetic matrix embedded in the materiality of the human 1998 60 and as such undergoing signiﬁ cant mutations species integrity is lost in a biochemical mode expressing the mutability of human matter 1998 60 These analyses indicate in my view that the political economy of biogenetic capitalism is postanthropocentric in its very structures but not necessarily or automatically post humanistic It also tends to be deeply inhumane as we shall see in the next chapter The posthuman dimension of post anthropocentrism can consequently be seen as a deconstruc tive move What it deconstructs is species supremacy but it also inﬂ icts a blow to any lingering notion of human nature anthropos and bios as categorically distinct from the life of animals and nonhumans or zoe What comes to the fore instead is a natureculture continuum in the very embodied structure of the extended self as I argued earlier This shift can be seen as a sort of anthropological exodus from the dominant conﬁ gurations of the human as the king of creation Hardt and Negri 2000 215  a colossal hybridization of the species Once the centrality of anthropos is challenged a number of boundaries between Man and his others go tumbling PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species down in a cascade effect that opens up unexpected perspec tives Thus if the crisis of Humanism inaugurates the posthu man by empowering the sexualized and racialized human others to emancipate themselves from the dialectics of masterslave relations the crisis of anthropos relinquishes the demonic forces of the naturalized others Animals insects plants and the environment in fact the planet and the cosmos as a whole are called into play This places a different burden of responsibility on our species which is the primary cause for the mess The fact that our geological era is known as the anthropocene3 stresses both the technologically mediated power acquired by anthropos and its potentially lethal con sequences for everyone else Furthermore the transposition of naturalized others poses a number of conceptual and methodological complications linked to the critique of anthropocentrism This is due to the pragmatic fact that as embodied and embedded entities we are all part of nature even though academic philosophy con tinues to claim transcendental grounds for human conscious ness How to reconcile this materialist awareness with the task of critical thought As a brand of vital materialism posthuman theory contests the arrogance of anthropocen trism and the exceptionalism of the Human as a transcen dental category It strikes instead an alliance with the productive and immanent force of zoe or life in its non human aspects This requires a mutation of our shared under standing of what it means to think at all let alone think critically In the rest of this chapter I will develop this insight into a number of interrelated ﬁ elds of postanthropocentric enquiry My focus is on the productive aspects of the posthuman predicament and the extent to which it opens up perspectives for afﬁ rmative transformations of both the structures of sub jectivity and the production of theory and knowledge I have labelled these processes as becominganimal becomingearth and becomingmachine with reference to Deleuze and Guat taris philosophy though I am very independent in relation to them Thus the becominganimal axis of transformation in 2002 and has become widely accepted PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species entails the displacement of anthropocentrism and the recogni tion of trans species solidarity on the basis of our being environmentally based that is to say embodied embedded and in symbiosis with other species Margulis and Sagan 1995 The planetary or becomingearth dimension brings issues of environmental and social sustainability to the fore with special emphasis on ecology and the climate change issue The becomingmachine axis cracks open the division between humans and technological circuits introducing bio technologically mediated relations as foundational for the constitution the subject I will conclude by advancing an idea that will be central to chapter 4 namely that we need to apply the vitalist brand of matterrealism as the foundation for a system of ethical values where life stands central not only to the Life Sciences but also to the Humanities in the twenty ﬁ rst century Let us start by looking at each of these cases in turn The Posthuman as Becominganimal Postanthropocentrism displaces the notion of species hierar chy and of a single common standard for Man as the measure of all things In the ontological gap thus opened other species come galloping in This is easier done than said in the language and methodological conventions of critical theory Is language not the anthropological tool par excel lence We saw in the previous chapter that the humanist image of thought also sets the frame for a selfcongratulating relationship of Man to himself which conﬁ rms the dominant subject as much in what he includes as his core characteristics as in what he excludes as other The subject of Humanism makes an internally contradic tory claim in order to support his sovereign position He is simultaneously an abstract universal and very much the spokesman of an elite species both Human and anthropos This logically impossible claim rests on an assumed political anatomy according to which the counterpart of the power of reason is the notion of Man as rational animal As we saw in chapter 1 the latter is expected to inhabit a perfectly functional physical body implicitly modelled upon ideals of PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species white masculinity normality youth and health The dialectics of otherness is the inner engine of humanist Mans power who assigns difference on a hierarchical scale as a tool of governance All other modes of embodiment are cast out of the subject position and they include anthropomorphic others nonwhite nonmasculine nonnormal nonyoung non healthy disabled malformed or enhanced peoples They also cover more ontological categorical divides between Man and zoomorphic organic or earth others All these others are rendered as pejoration pathologized and cast out of normal ity on the side of anomaly deviance monstrosity and bestial ity This process is inherently anthropocentric gendered and racialized in that it upholds aesthetic and moral ideals based on white masculine heterosexual European civilization Let us look more closely at the mechanisms involved in the dialectics of negative difference from the angle of animals The animal is the necessary familiar and much cherished other of anthropos This familiarity however is fraught with perils In a brilliant mock taxonomy Louis Borges classiﬁ ed animals into three groups those we watch television with those we eat and those we are scared of These exceptionally high levels of lived familiarity conﬁ ne the humananimal interaction within classical parameters namely an oedipal ized relationship you and me together on the same sofa an instrumental thou shalt be consumed eventually and a fantasmatic one exotic extinct infotainment objects of titillation Let us now analyse brieﬂ y each of these The oedipal rela tionship between humans and animals is unequal and framed by the dominant human and structurally masculine habit of taking for granted free access to and the consumption of the bodies of others animals included As a mode of relation it is therefore neurotic in that it is saturated with projections taboos and fantasies It is also a token of the human subjects sense of supreme ontological entitlement Derrida referred to the power of the human species over animals in terms of carnophallogocentrism Derrida 2006 and criticized it as an example of epistemic and material violence In their com mentary Berger and Segarra 2011 argue that Derridas work on animality is not peripheral but quite central to his analysis of the limits of the Enlightenment project Derridas PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species necessary correlate of the critique of Humanism The strong logical and historical connection between them frames a political critique of the damage inﬂ icted by Western reason upon its multiple others The recognition of shared ties of vulnerability can generate new forms of posthuman commu nity and compassion Pick 2011 This familiar oedipalized and hence ambivalent and manipulative relationship between humans and animals expressed itself in a variety of ways that have become entrenched in our mental and cultural habits The ﬁ rst is metaphorization Animals have long spelled out the social grammar of virtues and moral distinctions for the beneﬁ t of humans This normative function was canonized in moral glossaries and cognitive bestiaries that turned animals into metaphorical referents for norms and values Just think of the illustrious literary pedigree of the noble eagles the deceitful foxes the humble lambs and the crickets and bees that Livy and Moliere have immortalized These metaphorical habits feed into the fantasmatic dimension of humananimal interaction which in contemporary culture is best expressed by the entertain ment value of nonanthropomorphic characters ranging from King Kong to the hybrid blue creatures of Avatar without forgetting Spielbergs Jurassic Park stardinosaurs At the social level the evidence for new humananimal interaction is strong and often it comes down to questions of representation Companion species as Haraway put it 2003 have been historically conﬁ ned within infantilizing narratives that established affective kinship relations across the species The most dominant spinoff of this narrative is the sentimental discourse about dogs devotion and uncondi tional loyalty which Haraway argues against with all her mighty passion As a nature cultural compound a dog  not unlike other products of techno science  is a radical other albeit a signiﬁ cant other It is as socially constructed as most humans not only through genetic screening but also via health and hygiene regulations and various grooming prac tices Who has not struggled to suppress a giggle of recogni tion at the news of the success of pets diet clinics in the glamorous suburbs of LA Some surprising forms of material equivalence are found among different lifeforms in these PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species posthuman days We need to devise therefore a system of representation that matches the complexity of contemporary nonhuman animals and their proximity to humans The point now is to move towards a new mode of relation animals are no longer the signifying system that props up the humans selfprojections and moral aspirations They need to be approached in a neoliteral mode as a code system or a zoontology of their own Wolfe 2003 The second major manifestation of the problematic and contradictory familiarity between humans and animals is linked to the market economy and labour force Since antiq uity animals have constituted a sort of zooproletariat in a species hierarchy run by the humans They have been exploited for hard labour as natural slaves and logistical supports for humans prior to and throughout the mechanical age They constitute moreover an industrial resource in themselves animal bodies being primary material products starting from milk and their edible meat but think also of the tusks of elephants the hides of most creatures the wool of sheep the oil and fat of whales the silk of caterpillars etc As indicated by the ﬁ gures I presented in the second vignette of the general introduction this political economy of fullscale discursive and material exploitation continues today with animals providing living material for scientiﬁ c experiment for our biotechnological agriculture the cosmet ics industry drugs and pharmaceutical industries and other sectors of the economy Animals like pigs and mice are geneti cally modiﬁ ed to produce organs for humans in xenotrans plantation experiments Using animals as test cases and cloning them is now an established scientiﬁ c practice Onco mouse and Dolly the sheep are already part of history Haraway 1997 Franklin 2007 In advanced capitalism animals of all categories and species have been turned into tradable disposable bodies inscribed in a global market of postanthropocentric exploitation As I said earlier trafﬁ c in animals constitutes the third largest illegal trade in the world today after drugs and arms but ahead of women This creates a new negative bond between humans and animals At the height of the Cold War when dogs and monkeys were being launched into orbit as part of the budding space exploration programmes and escalating competition between PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species the USA and the USSR George Orwell ironically stated that all animals are equal but some are more equal than others Orwell 1946 At the dawn of the third millennium in a world caught in indeﬁ nite and technologically mediated warfare such metaphorical grandeur rings rather hollow Postanthropocentrism rather suggests the opposite no animal is more equal than any other because they are all equally inscribed in a market economy of planetary exchanges that commodiﬁ es them to a comparable degree and therefore makes them equally disposable All other distinctions are blurred At the same time the old mode of relation is currently being restructured A zoeegalitarian turn is taking place that encourages us to engage in a more equitable relationship with animals Contemporary postanthropocentric thought pro duces an antiOedipal animality within a fastchanging technoculture that engenders mutations at all levels In my view the challenge today is how to deterritorialize or noma dize the humananimal interaction so as to bypass the metaphysics of substance and its corollary the dialectics of otherness This also entails secularizing accordingly the concept of human nature and the life which animates it Donna Haraway a pioneer in postanthropocentric thought and shrewd analyst of humananimal interaction captured this fundamental shift in the ironical cartoons that depict companion species in the Vitruvian pose see ﬁ gures 22 and 23 Can a cat or a dog be the measure of at least some if not exactly all things Can it displace the genomic hierarchy that tacitly supported the humanists selfrepresentation Here we see the contradictory effects of the postanthropo centric politics of life itself which I commented on earlier in the chapter The posthuman in the sense of postanthropocentrism dis places the dialectical scheme of opposition replacing well established dualisms with the recognition of deep zoeegalitarianism between humans and animals The vitality of their bond is based on sharing this planet territory or environment on terms that are no longer so clearly hierarchi cal nor selfevident This vital interconnection posits a quali tative shift of the relationship away from speciesism and towards an ethical appreciation of what bodies human PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species Figure 22 S Harris Leonardo Da Vincis Dog Source wwwcartoonstockcom animal others can do An ethology of forces based on Spi nozist ethics emerges as the main point of reference for chang ing humananimal interaction It traces a new political frame which I see as an afﬁ rmative project in response to the com modiﬁ cation of Life in all its forms that is the opportunistic logic of advanced capitalism This postanthropocentric approach requires more efforts of our imagination to ground our representations in reallife PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species conditions and in an afﬁ rmative manner In this respect we need to rethink dogs cats and other sofabased companions today as cutting across species partitions not only affectively but also organically so to speak As naturecultural com pounds these animals qualify as cyborgs that is to say as creatures of mixity or vectors of posthuman relationality In Figure 23 Maggie Stiefvater Vitruvian Cat Source Maggie Stiefvater via Flickr PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species many ways Dolly the sheep is the ideal ﬁ guration for the complex biomediated temporalities and forms of intimacy that represent the new postanthropocentric humananimal interaction Sheit is simultaneously the last specimen of her species  descended from the lineage of sheep that were con ceived and reproduced as such  and the ﬁ rst specimen of a new species the electronic sheep that Philip K Dick dreamed of the forerunner of the androids society of Blade Runner 1982 Cloned not conceived sexually heterogeneous mix of organism and machine Dolly has become delinked from reproduction and hence divorced from descent Dolly is no daughter of any member of herits old species  simultane ously orphan and mother of heritself First of a new gender sheit is also beyond the gender dichotomies of the patriarchal kinship system A copy made in the absence of one single original Dolly pushes the logic of the postmodern simulacrum to its ultimate perversion Sheit spins Immaculate Conception into a bio genetic thirdcentury version The irony reaches a pathetic peak when we remember that Dolly died of a banal and all too familiar disease rheumatism After which to add insult to injury she suffered a last indignity taxidermy and was embalmed and exhibited in a science museum as a scientiﬁ c rarity Sheit simultaneously inhabits the nineteenth century and as a media celebrity also strikes a chord with the twentieth century Both archaic and hypermodern Dolly is a compound of multiple anachronisms situated across different chronological axes Sheit inhabits complex and selfcontradictory time zones Like other contemporary technoteratological animals or entities oncomouse comes to mind Dolly shatters the linearity of time and exists in a continuous present This technoelectronic timeless time is saturated with asynchronicity that is to say it is structurally unhinged Thinking about Dolly blurs the categories of thought we have inherited from the past  sheit stretches the longitude and latitude of thought itself adding depth intensity and con tradiction Because sheit embodies complexity this entity which is no longer an animal but not yet fully a machine is the icon of the posthuman condition Haraway also stresses the need for new images visions and representations of the humananimal continuum She pro PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species poses to start rethinking humananimal interaction from the hybrid ﬁ guration of oncomouse As the ﬁ rst patented animal in the world a transgenic organism created for the purposes of research the oncomouse is posthuman in every possible sense of the term It has been created for the purpose of proﬁ tmaking trafﬁ cking between the laboratories and the marketplace and thus navigates between patenting ofﬁ ces and the research benches Haraway wants to establish a sense of kinship with this transgenic animal Calling her my sibling    male or female she is my sister 1997 79 Haraway stresses the extent to which oncomouse is both a victim and a scapegoat a Christlike ﬁ gure that sacriﬁ ces herself in order to ﬁ nd the cure for breast cancer and thus save the lives of many women a mammal rescuing other mammals Because the oncomouse breaks the purity of lineage she is also a spectral ﬁ gure Not unlike Dolly it is the never dead that pollutes the natural order simply by being manufactured and not born She is a cyberteratological apparatus that scram bles the established codes and thus destabilizes but also reconstructs the posthuman subject Figurations like Dolly and oncomouse are no metaphors but rather vehicles to imaginatively ground our powers of understanding within the shifting landscapes of the present4 I am quite aware that my cheerful endorsement of the postanthropocentric turn may appear as overenthusiastic and even triumphalist to some Moore 2011 As I said in the previous chapter ones relation to the posthuman is affected in the ﬁ rst place by ones critical assessment of the human My deepseated antihumanist leanings show in the glee with which I welcome the displacement of anthropos My posthuman enthusiasm however does not blind me to the cruel contradictions and the power differences at work in contemporary humananimal interaction The old patterns of instrumental behaviour are still operative of course with animals being used for food wool and skin products labour in agriculture industry and science If anything the necro political economy is exacerbated by the global conﬂ icts and 4 In this regard these ﬁ gurations fulﬁ l the same function as Deleuzes conceptual personae Deleuze and Guattari 1994 Braidotti 2011a 2011b PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species by the ﬁ nancial crisis In so far as advanced capitalism markets and proﬁ ts from the biogenetic structures of life itself it contributes to the displacement of anthropocentrism Animals are caught in a double bind on the one hand they are more than ever the object of inhumane exploitation on the other hand they beneﬁ t from residual forms of reparative human ization This conﬂ icting situation leads me to conclude that postanthropocentrism is for both humans and animals a mixed blessing Allow me to explain Compensatory Humanism Throughout the second half of the twentieth century the issue of animal rights has gathered momentum in most advanced liberal democracies Political parties devoted entirely to the wellbeing of nonanthropocentric others  Green or Animal parties  sit in many Northern European parliaments They rest on the critique of speciesism that is to say the anthro pocentric arrogance of Man as the dominant species whose sense of entitlement includes access to the body of all others Animal rights activists defend the end of anthropolatry the assumption of human superiority and call for more respect and priority to be given to the interests of other species and life forms In animal rights theory these postanthropocentric ana lytic premises are combined with neohumanism to reassess the validity of a number of humanist values These concern anthropomorphic selves who are assumed to hold unitary identity selfreﬂ exive consciousness moral rationality and the capacity to share emotions like empathy and solidarity The same virtues and capabilities are also attributed to non anthropomorphic others The epistemological and moral assumptions that underscore this position have been in place since the Enlightenment but were previously reserved for humans only to the detriment of all nonhuman agents such as animals and plants Animal rights people whom I deﬁ ne as postanthropocentric neohumanists converge on the need to uphold and expand on these values across all species The best known champion of animal rights Peter Singer defends a utilitarian position in favour of the moral rational PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species ism of animals A liberal humanist like Nussbaum 2006 agrees to pursue species equity Working within the classical liberal tradition Mary Midgley 1996 does not even trust the term anthropocentrism referring to it as human chau vinism narrowness of sympathy comparable to national or race or genderchauvinism It could also be called exclusive humanism as opposed to the hospitable friendly inclusive kind 1996 105 The alternative Midgley supports is to admit that we are not selfcontained and selfsufﬁ cient either as a species or as individuals but live naturally in deep mutual dependence 1996 910 In her powerful analyses of the environmental crisis of reason Val Plumwood 2003 also calls for a new dialogical interspecies ethics based on decentring human privilege For radical ecofeminists both utilitarianism and liberal ism are found wanting the former for its condescending approach to nonhuman others the latter in view of the hypocritical denial of humans manipulative mastery over animals This critique is expanded to the destructive side of human individualism that entails selﬁ shness and a misplaced sense of superiority which for feminists Donovan and Adams 1996 2007 is connected to male privileges and the oppression of women and supports a general theory of male domination Meateating is targeted as a legalized form of cannibalism by old and new feminist vegetarian and vegan critical theory Adams 1990 MacCormack 2012 Species ism is therefore held accountable as an undue privilege to the same degree as sexism and racism The pervasiveness of a sexspecies hierarchical system tends to remain unacknowl edged and uncriticized even in the framework of animal rights activism The corrective inﬂ uence of feminism is valued because it emphasizes both the political importance of the collectivity and of emotional bonding New analytic data on the status of animals is currently being analysed through the interdisciplinary tools of anthro pology primatology palaeontology science and technology studies One of the most prominent postanthropocentric neohumanists in this ﬁ eld is Frans de Waal 1996 who extends classical humanist values like empathy and moral responsibility to the upper primates On the basis of rigorous empirical observation of the great apes de Waal transformed PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species our thinking about evolution and evolutionary psychology by challenging the emphasis on aggression as the motor of species development De Waals groundbreaking work on our inner ape and the bonobos located communication and sexual exchange at the core of community formation striking also a note in support of the evolutionary role of the females of species In his more recent work de Waal 2009 stresses the importance of empathy as a form of emotional commu nication or emotionally mediated communication among nonhuman primates The emphasis on empathy accomplishes several signiﬁ cant goals in view of a posthuman theory of subjectivity Firstly it reappraises communication as an evolutionary tool Sec ondly it identiﬁ es in emotions rather than in reason the key to consciousness Thirdly it develops what Harry Kunneman has deﬁ ned as a hermeneutical form of naturalism which takes critical distance from the tradition of social constructiv ism and situates moral values as innate qualities This is a signiﬁ cant addition to the theory of the natureculture con tinuum Our species argues de Waal is obligatorily gregari ous 2006 4 Moreover de Waals view of the subject is materialist as opposed to the transcendence of reason and attracted to David Humes approach to the emotions or pas sions as key to identity formation Last but not least I would suggest that Frans de Waal is a postanthropocentric social democrat who is very committed to the creation of social infrastructures of generosity and reciprocal altruism and support His idea that moral goodness is contagious is sup ported by the mirror neurons theory of empathy The emphasis falls on the ethical continuity between humans and upper primates arguing that it is a bit too easy to project our aggressive tendencies onto the animals and reserve the quality of goodness as a prerogative of our species De Waal 1996 argues that evolution has also provided the requisites for morality and attacks the anthropodenial 2006 xvi of human supremacists Empathy as an innate and genetically transmitted moral tendency or the naturalization of morals is in fashion whereas selﬁ sh genes and greed are deﬁ nitely out All these aspects are extremely relevant for a posthuman theory of the subject The reason why I am somewhat sceptical of postanthro pocentric neohumanism however is that it is rather uncriti PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species cal about Humanism itself The compensatory efforts on behalf of animals generate what I consider as a belated kind of solidarity between the human dwellers of this planet cur rently traumatized by globalization technology and the new wars and their animal others It is at best an ambivalent phenomenon in that it combines a negative sense of cross species bonding with classical and rather highminded human ist moral claims In this crossspecies embrace Humanism is actually being reinstated uncritically under the aegis of species egalitarianism In my work on the posthuman subject I choose not to leave aside the critical acknowledgement of the limitations of Humanism as outlined in the previous chapter I am also sharply aware of the fact that we live in the era of the anthro pocene that is to say an age when the earths ecological balance is directly regulated by humanity I think that at such a time of deep epistemological ethical and political crises of values in human societies extending the privileges of human ist values to other categories can hardly be considered as a selﬂ ess and generous or a particularly productive move Asserting a vital bond between the humans and other species is both necessary and ﬁ ne This bond is negative in that it is the effect of shared vulnerability which is itself a consequence of human actions upon the environment Is it not the case then that the humans have spread to nonhumans their fun damental anxiety about the future The humanization of nonhuman animals may therefore come at a price especially at a historical time when the very category of the human has become challenged Anthropomorphizing them so as to extend to animals the principle of moral and legal equality may be a noble gesture but it is inherently ﬂ awed on two scores Firstly it conﬁ rms the binary distinction humananimal by benevolently extend ing the hegemonic category the human towards the others Secondly it denies the speciﬁ city of animals altogether because it uniformly takes them as emblems of the trans species universal ethical value of empathy In my view the point about posthuman relations however is to see the inter relation humananimal as constitutive of the identity of each It is a transformative or symbiotic relation that hybridizes and alters the nature of each one and foregrounds the middle grounds of their interaction This is the milieu of the human PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species nonhuman continuum and it needs to be explored as an open experiment not as a foregone moral conclusion about alleg edly universal values or qualities The middle ground of that particular interaction has to remain normatively neutral in order to allow for new parameters to emerge for the becom inganimal of anthropos a subject that has been encased for much too long in the mould of species supremacy Intensive spaces of becoming have to be opened and more importantly to be kept open In an era when natural offspring are being replaced by corporate brands and manufactured and patented bio products the ethical imperative to bind to them and be accountable for their wellbeing remains as strong as ever We need new genealogies alternative theoretical and legal repre sentations of the new kinship system and adequate narratives to live up to this challenge I hope my vision of posthuman subjectivity can insert more conceptual creativity into critical theory and thus work towards an afﬁ rmative brand of post human thought In the universe that I inhabit as a post industrial subject of socalled advanced capitalism there is a great deal of familiarity and hence much in common in the way of embodied and embedded locations between female humans oncomouse and the cloned sheep Dolly I owe as much to the genetically engineered members of the former animal kingdom as to humanistic ideals of the uniqueness of my species Similarly my situated position as a female of the species makes me structurally serviceable and thus closer to the organisms that are willing or unwilling providers of organs or cells than to any notion of the inviolability and integrity of the human species I know that this may sound impatient and even reckless but I stand by it that in me which no longer identiﬁ es with the dominant categories of subjectivity but which is not yet completely out of the cage of identity that is to say that which goes on differing is at home with zoe the postanthropocen tric subject These rebellious components for me are related to the feminist consciousness of what it means to be embod ied female As such I am a shewolf a breeder that multiplies cells in all directions I am an incubator and a carrier of vital and lethal viruses I am motherearth the generator of the future In the political economy of phallogocentrism and of PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species anthropocentric humanism which predicates the sovereignty of Sameness in a falsely universalistic mode my sex fell on the side of Otherness understood as pejorative difference or as beingworthlessthan The becomingposthuman speaks to my feminist self partly because my sex historically speak ing never quite made it into full humanity so my allegiance to that category is at best negotiable and never to be taken for granted The Posthuman as Becomingearth The displacement of anthropocentrism results in a drastic restructuring of humans relation to animals but critical theory may be able to adjust itself to the challenge mostly by building on the multiple imaginary and affective ties that have consolidated humananimal interaction The post anthropocentric shift towards a planetary geocentred per spective however is a conceptual earthquake of an altogether different scale than the becominganimal of Man This event is sending seismic waves across the ﬁ eld of the Humanities and critical theory Claire Colebrook with her customary wit calls it a critical climate change5 In the age of anthropocene the phenomenon known as geomorphism is usually expressed in negative terms as environmental crisis climate change and ecological sustain ability Yet there is also a more positive dimension to it in the sense of reconﬁ guring the relationship to our complex habitat which we used to call nature The earth or planetary dimension of the environmental issue is indeed not a concern like any other It is rather the issue that is immanent to all others in so far as the earth is our middle and common ground This is the milieu for all of us human and non human inhabitant of this particular planet in this particular era The planetary opens onto the cosmic in an immanent materialist dimension My argument is that again this change of perspective is rich in alternatives for a renewal of subjectiv ity What would a geocentred subject look like 5 This is the title of the online book series that Colebrook edits for the Open Humanities Press PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species The starting point for me remains the natureculture con tinuum but by now we need to insert into this framework the monistic insight that as Lloyd put it we are all part of nature 1994 This statement which she frames in a monis tic ontology based on Spinozas philosophy is sobering as well as inspiring It is further complicated for us citizens of the third millennium by the fact that we actually inhabit a natureculture continuum which is both technologically mediated and globally enforced This means that we cannot assume a theory of subjectivity that takes for granted natu ralistic foundationalism nor can we rely on a social construc tivist and hence dualistic theory of the subject which disavows the ecological dimension Instead critical theory needs to fulﬁ l potentially contradictory requirements The ﬁ rst is to develop a dynamic and sustainable notion of vitalist selforganizing materiality the second is to enlarge the frame and scope of subjectivity along the transversal lines of postanthropocentric relations I outlined in the previous section The idea of subjectivity as an assemblage that includes nonhuman agents has a number of consequences Firstly it implies that subjectivity is not the exclusive prerogative of anthropos secondly that it is not linked to transcendental reason thirdly that it is unhinged from the dialectics of rec ognition and lastly that it is based on the immanence of relations The challenge for critical theory is momentous we need to visualize the subject as a transversal entity encom passing the human our genetic neighbours the animals and the earth as a whole and to do so within an understandable language Let us pause on the latter for a minute as it raises the issue of representation which is crucial for the Humanities and for critical theory Finding an adequate language for postanthropocentrism means that the resources of the imag ination as well as the tools of critical intelligence need to be enlisted for this task The collapse of the natureculture divide requires that we need to devise a new vocabulary with new ﬁ gurations to refer to the elements of our posthuman embodied and embedded subjectivity The limitations of the social constructivist method show up here and need to be compensated by more conceptual creativity Most of us who were trained in social theory however have experienced at PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species elements of our subjectivity may not be totally socially con structed Part of the legacy of the Marxist Left consists in fact in a deeply rooted suspicion towards the natural order and green politics As if this mistrust of the natural were not enough we also need to reconceptualize the relation to the technological arte fact as something as intimate as close as nature used to be The technological apparatus is our new milieu and this intimacy is far more complex and generative than the pros thetic mechanical extension that modernity had made of it Throughout this change of parameters I also want to be ever mindful of the importance of the politics of locations and keep investigating who exactly is the we who is positing all these queries in the ﬁ rst place This new scheme for rethinking posthuman subjectivity is as rich as it is complex but it is grounded in reallife worldhistorical conditions that are confronting us with pressing urgency Dipesh Chakrabarty 2009 addresses some of these con cerns by investigating the consequences of the climate change debate for the practice of history He argues that the scholar ship on climate change causes both spatial and temporal difﬁ culties It brings about a change of scale in our thinking which now needs to encompass a planetary or geocentred dimension acknowledging that humans are larger than a biological entity and now wield a geological force It also shifts the temporal parameters away from the expectation of continuity which sustains the discipline of history to contem plate the idea of extinction that is to say a future without us Furthermore these shifts in the basic parameters also affect the content of historical research by destroying the artiﬁ cial but time honoured distinction between natural and human histories Chakrabarty 2009 206 Although Chakrabarty does not take the postanthropocentric path he comes to the same conclusion as I do the issue of geocentred perspectives and the change of location of humans from mere biological to geological agents calls for recompositions of both subjectivity and community The geocentred turn also has other serious political impli cations The ﬁ rst concerns the limitations of classical Human ism in the Enlightenment model Relying on postcolonial PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species theory Chakrabarty points out that the philosophers of freedom were mainly and understandably concerned with how humans would escape the injustice oppression inequal ity or even uniformity foisted on them by other humans or humanmade systems 2009 208 Their anthropocentrism coupled with a culturespeciﬁ c notion of Humanism limits their relevance today The climate change issue and the spectre of human extinction also affect the analytic strategies that postcolonial and postimperial historians have deployed in the last two decades in response to the postwar scenario of decol onization and globalization Chakrabarty 2009 198 I would add that the social constructivist approach of Marxist feminist and postcolonial analyses does not completely equip them to deal with the change of spatial and temporal scale engendered by the postanthropocentric or geocentred shift This insight is the core of the radical postanthropocentric position I want to defend which I see as a way of updating critical theory for the third millennium Many scholars are coming to the same conclusion through different routes For instance postanthropocentric neo humanist traditions of socialist or of standpoint feminist theories Harding 1986 and of postcolonial theory Shiva 1997 have approached the issues of environmentalism in a postanthropocentric or at least nonandrocentric or non maledominated manner as we saw in the previous chapter This critique of anthropocentrism is expressed in the name of ecological awareness with strong emphasis on the experi ence of social minorities like women and of nonWestern peoples The recognition of multicultural perspectives and the critique of imperialism and ethnocentrism add a crucial aspect to the discussion on the becomingearth but nowadays they also fall in their own internal contradictions Let us take for instance the case of deep ecology Arne Naess 1977a 1977b and James Lovelocks Gaia hypoth esis 1979 are geocentred theories that propose a return to holism and to the notion of the whole earth as a single sacred organism This holistic approach is rich in perspectives but also quite problematic for a vitalist materialist posthuman thinker What is problematic about it is less the holistic part than the fact that it is based on a social constructivist dualistic method This means that it opposes the earth to industrializa PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species tion nature to culture the environment to society and comes down ﬁ rmly on the side of the natural order This results in a relevant political agenda that is critical of consumerism and possessive individualism including a strong indictment of technocratic reason and technological culture But this approach has two drawbacks Firstly its technophobic aspect is not particularly helpful in itself considering the world we are living in Secondly it paradoxically reinstates the very categorical divide between the natural and the manufactured which it is attempting to overcome Why do I not agree with this position Because of two interrelated ideas ﬁ rstly because of the natureculture con tinuum and the subsequent rejection of the dualistic method ology of social constructivism  the postanthropocentric neohumanists end up reinstating this distinction albeit with the best of intentions in relation to the natural order sec ondly because I am suspicious of the negative kind of bonding going on in the age of anthropocene between humans and nonhumans The transspecies embrace is based on the awareness of the impending catastrophe the environmental crisis and the global warmning issue not to speak of the militarization of space reduce all species to a comparable degree of vulnerability The problem with this position is that in ﬂ agrant contradiction with its explicitly stated aims it promotes fullscale humanization of the environment This strikes me as a regressive move reminiscent of the sentimen tality of the Romantic phases of European culture I concur therefore with Val Plumwoods 1993 2003 assessment that deep ecology misreads the earthcosmos nexus and merely expands the structures of possessive egoism and selfinterests to include nonhuman agents Signiﬁ cantly while the holistic approach also makes refer ence to Spinozas monism it steers clear of contemporary rereadings of Spinoza by the likes of Deleuze and Guattari Foucault or other radical branches of Continental philoso phy Spinozas idea of the unity of mind and soul is applied in support of the belief that all that lives is holy and the greatest respect is due to it This idolatry of the natural order is linked to Spinozas vision of God and the unity between man and nature It stresses the harmony between the human and the ecological habitat in order to propose a sort of syn PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species thesis of the two Deep ecology is therefore spiritually charged in an essentialist way Because there are no boundaries and everything is interrelated to hurt nature is ultimately to hurt ourselves Thus the earth environment as a whole deserves the same ethical and political consideration as humans This position is helpful but it strikes me as a way of humanizing the environment that is to say as a wellmeaning form of residual anthropomorphic normativity applied to nonhuman planetary agents Compensatory Humanism is a twofaced position In contrast with this position but also building on some of its premises I would like to propose an updated brand of Spinozism Citton and Lordon 2008 I see Spinozist monism and the radical immanent forms of critique that rest upon it as a democratic move that promotes a kind of ontological paciﬁ sm Species equality in a postanthropocentric world does urge us to question the violence and the hierarchical thinking that result from human arrogance and the assump tion of transcendental human exceptionalism In my view monistic relationality stresses instead the more compassion ate aspect of subjectivity A Spinozist approach reread with Deleuze and Guattari allows us to bypass the pitfalls of binary thinking and to address the environmental question in its full complexity Contemporary monism implies a notion of vital and selforganizing matter as we saw in the previous chapter as well as a nonhuman deﬁ nition of Life as zoe or a dynamic and generative force It is about the embodiment of the mind and the embrainment of the body Marks 1998 Deleuze also refers to this vital energy as the great animal the cosmic machine not in any mechanistic or utilitarian way but in order to avoid any reference to biological deter minism on the one hand and overinﬂ ated psychologized indi vidualism on the other Deleuze and Guattari 1987 also use the term Chaos to refer to that roar of cosmic energy which most of us would rather ignore They are careful to point out however that Chaos is not chaotic but it rather contains the inﬁ nite expanse of all virtual forces These potentialities are real in so far as they call for actualization through pragmatic and sustainable practices To mark this close connection between the virtual and the real they turn to literature and borrow from James Joyce the neologism chaosmos This is PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species a condensation of chaos and cosmos that expresses the source of eternal energy Again the issue of language and representation comes up in this seemingly abstruse choice of terms What I ﬁ nd praise worthy on the part of my critical theory teachers is the extent to which they are willing to take the risk of ridicule by experi menting with language that shocks established habits and deliberately provokes imaginative and emotional reactions The point of critical theory is to upset common opinion doxa not to conﬁ rm it Although this approach has met with hostile reception in academia as we shall see in chapter 4 I see it as a gesture of generous and deliberate risktaking and hence as a statement in favour of academic freedom I consequently experiment with my own alternative ﬁ gura tions ranging from the nomadic subject to other conceptual personae that help me navigate across the stormy waters of the postanthropocentric predicament Rigorously material ist my own nomadic thought defends a postindividualistic notion of the subject which is marked by a monistic rela tional structure Yet it is not undifferentiated in terms of the social coordinates of class gender sexuality ethnicity and race Nomadic subjectivity is the social branch of complexity theory Where does this leave our becomingearth Actually we are in the middle of it Let us resume the argument from the idea of the posthuman subject You may remember that the recomposition of a negatively indexed new idea of the human as an endangered species alongside other nonhuman categories is currently celebrated by postanthropocentric neohumanists of all sorts from animal rights activists to ecofeminists They take the environmental crisis as evidence of the need to reinstate universal humanist values I have no real quarrels with the moral aspiration that drives this process and share the same ethical longing I am however seriously worried about the limitations of an uncritical reassertion of Humanism as the binding factor of this reactively assumed notion of a panhuman bond I want to stress that the aware ness of a new negatively indexed reconstruction of some thing we call humanity must not be allowed to ﬂ atten out or dismiss all the power differentials that are still enacted and operationalized through the axes of sexualizationracializa PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species tionnaturalization just as they are being reshufﬂ ed by the spinning machine of advanced biogenetic capitalism Criti cal theory needs to think simultaneously the blurring of cat egorical differences and their reassertion as new forms of biopolitical biomediated political economy with familiar patterns of exclusion and domination For instance in his analysis of the double limitations of both classical Humanism and Marxist oriented and postcolonial theory Dipesh Chakrabarty raises a very pertinent question if you consider the difference in carbon print between richer and poorer nations is it really fair to speak of the climate change crisis as a common human concern I would push this further and ask is it not risky to accept the construction of a negative formation of humanity as a category that stretches to all human beings all other differences notwithstanding Those differences do exist and continue to matter so what are we to make of them The process of becomingearth points to a qualitatively different planetary relation The question of differences leads us back to power and to the politics of locations and the necessity of an ethicalpolit ical theory of subjectivity namely who exactly is the we of this panhumanity bonded in fear of a common threat Chakrabarty puts it lucidly Species may indeed be the name of a paceholder for an emergent new universal history of humans that ﬂ ashes up the moment of the danger that is climate change 2009 222 As a result I would argue that critical theorists need to strike a rigorous and coherent note of resistance against the neutralization of difference that is induced by the perverse materiality and the tendentious mobility of advanced capitalism A more egalitarian road in a zoecentred way requires a modicum of goodwill on the part of the dominant party in this case anthropos himself towards his nonhuman others I am aware of course that this is asking a lot The post anthropocentric shift away from the hierarchical relations that had privileged Man requires a form of estrangement and a radical repositioning on the part of the subject The best method to accomplish this is through the strategy of de familiarization or critical distance from the dominant vision of the subject Disidentiﬁ cation involves the loss of familiar habits of thought and representation in order to pave the way PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species for creative alternatives Deleuze would call it an active deterritorialization Race and postcolonial theories have also made important contributions to the methodology and the political strategy of defamiliarization Gilroy 2005 I have defended this method as a disidentiﬁ cation from famil iar and hence normative values such as the dominant institu tions and representations of femininity and masculinity so as to move sexual difference towards the process of becoming minoritarian Braidotti 1994 2011a In a similar vein Spi nozist feminist thinkers like Moira Gatens and Genevieve Lloyd 1999 argue that socially embedded and historically grounded changes require a qualitative shift of our collective imaginings or a shared desire for transformations The con ceptual frame of reference I have adopted for the method of defamiliarization is monism It implies the openended inter relational multisexed and transspecies ﬂ ows of becoming through interaction with multiple others A posthuman subject thus constituted exceeds the boundaries of both anthropocentrism and of compensatory humanism to acquire a planetary dimension The Posthuman as Becomingmachine The issue of technology is central to the postanthropocentric predicament and it has already come out several times in the previous sections The relationship between the human and the technological other has shifted in the contemporary context to reach unprecedented degrees of intimacy and intrusion The posthuman predicament is such as to force a displacement of the lines of demarcation between structural differences or ontological categories for instance between the organic and the inorganic the born and the manufac tured ﬂ esh and metal electronic circuits and organic nervous systems As in the case of humananimal relations the move is beyond metaphorization The metaphorical or analogue func tion that machinery fulﬁ lled in modernity as an anthropo centric device that imitated embodied human capacities is replaced today by a more complex political economy that connects bodies to machines more intimately through simu PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species lation and mutual modiﬁ cation As Andreas Huyssen 1986 has argued in the electronic era wires and circuitry exercise another kind of seduction than the pistons and grinding engines of industrial machinery Electronic machines are from this angle quite immaterial plastic boxes and metal wires that convey information They do not represent any thing but rather carry clear instructions and can reproduce clear information patterns The main thrust of microelec tronic seduction is actually neural in that it foregrounds the fusion of human consciousness with the general electronic network Contemporary information and communication technologies exteriorize and duplicate electronically the human nervous system This has prompted a shift in our ﬁ eld of perception the visual modes of representation have been replaced by sensorialneuronal modes of simulation As Patri cia Clough puts it we have become biomediated bodies 2008 3 We can therefore safely start from the assumption that the cyborgs are the dominant social and cultural formations that are active throughout the social fabric with many economic and political implications The Vitruvian Man has gone cybernetic see ﬁ gure 24 Let me qualify this statement by adding that all technologies can be said to have a strong bio political effect upon the embodied subject they intersect with Thus cyborgs include not only the glamorous bodies of high tech jetﬁ ghter pilots athletes or ﬁ lm stars but also the anonymous masses of the underpaid digital proletariat who fuel the technologydriven global economy without ever accessing it themselves Braidotti 2006 I shall return to this cruel political economy in the next chapter What I want to argue next is that technological mediation is central to a new vision of posthuman subjectivity and that it provides the grounding for new ethical claims A posthu man notion of the enﬂ eshed and extended relational self keeps the technohype in check by a sustainable ethics of transformations This sober position pleads for resistance to both the fatal attraction of nostalgia and the fantasy of trans humanist and other technoutopias It also juxtaposes the rhetoric of the desire to be wired to a more radical sense of the materialism of proud to be ﬂ esh Sobchack 2004 The emphasis on immanence allows us to respect the bond of mutual dependence between bodies and technological PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species others while avoiding the contempt for the ﬂ esh and the transhumanist fantasy of escape from the ﬁ nite materiality of the enﬂ eshed self As we shall see in the next chapter the issue of death and mortality will be raised by necessity I want to argue for a vitalist view of the technologically biomediated other This machinic vitality is not so much about determinism inbuilt purpose or ﬁ nality but rather about becoming and transformation This introduces a process that Deleuze and Guattari call becomingmachine inspired by the Surrealists bachelor machines meaning a playful and pleasureprone relationship to technology that is not based on functionalism For Deleuze this is linked to the project of releasing human embodiment from its indexation Figure 24 Victor Habbick Maninblack Robot in the style of Leonardos Vitruvian Man Source Clivia  Pixmac PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species on socialized productivity to become bodies without organs that is to say without organized efﬁ ciency This is no hippy like insurrection of the senses but rather a carefully thought through programme that pursues two aims Firstly it attempts to rethink our bodies as part of a natureculture continuum in their indepth structures Secondly it adds a political dimension by setting the framework of recomposition of bodily materiality in directions diametrically opposed to the spurious efﬁ ciency and ruthless opportunism of advanced capitalism Contemporary machines are no metaphors but they are engines or devices that both capture and process forces and energies facilitating interrelations multiple con nections and assemblages They stand for radical relationality and delight as well as productivity The becomingmachine understood in this speciﬁ c sense indicates and actualizes the relational powers of a subject that is no longer cast in a dualistic frame but bears a privileged bond with multiple others and merges with ones technologi cally mediated planetary environment The merger of the human with the technological results in a new transversal compound a new kind of ecosophical unity not unlike the symbiotic relationship between the animal and its planetary habitat This is not the holistic fusion that Hegel accused Spinoza of but rather radical transversal relations that gener ate new modes of subjectivity held in check by an ethology of forces They sustain a vitalist ethics of mutual transspecies interdependence It is a generalized ecology also known as ecosophy which aims at crossing transversally the multiple layers of the subject from interiority to exteriority and every thing in between This process is what I mean by postanthropocentric posthumanism which I defend throughout this book It involves a radical estrangement from notions like moral ratio nality unitary identity transcendent consciousness or innate and universal moral values The focus is entirely on the nor matively neutral relational structures of both subject forma tion and of possible ethical relations The elaboration of new normative frameworks for the posthuman subject is the focus of collectively enacted nonproﬁ toriented experimentations with intensity that is to say with what we are actually capable of becoming They are a praxis a grounded shared project PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species not a doxa common sense belief My own concept of nomadic subject embodies this approach which combines nonunitary subjectivity with ethical accountability by fore grounding the ontological role played by relationality According to Felix Guattari the posthuman predicament calls for a new virtual social ecology which includes social political ethical and aesthetic dimensions and transversal links between them To clarify this vision Guattari proposes three fundamental ecologies that of the environment of the social nexus and of the psyche More importantly he empha sizes the need to create transversal lines through all three of them This clariﬁ cation is important and I would connect it to the theoretical reminder I issued earlier namely that we need to practise defamiliarization as a crucial method in posthuman critical theory and learn to think differently It is crucial for instance to see the interconnections among the greenhouse effect the status of women racism and xeno phobia and frantic consumerism We must not stop at any fragmented portions of these realities but rather trace trans versal interconnections among them The subject is ontologi cally polyvocal It rests on a plane of consistency including both the real that is already actualized territorialized exis tential territories and the real that is still virtual deterrito rialized incorporeal universes Guattari 1995 26 Guattari calls for a collective reappropriation of the production of subjectivity through chaosmic desegregation of the differ ent categories You may remember that Chaosmos is the universe of reference for becoming in the sense of the unfold ing of virtualities or transformative values A qualitative step forward is necessary if we want subjectivity to escape the regime of commodiﬁ cation that is the trait of our historical era and experiment with virtual possibilities We need to become the sorts of subjects who actively desire to reinvent subjectivity as a set of mutant values and to draw our plea sure from that not from the perpetuation of familiar regimes The work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela 1972 is a great source of inspiration in redesigning this type of environmentally bound postanthropocentric and non Kantian ethics of codetermination between self and other The notion of codependence replaces that of recognition much as the ethics of sustainability replaces the moral phi PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species losophy of rights This reiterates the importance of grounded situated and very speciﬁ c and hence accountable perspectives in a move that I call zoecentred egalitarianism In his analysis of the collective existential mutations 1995 2 currently taking place Felix Guattari refers to Varelas distinction between autopoietic selforganizing and allopoietic systems Guattari moves beyond the distinction proposed by Varela by extending the principle of autopoiesis which for Varela is reserved for the biological organisms to cover also the machines or technological others Another name for subjectivity according to Guattari is autopoietic subjectivation or selfstyling and it accounts both for living organisms humans as selforganizing systems and also for inorganic matter the machines Guattaris machinic autopoiesis establishes a qualitative link between organic matter and technological or machinic artefacts This results in a radical redeﬁ nition of machines as both intelligent and generative They have their own tempo rality and develop through generations they contain their own virtuality and futurity Consequently they entertain their own forms of alterity not only towards humans but also among themselves and aim to create metastability which is the precondition of individuation The emphasis on selforga nization and metastability frames the project of becoming machine of the posthuman subject It helps us rethink transversal technologically mediated subjectivity while avoid ing scientiﬁ c reductionism In his critique of the rhetoric of biotechnological vitalism 1997 Ansell Pearson warns us against the pernicious fantasy of a renaturalized notion of evolution mediated by advanced biotechnological capital ism I think that the point of the posthuman predicament is to rethink evolution in a nondeterministic but also a post anthropocentric manner In opposition to classical linear teleological ideas of evolution Chardin de Teillard 1959 I want to emphasize instead the collective project of seeking a more adequate understanding of the complexity of factors that structure the posthuman subject the new proximity to animals the planetary dimension and the high level of tech nological mediation Machinic autopoiesis means that the technological is a site of postanthropocentric becoming or the threshold to many possible worlds PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species The key notion is the transversality of relations for a postanthropocentric and posthuman subject that traces trans versal connections among material and symbolic concrete and discursive lines of relation or forces Transversality actu alizes zoecentred egalitarianism as an ethics and also as a method to account for forms of alternative posthuman sub jectivity An ethics based on the primacy of the relation of interdependence values zoe in itself I also refer to these practices of becomingmachine as radical neomaterialism Braidotti 1991 or as matter realism Fraser et al 2006 These ideas are supported by and intersect with changing understandings of the conceptual structure of matter itself De Landa 2002 Bennett 2010 under the impact of contemporary biogenetics and informa tion technologies The Spinozist switch to a monistic political ontology stresses processes vital politics and nondetermin istic evolutionary theories Politically the emphasis falls accordingly on the micropolitics of relations as a posthu manist ethics that traces transversal connections among mate rial and symbolic concrete and discursive lines or forces The focus is on the force and autonomy of affect and the logistics of its actualization Massumi 2002 Transversality actual izes an ethics based on the primacy of the relation of inter dependence which values nonhuman or apersonal Life This is what I call posthuman politics Braidotti 2006 Difference as the Principle of NotOne Let me take stock of how far we have come in the complex debate opened by the demise of anthropos Firstly I have argued that contemporary capitalism is biopolitical in that it aims at controlling all that lives It has already turned into a form of biopiracy Shiva 1997 because it exploits the generative powers of women animals plants genes and cells Secondly this means that human and anthropomorphic others are relocated in a continuum with nonanthropomor phic animal or earth others The categorical distinction that separated the Human from his naturalized others has shifted taking the humanist assumptions about what constitutes the basic unit of reference for the human into a spin Thirdly PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species this anthropocentric process produces a negative category of the human as an endangered species bound by fear of extinc tion It also forces a new unity among the human and other species in the form of compensatory extension of humanist values and rights to the nonhuman others Fourthly the same system perpetuates familiar patterns of exclusion exploitation and oppression In order to ground my claim about the advantages of a posthuman subject position based on relationality and transversal interconnections across the classical axes of differentiation the next step of the argument needs to address the question of difference I will look criti cally at the status and function of difference in this new post anthropocentric landscape As I argued in the previous chapter the most striking feature of the current scientiﬁ c redeﬁ nition of matter is the dislocation of difference from binaries to rhizomatics from sexgender or natureculture to processes of sexualization racializationnaturalization that take Life itself or the vitality of matter as the main target This system engenders a deliber ate blurring of dichotomous differences which does not in itself resolve or improve the power differences and in many ways increases them In other words the opportunistic post anthropocentric effects of the global economy engender a negative cosmopolitanism or a sense of reactive panhuman bonding by introducing the notion of Life as surplus and of a common human vulnerability The political line of questioning has to start from this ﬁ rm location to raise some key questions about subjectivity For instance Katherine Hayles argues What do gendered bodies have to do with the erasure of embodiment and the subse quent merging of machine and human intelligence in the ﬁ gure of the cyborg Hayles 1999 xii In a similar vein Balsamo who believes that bodies are always and already marked by gender and race asks 1996 6 When the human body is fractured into organs ﬂ uids and genetic codes what happens to gender identity When the body is fractured into functional parts and molecular codes where is gender located Let us trust women gays lesbians and other alter native forces with their historically leaky bodies Grosz 1994 and not fully human rights to both reassert the powers and enhance the potentiality of the posthuman organism as generative wetware PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species the contemporary classiﬁ cation of embodied subjects As I argued previously bodies are reduced to their informational substrate in terms of materiality and vital capacity By impli cation this means that the markers for the organization and distribution of differences are now located in micro instances of vital materiality like the cells of living organisms and the genetic codes of entire species We have come a long way from the gross system that used to mark difference on the basis of visually veriﬁ able anatomical differences between the empirical sexes the races and the species We have moved from the biopower that Foucault exempliﬁ ed by comparative anatomy to a society based on the governance of molecular zoe power of today We have equally shifted from disciplinary to control societies from the political economy of the Pan opticon to the informatics of domination Haraway 1990 1992 2003 The question of difference and power disparity however remains as central as ever This posthuman political landscape is not necessarily more egalitarian or less racist and heterosexist in its commitment to uphold for instance conservative gender roles and family values albeit  in the case of the Hollywood blockbusters like Avatar 2009  of the intergalactic and alien kind The power of contemporary technoculture to destabilize the categorical axes of difference exacerbates power relations and brings them to new necropolitical heights as we shall see in the next chapter It also results in some misleading tendencies like technotranscendence that coupled with a consumeroriented brand of liberal individualism emerge as one of the traits of the social imaginary of global capitalism What are the consequences of the fact that technological apparatus is no longer sexualized racialized or naturalized but rather neutralized as ﬁ gures of mixity hybridity and interconnectiveness turning transsexuality into a dominant posthuman topos If the machine is both selforganizing and transgender the old organic human body needs to be relo cated elsewhere Ever mindful of Lyotards warning about the political economy of advanced capitalism I think we should not trust the blurring effects and states of indeterminacy it engenders However tempting it would be misguided to assume that posthuman embodied subjects are beyond sexual PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species or racialized difference The politics of representation and hence the location of sexualized racialized and naturalized differences are still strongly in place though they have shifted signiﬁ cantly Bukatman 1993 In the electronic frontier as we saw earlier the technologically mediated point of refer ence is neither organicinorganic malefemale nor especially white Advanced capitalism is a postgender system capable of accommodating a high degree of androgyny and a signiﬁ  cant blurring of the categorical divide between the sexes It is also a postracial system that no longer classiﬁ es people and their cultures on grounds of pigmentation Gilroy 2000 but remains nonetheless profoundly racist A strong theory of posthuman subjectivity can help us to reappropriate these processes both theoretically and politically not only as ana lytical tools but also as alternative grounds for formations of the self Sexualized racialized and naturalized differences from being categorical boundary markers under Humanism have become unhinged and act as the forces leading to the elabora tion of alternative modes of transversal subjectivity which extend not only beyond gender and race but also beyond the human In my view posthuman ecophilosophy functions as an attempt to rethink in a materialist manner the intricate web of interrelations that mark the contemporary subjects relationship to their multiple ecologies the natural the social and the psychic as Guattari indicates More importantly for the sake of the current argument they do not abolish but profoundly restructure the processes of sexualization racial ization and naturalization which provided the pillars of bio political governmentality In terms of feminist politics this means we need to rethink sexuality without genders starting from a vitalist return to the polymorphous and according to Freud perverse in the sense of playful and nonreproductive structure of human sexuality We also need to reassess the generative powers of female embodiment In this vision gender is just a historically contingent mechanism of capture of the multiple potentiali ties of the body including their generative or reproductive capacities To turn it into the transhistorical matrix of power as suggested by queer theory in the linguistic and social con structivist tradition Butler 1991 is quite simply a concep PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species tual error From the perspective of a posthuman monist political economy power is a not a static given but a complex strategic ﬂ ow of effects which call for a pragmatic politics of intervention and the quest for sustainable alternatives Braid otti 2006 In other words we need to experiment with resistance and intensity in order to ﬁ nd out what posthuman bodies can do Because the gender system captures the com plexity of human sexuality in a binary machine that privileges heterosexual family formations and literally steals all other possible bodies from us we no longer know what sexed bodies can do We therefore need to rediscover the notion of the sexual complexity that marks sexuality in its human and posthuman forms A postanthropocentric approach makes it clear that bodily matter in the human as in other species is always already sexed and hence sexually differentiated along the axes of multiplicity and heterogeneity I have argued that matterrealist or posthuman vitalist feminism resting on a dynamic monistic political ontology shifts the focus away from the sexgender distinction bring ing sexuality as process into full focus This means by exten sion that sexuality is a force or constitutive element that is capable of deterritorializing gender identity and institutions Braidotti 1994 Combined with the idea of the body as an incorporeal complex assemblage of virtualities this approach posits the ontological priority of difference and its selftrans forming force Claire Colebrook 2000 for instance argues that sexual difference is not a problem that needs a solution but a productive location to start from Patricia MacCormack 2008 similarly draws attention to the need to return to sexuality as a polymorphous and complex visceral force and to disengage it from both identity issues and all dualistic oppositions Posthuman feminists look for subversion not in counteridentity formations but rather in pure dislocations of identities via the perversion of standardized patterns of sexualized racialized and naturalized interaction These experiments with what sexed bodies can do however do not amount to saying that in the social sphere differences no longer matter or that the traditional power relations have actually improved On the contrary on a world scale extreme forms of polarized sexual difference are stronger than ever They get projected onto geopolitical relations creating bel PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species ligerent gendered visions of a clash of civilizations that is allegedly predicated in terms of womens and GLBT peoples rights as I argued in the previous chapter These reactionary manifestations of gender dichotomies are only part of the picture The broader picture indicates that the dislocation of the former system of marking differences makes it all the more urgent to reassert the concept of difference as both central and nonessentialistic I have stressed difference as the prin ciple of notOne that is to say as differing Braidotti 2002 as constitutive of the posthuman subject and elaborate post anthropocentric forms of ethical accountability to match it In my view posthuman ethics urges us to endure the principle of notOne at the indepth structures of our subjectivity by acknowledging the ties that bind us to the multiple others in a vital web of complex interrelations This ethical principle breaks up the fantasy of unity totality and oneness but also the master narratives of primordial loss incommensurable lack and irreparable separation What I want to emphasize instead in a more afﬁ rmative vein is the priority of the rela tion and the awareness that one is the effect of irrepressible ﬂ ows of encounters interactions affectivity and desire which one is not in charge of This humbling experience of notOneness which is consti tutive of the nonunitary subject anchors the subject in an ethical bond to alterity to the multiple and external others that are constitutive of that entity which out of laziness and habit we call the self Posthuman nomadic vital political theory stresses the productive aspects of the condition of not One that is to say a generative notion of complexity At the beginning there is always already a relation to an affective interactive entity endowed with intelligent ﬂ esh and an embodied mind ontological relationality A materialist poli tics of posthuman differences works by potential becomings that call for actualization They are enacted through collec tively shared communitybased praxis and are crucial to support the process of vitalist nonunitarian and yet account able recomposition of a missing people This is the we that is evoked and actualized by the postanthropocentric creation of a new panhumanity It expresses the afﬁ rmative ethical dimension of becomingposthuman as a gesture of collective PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species selfstyling It actualizes a community that is not bound negatively by shared vulnerability the guilt of ancestral communal violence or the melancholia of unpayable onto logical debts but rather by the compassionate acknowledge ment of their interdependence with multiple others most of which in the age of anthropocene are quite simply not anthropomorphic Conclusion In this chapter I have pursued a dual aim I provided an answer to the question of what the posthuman might be in a postanthropocentric perspective and argued the case for a posthuman theory that takes into account subjectivity The most serious political problems in postanthropocen tric theory arise from the instrumental alliance of biogenetic capitalism with individualism as a residual humanist deﬁ ni tion of the subject My view of posthuman thought is instead profoundly antiindividualistic and it consists in working within the belly of the beast resisting the myth of organicism and holistic harmony but also capitalist opportunism Kath erine Hayles 1999 286 makes a powerful intervention on contemporary posthuman bodies But the posthuman does not really mean the end of humanity It signals instead the end of a certain conception of the human    What is lethal is not the posthuman as such but the grafting of the posthuman onto a liberal humanist view of the self    Located within the dialectic of patternrandomness and grounded in embodied actuality rather than disembodied information the posthuman offers resources for rethinking the articulation of humans with intelligent machines Hayles attacks the classical humanistic notion that subjectiv ity must coincide with conscious agency in such a way as to avoid some of the mistakes of the humanist past notably the liberal vision of an autonomous subject whose manifest destiny is to dominate and control nature Hayles 1999 288 One of the risks of the hype that surrounds the post anthropocentric bodymachines is indeed that of recreating a PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species hard core unitary vision of the subject under the cover of pluralistic fragmentation We run the risk of reasserting tran scendence via technological meditation and of proposing a neouniversal machinic ethos In the language of posthuman critical theory this would produce the deception of a quan titative multiplicity which does not entail any qualitative shifts To avoid this pitfall which ﬁ ts in with the neoliberal euphoria and in order to enact qualitative transformations instead we need to be equally distanced from both hypedup disembodiment and fantasies of transhumanist escape and from reessentialized centralized notions of liberal individu alism I propose to reinscribe posthuman bodies into radical relationality including webs of power relations at the social psychic ecological and microbiological or cellular levels The postanthropocentrism of our science and our globalized and technologically mediated times makes it urgent to work towards a new technoscientiﬁ c democracy Haraway 1997 95 The status and the location of Humanism which was the theme of the previous chapter are central to this discussion of postanthropocentrism I tend to resist the political neu trality of critical social and science theorists who support an analytic form of postanthropocentrism and avoid or dismiss the question of subjectivity I maintain that the post anthropocentric subject rests also on the antihumanist project which means that I want to keep an equal distance from both the humanistic assumptions of the universal value of the unitary subject and the extreme forms of science driven posthumanism which dismiss the need for a subject altogether One needs at least some subject position this need not be either unitary or exclusively anthropocentric but it must be the site for political and ethical accountability for collective imaginaries and shared aspirations Philosophical investiga tions of alternative ways of accounting for the embedded and embodied nature of the subject are relevant to develop an approach to subjectivity worthy of the complexities of our age As I will argue more extensively in chapter 4 this discus sion reopens the question of the relationship between the two cultures the Humanities and Science My point is that the social studies of science Latour 1993 are not the only or PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species even the most useful tools of analysis for the complex phe nomena surrounding the postanthropocentric technobodies of advanced capitalism Let me get to this from another angle I have argued that zoeegalitarianism expresses the simultaneously materialist and vitalist force of life itself zoe as the generative power that ﬂ ows across all species The new transversal alliance across species and among posthuman subjects opens up unex pected possibilities for the recomposition of communities for the very idea of humanity and for ethical forms of belonging These are not conﬁ ned to negative bonding in terms of sharing the same planetary threats climate change environmental crisis or even extinction What I propose is a more afﬁ rmative approach to the redeﬁ nition of posthuman subjectivity as in the counter models of transversal relational nomadic assem blages we saw earlier in this chapter or the extended nature cultural self as an alternative to classical Humanist subjectivity in the previous chapter Many more models are thinkable and feasible if we collectively choose to experiment systemati cally with the project of what we the differently located posthuman subjects of the anthropocene era might be capable of becoming We all stand to gain by the acknowledgment of a post anthropocentric transversal structural link in the position of these embodied nonhuman subjects that were previously known as the others of the anthropocentric and humanistic Man The ethical part of the project concerns the creation of a new social nexus and new forms of social connection with these technoothers What kinds of bonds can be estab lished within the natureculture continuum of technologically mediated organisms and how can they be sustained Both kinship and ethical accountability need to be redeﬁ ned in such a way as to rethink links of affectivity and responsibility not only for nonanthropomorphic organic others but also for those technologically mediated newly patented creatures we are sharing our planet with In opposition to the nostalgic trend that is so dominant in contemporary politics but also opposing a tendency to mel ancholia on the part of the progressive Left Derrida 2001b Butler 2004a Gilroy 2005 I want to argue that the posthu man emphasis on lifezoe itself can engender afﬁ rmative poli PostAnthropocentrism Life beyond the Species tics Critical postanthropocentrism generates new perspectives that go beyond panic and mourning and produce a more workable platform For one thing it produces a more ade quate cartography of our reallife conditions because it focuses with greater accuracy on the complexities of contem porary technologically mediated bodies and on social prac tices of human embodiment Furthermore this type of vital materialism unconstrained by clearcut distinctions between species composes the notion of zoe as a nonhuman yet gen erative lifeforce This posthuman approach moves beyond high cyber studies Haraway 1985 Hayles 1999 into post cyber materialism Braidotti 2002 and posthuman theory Braidotti 2006 A nomadic zoecentred approach connects human to nonhuman life so as to develop a comprehensive ecophilosophy of becoming This posthuman and postanthropocentric sensibility which draws on deep affective as well as intellectual resources also expresses my rejection of the principle of adequation to the doxa or commonly received normative image of thought The posthuman predicament in both the posthumanist and the postanthropocentric sense of the term drives home the idea that the activity of thinking needs to be experimental and even transgressive in combining critique with creativity As Deleuze and Guattari teach us thinking is about the inven tion of new concepts and new productive ethical relations In this respect theory is a form of organized estrangement from dominant values More clinical than critical posthuman theory cuts to the core of classical visions of subjectivity and works towards an expanded vision of vitalist transversal relational subjects Theory today is about coming to terms with unprecedented changes and transformations of the basic unit of reference for what counts as human This afﬁ rmative unprogrammed mutation can help actualize new concepts affects and planetary subject formations Just as we do not know what posthuman bodies can do we cannot even begin to guess what postanthropocentric embodied brains will actu ally be able to think up Chapter 3 The Inhuman Life beyond Death One of my favourite ﬁ lms is Marcel LHerbiers LInhumaine 1924 With sets designed by Fernand Léger and Robert MalletStevens it is a manifesto of expressionist elegance constructivist exuberance and futurist selfconﬁ dence What is inhuman in this masterful artwork is symptomatic of its own historical moment The ﬁ lm deals with the superhuman capacity of the female of our species to manipulate and control the course of human history and evolution A highly seductive alliance is struck between the female body and the accelerating powers of technology The ambivalence of fear and desire towards technology is recast in the mode of an ancestral patriarchal suspicion towards powerful women and women in positions of power The progressive promise as well as the destructive potential of the female bodymachine is held in close and calculated balance The technological artefact and the mechanic other are both gendered and eroticized in modernism and become the emblem of a technologydriven future Huyssen 1986 In yet another expressionist masterpiece Fritz Langs Metropo lis 1927 the heroine Maria is the demonical robot that perverts the course of history It is based on the futurist novel LEve future Future Eve Villiers de lIsleAdam 1977 which depicts the mechanical bodyother of the industrial revolution as an object of intense desire ﬂ esh turns to metal The Inhuman Life beyond Death to fuel capital growth Progress is visualized as a fantasy landscape where locomotives successfully drive the train of Western history through endless tunnels Both machinevamp and praying mantis both virginmother and pregnant suicide bomber LHerbiers character Claire in LInhumaine and Langs Maria express the highly sexualized and deeply gen dered relationship of the twentieth century to its industrial technology and machinery This vision however is not only caught in an anthropomorphic frame which locates the human at the centre of world evolution it also upholds the distinction between the human and the technological if only to redeﬁ ne it as a new alliance This produces a multifaceted inhuman world The modernist era stressed the power of technology not as an isolated event but as a crucial element in the assemblage of industrialization which involved manufactured objects money power social progress imagination and the construc tion of subjectivity As a critical analysis of this historical moment Marxism and its socialist Humanism taught us that objectiﬁ cation is indeed a humiliating and demeaning experi ence for humans in that it denies their full humanity and can thus be truly called inhuman at a basic social level The com modiﬁ cation process itself reduces humans to the status of manufactured and hence proﬁ tdriven technologically medi ated objects This insight constitutes the core of the humanist heart of Marxism which I analysed in chapter 1 Subsuming human relations into the nexus moneypower is for Marx ists a form of inhumanity and the key social injustice of capi talist modes of production This normative stance is all the more striking as Marxism was from the methodological angle an antihumanist theoretical movement that argued against natural essences and debunked the naturalization of differences as a power strategy As we saw in chapter 1 Marxist social constructivism was a deeply antiessentialist methodology resting on a Hegelian philosophy of history which ﬁ rmly believed in technologically driven social prog ress Even Lenin deﬁ ned socialism the motor of historical progress as the soviets local workers councils plus electricity The modernist delirium and its Marxist offshoot did not entirely go up in smoke though many of those railroad tracks The Inhuman Life beyond Death did lead to disaster To return to Marcel LHerbiers ﬁ lm the analogy between the cruelty of the seductress on the one hand and the ruthless energy of the mechanical engine on the other produced a notion of the inhuman as superhuman that posed technology as a transcendent other It also instilled cruelty as a salient element of the narrative of growth and progress already aware that these new technologies cannot but alter the organic human body through new forms of wanted and unwanted intimacy There is consequently another aspect of the inhuman as it is invoked by the modernist canon namely the function and structure of the imagination as expressed in art Modernism located the issue of artistic practice at the core of industrial ized modernity Both the technological object and the artefact are manufactured and hence pertain to the realm of the un natural Their antinaturalistic structure is precisely the common denominator between the machine and the perverse as in nonprocreative sexuality of the femme fatale of art works like LInhumaine and Metropolis Female sexuality is inscribed in this inhuman script as a threat but also as an irresistible attraction technoEves of multiple temptations pointing the way to unsettling futures The inhuman nature of the artistic object consists of a combination of nonfunctionalism and ludic seductiveness This is precisely what the surrealists meant by the bachelor machines  an idea that Deleuze and Guattari adopted and transformed in the theory of bodies without organs or afunctional and unorganic frames of becoming Art not unlike critical philosophy is for Deleuze an intensive practice that aims at creating new ways of thinking perceiving and sensing Lifes inﬁ nite possibilities Deleuze and Guattari 1994 By transposing us beyond the conﬁ nes of bound iden tities art becomes necessarily inhuman in the sense of non human in that it connects to the animal the vegetable earthy and planetary forces that surround us Art is also moreover cosmic in its resonance and hence posthuman by structure as it carries us to the limits of what our embodied selves can do or endure In so far as art stretches the boundaries of representation to the utmost it reaches the limits of life itself and thus confronts the horizon of death To this effect art is linked to death as the experience of limits Blanchot 2000 The Inhuman Life beyond Death I will return to this point later on in the chapter in my discus sion of a posthuman philosophy of death To pursue the point about the inhumanity of technoindus trial culture it should be added at this stage of the argument that scientiﬁ c reason and the rational practices of scientiﬁ c research are not at all alien to both the project of modernism and its inhuman aspects Science shares the mixed legacy of this historical period and is central to the project of indus trialized modernity Mechanical others from impressive industrial machinery to banal household appliances are the coveted objects of collectively funded and socially empow ered scientiﬁ c practices They are yet another expression of that mixture of fear and desire for technology that art and cinema make manifest The inhuman aspects including cruelty and violence are a crucial component of the scientiﬁ c ratio in the modernist era As Paul Rabinow put it 2003 103 The twentieth century witnessed the establishment of a potent and malign connection between knowledge and the military    From the horriﬁ c effects of poison gas and other gifts of the chemical industries through the atom bomb and other gifts of physics and engineering through the Nazi nightmare of racial puriﬁ cation and other gifts of anthropology and the biosciences to the indigestible fact that close to three quar ters of the spending on scientiﬁ c research during the Cold War was devoted to military ends The industries and science of Thanatos have had a glorious century The issue of death and of killing is raised here this time in relation to the aims and structure of science itself Jean Francois Lyotards work The Inhuman 1989 contributes a crucial chapter to this discussion Pursuing the critical stance announced in his classical text The Postmodern Condition 1984 he deﬁ nes the inhuman as the alienating and com modifying effect of advanced capitalism on the human The technological intrusion and manipulation is such as to de humanize this subject in the name of ruthless efﬁ ciency Lyotard does not stop at this technophobic insight but goes on to identify a deeper kind of inhumanity which is speciﬁ c to anthropos himherself That inner core of structural strangeness or productive estrangement is for Lyotard the The Inhuman Life beyond Death nonrational and nonvolitional core of the inhuman which makes us quintessentially human1 It not only conﬁ rms the nonunitary structure of the subject but also functions as the site of ultimate resistance by humanity itself against the de humanizing effects of technologydriven capitalism In this respect for Lyotard the inhuman has a productive ethical and political force which points the way to posthuman ethical relations In this chapter I defend the position that the current his torical context has transformed the modernist inhuman into a posthuman and postanthropocentric set of practices The inhuman is not what it used to be The relationship between the human and the technological other as well as the affects involved in it including desire cruelty and pain change radically with the contemporary technologies of advanced capitalism For one thing the technological con struct now mingles with the ﬂ esh in unprecedented degrees of intrusiveness as we saw in the previous chapter Moreover the nature of the humantechnological interaction has shifted towards a blurring of the boundaries between the genders the races and the species following a trend that Lyotard assesses as a distinctive feature of the contemporary inhuman condition The technological other today  a mere assemblage of circuitry and feedback loops  functions in the realm of an egalitarian blurring of differences if not downright inde terminacy The most eloquent cinematic expression of the neoandrogynous character of advanced capitalism is a ﬁ lm like Avatar 2009 which is as removed from LInhumaine as an iPhone is from an icon There is no doubt as to which is more fashionable today but this is not the point The point is the extraordinary evolution of technology and its unex pected sideeffects From the modernist fantasy of eroticizing the human machine interaction to the postmodernist disenchantment or at least ironical distance from the technological object something fundamental shifted A different political economy of affects came into action a colder sensibility entered our system paving the road to the posthuman Zygmunt Bauman 1 This entity is akin to the Freudian uncanny the Lacanian real and Kristevas abjection 1982 The Inhuman Life beyond Death 1993 1998 was among the ﬁ rst to comment on this cruel colder approach In response to the historical disasters and the pain incurred in the historical era which Eric Hobsbawm called the short twentieth century 1994 and more speciﬁ  cally the Holocaust Bauman stressed the toll that such awful events took upon the moral ﬁ bre and the ethical sensibility of the perpetrators as well as the victims of the violence This results in the brutalization of our moral selves or an increase of moral bestiality among humans Anticolonial and antiracist thinkers like Aimé Césaire and Frantz Fanon also developed this insight into the dissociation of moral sensibil ity that takes place in the soul of the misogynists the racists and the fascists In comparison to this lowering of the ethical standards the victims of violence actually tread the moral high ground This insight lies at the core of the postcolonial nonWestern neohumanism which I analysed in chapter 1 The question now becomes how does the moral crisis of modernity play out in the posthuman frame of reference Does the posthuman condition innovate also on the plane of the inhumane aspects of our planetary interaction Does it introduce dehumanization on a global scale If one considers the scale of the major issues confronting the contemporary world from the ﬁ nancial crises and their consequences for employment and structural economic inequalities to climate change and the ensuing environmental crises not to mention geopolitical conﬂ icts terrorism and humanitarian armed interventions it is clear that the posthuman condition has engendered its own inhumane dimension This chapter deals with the multilayered issue of the inhuman by examining multiple modes of relation to death and dying In an argument about life that constitutes the perfect counterpart of the idea of zoe as a posthuman con tinuum I propose to look more closely at Thanatos and to necropolitics as a way of constructing an afﬁ rmative posthu man theory of death I think that a conceptual shift towards matterrealist vitalism grounded in ontological monism can assist us in this project of rethinking death and mortality in the contemporary biomediated context Politically we need to assess the advantages of the politics of vital afﬁ rmation Ethically we need to relocate compassion and care of both human and nonhuman others in this new frame The Inhuman Life beyond Death We saw in the previous chapter that the posthuman predica ment understood as the biopolitical management of living matter is postanthropocentric in character raising the need for a Lifezoecentred approach Now I want to go a step further and argue that posthuman vital politics shifts the boundaries between life and death and consequently deals not only with the government of the living but also with practices of dying Most of these are linked to inhumane social and political phenomena such as poverty famine and homeless ness which Zillah Eisenstein aptly labelled as global obsceni ties 1998 Vandana Shiva 1997 stresses the extent to which biopower has already turned into a form of bio piracy which calls for very grounded and concrete political analyses Thus the bodies of the empirical subjects who signify difference womannativeearth or natural others have become the disposable bodies of the global economy Contemporary capitalism is indeed biopolitical in that it aims at controlling all that lives as Foucault argues but because Life is not the prerogative of humans only it opens up a zoepolitical or postanthropocentric dimension If anxiety about extinction was common in the nuclear era the posthuman condition of the anthropocene extends the death horizon to most species Yet there is a very important differ ence as Chakrabarty points out A nuclear war would have been a conscious decision on the part of the powers that be Climate change is an unintended consequence of human actions as a species 2009 221 This not only inaugurates a negative or reactive form of panhuman planetary bond which recomposes humanity around a commonly shared bond of vulnerability but also connects the human to the fate of other species as I argued in the previous chapter Death and destruction are the common denominators for this trans versal alliance Let me give you some examples of contemporary ways of dying to illustrate this political economy The posthuman aspects of globalization encompass many phenomena that while not being a priori inhumane still trigger signiﬁ cant destructive aspects The postsecular condition with the rise The Inhuman Life beyond Death of religious extremism in a variety of forms including Chris tian fundamentalism entails a political regression of the rights of women homosexuals and all sexual minorities Sig niﬁ cant signs of this regression are the decline in reproductive rights and the rise of violence against women and GLBT people The effect of global ﬁ nancial networks and un checked hedge funds has been an increase in poverty espe cially among youth and women affected by the disparity in access to the new technologies The status of children is a chapter apart from forced labour to the childsoldier phe nomenon childhood has been violently inserted in infernal cycles of exploitation Bodily politics has shifted with the simultaneous emergence of cyborgs on the one hand and renewed forms of vulnerability on the other Thus next to the proliferation of pandemics like SARS Ebola HIV bird ﬂ u and others more familiar epidemics have also returned notably malaria and tuberculosis so much so that health has become a public policy issue as well as a human rights concern The point is that Lifezoe can be a threatening force as well as a generative one A great deal of health and environ mental concerns as well as geopolitical issues simply blur the distinction between life and death In the era of bio genetic capitalism and natureculture continuum zoe has become an infrahuman force and all the attention is now drawn to the emergency of disappearing nature For instance the public discourse about environmental catastrophes or natural disasters  the Fukushima nuclear plant and the Japanese tsunami the Australian bushﬁ res hurricane Katrina in New Orleans etc  accomplishes a signiﬁ cant double bind it expresses a new ecological awareness while reinsert ing the distinction between nature and culture As Protevi argues 2009 this results in the paradoxical renaturaliza tion of our biotechnologically mediated environment The geopolitical forces are simultaneously renaturalized and subjected to the old hierarchical power relations determined by the dominant politics of the anthropomorphic subject Public discourse has become simultaneously moralistic about the inhuman forces of the environment and quite hypocritical in perpetuating anthropocentric arrogance This position results in the denial of the manmade structure of the catas The Inhuman Life beyond Death collective control like the earth the cosmos or nature Our public morality is simply not up to the challenge of the scale and the complexity of damages engendered by our techno logical advances This gives rise to a double ethical urgency ﬁ rstly how to turn anxiety and the tendency to mourn the loss of the natural order into effective social and political action and secondly how to ground such an action in the responsibility for future generation in the spirit of social sustainability that I have also explored elsewhere Braidotti 2006 Another signiﬁ cant case in point is the posthuman digital universe that I analysed in the previous chapter and which engenders its own inhuman variables They are best mani fested by the proliferation of viruses both computerbased and organic some of which transit from animals to humans and back Illness is clearly not only a prerogative of organic entities but includes a widespread practice of mutual con tamination between organic matter  anthropomorphic or not  and electronic circuitry A rather complex symbiotic relationship has emerged in our cyber universe a sort of mutual dependence between the ﬂ esh and the machine This engenders some signiﬁ cant paradoxes namely that the cor poreal site of subjectivity is simultaneously denied in prac tices of human enhancement and in fantasies of escape via technotranscendence and it is also reenforced as increased vulnerability Balsamo 1996 argues that digital technology promotes dreams of immortality and control over life and death And yet such beliefs about the technological future life of the body are complemented by a palpable fear of death and annihilation from uncontrollable and spectacular bodythreats antibioticresistant viruses random contamina tion ﬂ esheating bacteria Balsamo 1996 12 The inhuman forces of technology have moved into the body intensifying the spectral reminders of the corpsetocome Our social imaginary has taken a forensic turn Popular culture and the infotainment industry are quick to pick up this contradictory trend that reﬂ ects the changing status of the demise of the human body including illness death and extinction The corpse is not only a daily presence in global media and journalistic news but also an object of The Inhuman Life beyond Death entertainment in contemporary popular culture notably in the successful genre of forensic detectives Culture and the arts have been very sensitive in registering the rise in women who kill as shown by the success of recent literary and stage renditions of classics like Hecuba and Medea Not to mention of course the global appeal of sharpshooting Lara Croft in the world of computer games The evolution of gender roles towards a more egalitarian participation by both sexes in the business of killing is one of the most problematic aspects of contemporary gender poli tics They can be summarized as the shift from the universal Human Rights stance of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo to the brutal interventionism of the Chechnya war widows pregnant female suicidebombers and the growing role of women in the military Humanism of humanitarian wars Spiritual death is part of the picture as well if we take into account contemporary embodied social practices that are often pathologized and never addressed fully such as addictions eating disorders and melancholia burnout and states of apathy and disaffection I propose not to simply classify these practices as selfdestructive but rather to see them as normatively neutral manifestations of interaction with and resistance to the political economy of commodiﬁ ca tion of all that lives They exemplify the shifting social rela tions between living and dying in the era of the politics of life itself The currency granted to both legal Ritalin Prozac and illegal drugs in contemporary culture blurs the boundaries between selfdestruction and fashionable behav iour and forces a reconsideration of what is the value of life itself Last but not least assisted suicide and euthanasia practices are challenging the Law to rest on the tacit assump tion of a selfevident value attributed to Life As is often the case advanced capitalism functions by schizoid or inter nally contradictory moves Thus a socially enforced ideology of ﬁ tness health and eternal youth goes hand in hand with increased social disparities in the provision of health care and in mortality rates among infants and youth The obsession with being forever young works in tandem with and forms the counterpart of social practices of euthanasia and assisted death The moment one starts thinking about it multiple ways of dying of inﬂ icting death and suffering losses are proliferating The Inhuman Life beyond Death around us And yet when it comes to accounting for them social theory tends to refer to this political economy as bio political What does life bios have to do with it though Biopolitical analyses since Foucault have transformed the ﬁ eld and introduced more precise understandings of what is involved in the management of the living Why is not the same degree of analytical precision devoted to the analysis of the necropolitical management of dying Both the quantity and the scale of the changes that have taken place in social and personal practices of dying in ways of killing and forms of extinction as well as the creativity of mourning rituals and the necessity of bereavement are such as to support the expansion of the sociocultural agenda This includes the emergence of a new discursive domain Death Studies has become a new and much needed addition to the academic landscape growing out of the 1970s countercul ture into a serious interdisciplinary area that includes moral and religious discussions about mortality but also research in social policy and health issues as well as the very practical aspect of professional training2 I shall return to this expan sion of new studies areas in chapter 4 Beyond Biopolitics Let us start again from the basic insight that the new practices of biopolitical management of life mobilize not only gen erative forces but also new and subtler degrees of death and extinction My argument is that a focus on the vital and self organizing powers of Lifezoe undoes any clearcut distinc tions between living and dying It composes the notion of zoe as a posthuman yet afﬁ rmative lifeforce This vitalist mate rialism rests solidly on a neoSpinozist political ontology of monism and radical immanence engendering a transversal relational ethics to counteract the inhumane aspects of the posthuman predicament 2 See for instance the Centre for Death and Society at the Uni versity of Bath in the UK Several journals also testify to the vitality of this ﬁ eld See among others Death Studies Routledge 1970 redesigned in 1985 Journal of Death and Dying Baywood Pub lishing 1970 and Journal of NearDeath Studies 1978 The Inhuman Life beyond Death I have argued so far that the posthuman predicament in so far as it dislocates the traditional understandings of the human also entails signiﬁ cant changes in the status and struc ture of the inhuman and of inhumane practices The next question then is how do these new formations of the inhuman impact on a theory of the subject and on social and cultural theory Biopolitical analysis is central to this discussion but in the current context it has moved beyond the premises articulated by Foucault in his pioneering efforts I perceive several new trends in thinking about the biopolitical man agement of life and death For instance a school of bio political citizenship has emerged with emphasis on the ethical implications of bio power as an instance of governmentality that is as empowering as it is conﬁ ning Rabinow 2003 Rose 2007 Esposito 2008 This school of thought locates the political moment in the relational and selfregulating accountability of a bioethical subject that takes full respon sibility for hisher genetic existence including illness and other forms of responsibility for ones embodied self As we saw in the previous chapter this position allows for a residual type of Kantianism to emerge around the last phase of Fou caults work with emphasis on individual responsibility for the selfmanagement of ones health and lifestyle The advan tage of this position is that it calls for a higher degree of lucidity about posthuman bioorganic existence which means that the naturalist paradigm is deﬁ nitely abandoned The disadvantage of this position however is that it perverts the notion of responsibility towards individualism in a political context of neoliberal dismantling of the national health service a pillar of the welfare state and increasing privatiza tion Bioethical citizenship indexes access to and responsibil ity for the cost of basic social services like health care to an individuals manifest ability to act responsibly by reducing the risks and exertions linked to the wrong lifestyle In other words here bioethical agency means taking adequate care of ones own genetic capital The recent government cam paigns against smoking excessive drinking and obesity con stitute evidence of this neoliberal normative trend that supports hyperindividualism The neoKantian take on Foucault raises also serious theo retical questions about the notion of biopower Considering The Inhuman Life beyond Death the fast rate of progress and change undergone by contem porary biotechnologies and the challenges they throw to the status of the human Foucaults work has been criticized notably by Haraway 1997 for relying on an outdated vision of contemporary technology Haraway suggests that Fou caults biopower provides the cartography of a world that no longer exists and that we have now entered the age of the informatics of domination Other critical theories come closer to the target notably feminist environmentalist and race theorists who have addressed the shifting status of embodi ment and difference in advanced capitalism in a manner that reﬂ ects the complexity of global social relations3 The central discrepancy between Foucaults notion of bio power and contemporary posthuman structures has to do with the displacement of anthropocentrism In chapter 2 I argued that the biogenetic structure of advanced capitalism reduces bodies to carriers of vital information which get invested with ﬁ nancial value and capitalized They provide the material for new classiﬁ cations of entire populations on the basis of the genetic predispositions and vital capacities for selforganization There is a structural isomorphism between economic and biological growth which makes the power relations of contemporary neoliberal capitalism rawer and cruder than in the Fordist era Cooper 2008 This has important repercussions for the zoe dimension of the politics of dying Because genetic information like psychological traits or neural features is unevenly distributed this system is not only inherently discriminatory but also racist at some basic level of the term Patricia Clough 2008 explores this aspect of the contemporary political economy by analysing the public debates on the availability of pharmaceutical drugs against HIV or largescale vaccines against malaria to mention just a few contemporary examples of posthuman management of Life A whole underclass of genetically overexposed and socially underinsured disposable bodies is engendered both within the Western world and in the emerging global econo mies This kind of population control goes beyond Foucaults 3 See especially Gilroy 2000 Braidotti 2002 Barad 2003 Butler 2004b and Grosz 2004 The Inhuman Life beyond Death analysis of the biopolitical as it does not function by tech niques of discipline and control but rather by biogenetic farming of data and by biopiracy Shiva 1997 As Mark Halsey put it Where once the sole objective was to control the insane the young the feminine the vagrant and the deviant the objective in recent times has been to arrest the nonhuman the inorganic the inert  in short the socalled natural worlds  Halsey 2006 15 This is posthuman zoepolitics not biopolitical governmentality Again monistic posthuman philosophy is of great assis tance to think through these challenging new historical condi tions Reading Deleuze through the lens of Massumi Clough studies the new mechanisms of capture not of liberal indi viduals but biogenetic dividuals statistically reconﬁ gured in populations that surface as pro ﬁ les of bodily capacities indicating what a body can do now and what capacities it might be able to unfold in the future The affective capacity of bodies statistically simulated as risk factors can be apprehended as such without the subject even without the individual subjects body This results in bringing forth competing bureaucratic procedures of control and polit ical command in terms of securing the life of the population 2008 18 This way of linking forms of political control with the estima tion of risk factors is a technique that Foucault deﬁ ned as racism as it conﬁ gures  it engenders as raced  entire populations in a hierarchical scale this time not determined by pigmentation but by other genetic characteristics Because the aim of this political exercise is to estimate a given popula tions chance of survival or of extinction the biopolitical management of the living is not only transversal across species and zoedriven but also inherently linked to death This is the deathbound or necropolitical face of postanthropocen trism and the core of its inhumane character it permits the healthy life of some populations to necessitate the death of others marked as natures degenerate or unhealthy ones Clough 2008 18 The necropolitical dimension also means that the political representation of embodied subjects nowadays can no longer be understood within the visual economy of biopolitics in The Inhuman Life beyond Death Foucaults 1978 sense of the term The representation of embodied subjects is not visual in the sense of being scopic as in the postPlatonic sense of the simulacrum Nor is it specular as in the psychoanalytic mode of redeﬁ ning vision within a dialectical scheme of oppositional recognition of self andas other The representation of embodied subjects has been replaced by simulation and has become schizoid or internally disjointed It is also spectral the body doubles up as the potential corpse it has always been and is represented as a selfreplicating system that is caught in a visual economy of endless circulation Braidotti 2002 The contemporary social imaginary is immersed in this logic of boundless circu lation and thus is suspended somewhere beyond the life and death cycle of the imaged self The biogenetic imagination has consequently become forensic in its relationship to the body as corpse and in the quest for traces of a life that it no longer controls Contemporary embodied subjects have to be accounted for in terms of their surplus value as biogenetic containers on the one hand and as visual commodities cir culating in a global media circuit of cash ﬂ ow on the other Much of this information is not knowledgedriven but rather mediainﬂ ated and thus indistinguishable from sheer enter tainment They are therefore doubly mediated by biogenetic and by informational codes We see then that contemporary biopolitics intersects with the ecophilosophical dimension I analysed in the previous chapter and illuminates the negative face of current socio political power relations The challenge consists in turning these hybrid and slightly schizoid social phenomena into points of resistance to the inhuman aspects of the posthuman condition The central insight of Foucaults political anatomy remains valid biopower also involves the management of dying In other words the question of the governance of life contains that of extinction as well In order to deploy the full ethical and political potential of this brilliant insight however we do need to return to the early Foucault and not be misled by the neoKantian interpretation of his second phase In his earlier work Foucault 1977 focuses explicitly on the critical analysis of the power mechanisms at work in the production of subjectivity The latter is deﬁ ned as a process of both discursive and material circulation of effects The Inhuman Life beyond Death which are productive and not only conﬁ ning This emphasis on power is crucial to make sense of the posthuman predicament Forensic Social Theory Social and political theory after Foucault has been invested by these transformations in the status and the theory of the human as shown for instance in one of the most signiﬁ cant responses to the forensic turn by Giorgio Agamben 1998 He deﬁ nes Lifezoe as the result of the lethal intervention of sovereign power onto the embodied subject who is reduced to bare life that is to say a nonhuman status of extreme vulnerability bordering on extinction Biopower here means Thanatospolitics and it results for Agamben in the indict ment of the project of industrialized modernity in view of its dehumanizing effects The colonial plantation is the proto type of this political economy and the enslaved human almost the epitome of homo sacer Agamben 1998 This insight results in drawing intrinsic links between modernization and violence modernity and terror sovereignty and murder The inhuman for Agamben not unlike Lyotard is the effect of modernization but he also learned from Hannah Arendt 1951 to look at the phenomenon of totalitarianism as the ultimate denial of the humanity of the other Arendt however constructed a powerful alternative to these political extremes by stressing the necessity of human rights for all even and especially the dehumanized others Arendt is in Seyla Benhabibs brilliant formulation a reluctant modern ist 1996 Agamben on the other hand is less innovative and perpetuates the philosophical habit that consists in taking mortality or ﬁ nitude as the transhistorical horizon for dis cussions of life For him bare life is not generative vitality but rather the constitutive vulnerability of the human subject which sovereign power can kill it is that which makes the body into disposable matter in the hands of the despotic force of unchecked power This is linked to Heideggers theory of being as deriving its force from the annihilation of animal life Finitude is introduced as a constitutive element within the framework of subjectivity which also fuels an affective The Inhuman Life beyond Death subject I am perturbed by this ﬁ xation on Thanatos that Nietzsche criticized over a century ago and which is still very present in critical debates today It often produces a gloomy and pes simistic vision not only of power but also of the technological developments that propel the regimes of biopower My understanding of life as zoe ethics of sustainable transforma tions differs considerably from what Agamben calls bare life or negative zoe I beg to differ from the habit that favours the deployment of the problem of zoe on the horizon of death or of liminal state of nonlife This overemphasis on the horizons of mortality and perishability is characteristic of the forensic turn in contemporary social and cultural theory haunted by the spectre of extinction and by the limitations of the project of western modernity I ﬁ nd the overemphasis on death as the basic term of reference inadequate to the vital politics of our era I therefore turn to another signiﬁ cant community of scholars who work within a Spinozist frame work4 and prefer to emphasize the politics of life itself as a relentlessly generative force including and going beyond death This requires an interrogation of the shifting inter relations between human and nonhuman forces Speaking from the position of an embodied and embedded female subject capable of reproducing the future and the species I ﬁ nd the metaphysics of ﬁ nitude to be a myopic way of putting the question of the limits of what we call life We need to rethink death the ultimate subtraction as another phase in a generative process as I will argue in the second half of this chapter Too bad that the relentless generative powers of death require the suppression of that which is the nearest and dearest to me namely myself my own vital beingthere For the narcissistic human subject as psycho analysis teaches us it is unthinkable that Life should go on without my being there Laplanche 1976 The process of confronting the thinkability of a Life that may not have me or any human at the centre is actually a

respects vulner ability while actively constructing social horizons of hope On Contemporary Necropolitics At this point in the book it is important to stress that afﬁ rma tive politics as the process of transmuting negative passions into productive and sustainable praxis does not deny the reality of horrors violence and destruction It just proposes a different way of dealing with them Contemporary politics has more than its fair share of cruelty to account for New scholarship has concentrated on the brutality of todays wars and the renewed expressions of violence which target not only the government of the living but also multiple practices of dying Biopower and necropolitics are two sides of the same coin as Achille Mbembe 2003 brilliantly argues The explosion of discursive interest in the politics of life itself in other words affects also the geopolitical dimension of death and of killing Mbembe expands Foucaults insight in the direction of a more grounded analysis of the biopolitical management of survival Aptly renaming it necropolitics he deﬁ nes this power essentially as the administration of death the generalized instrumentalization of human exis tence and the material destruction of human bodies and population Mbembe 2003 19 And not only human I might add but also planetary The postCold War world has seen not only a dramatic increase in warfare but also a profound transformation of the practice of war as such New forms of warfare entail simultaneously the breathtaking efﬁ ciency of intelligent unmanned technological weaponry on the one hand and the rawness of dismembered and humiliated human bodies on the other This is exempliﬁ ed by Gaddaﬁ s undigniﬁ ed end which I evoked in the third vignette of the introduction Posthuman wars breed new forms of inhumanity The impli cations of this approach to necropower are radical it is not up to the rationality of the Law and the universalism of moral values to structure the exercise of power but rather the The Inhuman Life beyond Death unleashing of the unrestricted sovereign right to kill maim rape and destroy the life of others This political economy structures the attribution of different degrees of humanity according to hierarchies that are disengaged from the old dialectics and unhinged from biopolitical logic They fulﬁ l instead a more instrumental narrow logic of opportunistic exploitation of the life in you which is generic and not only individual Contemporary necropolitics has taken the politics of death on a global regional scale The new forms of industrial scale warfare rest upon the commercial privatization of the army and the global reach of conﬂ icts which deterritorialize the use of and the rationale for armed service Reduced to infrastructural warfare Mbembe 2003 and to a large scale logistical operation Virilio 2002 war aims at the destruction of all the services that allow civil society to func tion roads electricity lines airports hospitals and other necessities The oldfashioned army has now mutated into urban militias private armies armies of regional lords private security ﬁ rms and state armies all claim the right to exercise violence or to kill Mbembe 2003 32 As a result as a political category the population has also become dis aggregated into rebels child soldiers victims or refugees or civilians incapacitated by mutilation or massacred on the model of ancient sacriﬁ ces while the survivors after a horriﬁ c exodus are conﬁ ned to camps and zones of excep tion Mbembe 2003 34 Many contemporary wars led by Western coalitions under the cover of humanitarian aid are often neocolonial exercises aimed at protecting mineral extraction and other essential geophysical resources needed by the global economy In this respect the new wars look more like privatized conﬂ icts and guerrilla or terrorist attacks than the traditional confrontation of enlisted and nationally indexed armies Arjun Appadurai 1998 has also provided incisive analy ses of the new ethnocidal violence of the new forms of warfare which involve friends kinsmen and neighbours He is appalled by the violence of these conﬂ icts associated with brutality and indignity  involving mutilation cannibalism rape sexual abuse and violence against civilian spaces and populations Put brieﬂ y the focus here is on bodily brutality The Inhuman Life beyond Death perpetrated by ordinary persons against other persons with whom they may have  or could have  previously lived in relative amity Appadurai 1998 907 This is the speciﬁ cally inhuman edge of the posthuman condition Chomsky commented shrewdly on this new situation which he labelled the new military humanism of the human itarian interventions Armed with the technology of global devastation and the jargon of pulp ﬁ ction tabloid headlines and PlayStation games the War on terror the Clash of Civilisations the Axis of Evil Operation Shock and Awe Those adventures set out to save the civilized world homo humanus from its enemies homo barbarus under the venerable banners of liberty decency and democracy Quoted in Davies 1997 134 This deployment of technologically mediated violence cannot be adequately described in terms of disciplining the body ﬁ ghting the enemy or even as the techniques of a society of control We have rather entered the era of orchestrated and instrumental massacres a new semiosis of killing leading to the creation of multiple and parallel deathworlds Mbembe 2003 37 These necropolitical modes of gover nance also circulate as infotainment in global media circuits according to the logic of double mediation I mentioned before The special issue of the weekly magazine The Economist 2 June 2012 p 13 on Morals and the Machine which I mentioned in chapter 1 offers an impressive update on con temporary military technology It argues that recent develop ments are producing an extraordinary new technobestiary For instance the Sand Flea built by Boston Dynamics a spinoff from MIT can leap through a window or onto a roof nine metres high while gyrostabilizers allow smooth ﬁ lming all the way The 5 kg robot then rolls along on wheels until it needs to jump again Then comes RISE a sixlegged robocockroach that can climb walls a TerraMax robotic kit made by Oshkosh Defense Wisconsin that turns military lorries or armoured vehicles into remotely controlled machines LS3 is a doglike robot that uses computer vision so that it trots behind a human over rough terrain carrying The Inhuman Life beyond Death up to 180 kg of supplies SUGV a briefcasesized robot running on caterpillar tracks can identify a man in a crowd upload a mugshot and follow him First Look a military robot Made by iRobot another MIT spinoff is designed to be thrown through windows or over walls Scout XT Throw bot made by Recon Robotics in Minnesota shaped like a twoheaded hammer with wheels on each head has the heft of a grenade and can be thrown through glass windows Wheel spikes provide traction on steep or rocky surfaces An aquatic version is in the making This is indeed the stuff of science ﬁ ction come true As The Economist points out by far the most effective new weapons however are the UGVs unmanned ground vehi cles which started work in Afghanistan a decade ago and the UAVs unmanned aerial vehicles  also known as drones or remotely piloted aircraft RPA  which are part of a large robot army that includes land and sea as well as air In 2005 CIA drones struck targets in Pakistan three times last year there were 76 strikes one of them crucial to killing Gaddaﬁ in Libya Drones come in all sorts of sizes DelFly a drag onﬂ yshaped surveillance drone built at the technical univer sity in Delft weighs less than a gold wedding ring camera included At the other end of the scale comes Americas biggest and fastest drone Avenger at a cost of US15 mn which can carry up to 27 tonnes of bombs sensors and other equipment at more than 740 kmh Do drones make killing too easy Not necessarily answers The Economist They process so much data that they ﬁ ght warfare by committee Government lawyers and others in operating rooms monitor video feeds from robots to call off strikes that are illegal or would look bad on CNN These remote human observers moreover are working in more humane surroundings and are unaffected by combat stress The FireShadow a robotic missile

Guardian Carroll 2012 RPA or drone pilots argue that their jobs involve different types of courage from conventional warfare not only because they have to take the consequences of possible mistakes but also because a different degree of rigour and accuracy is needed to kill by remote control These telethanatological warriors need sophisticated equipment such as multispec tral targeting systems that integrate infrared sensors enhanced TV camera and laser designators and illuminators into single packages Carroll 2012 2 Moreover this complex multi tasking structure of this kind of warfare often takes place under close scrutiny from an array of specialists and supervi sors ofﬁ cers intelligence analysts and military lawyers included Drones do not kill more easily in any sense of the term Critics of these lethal technologies who include former US President Jimmy Carter think otherwise They argue that the drone strikes are extrajudicial executions that violate nations sovereignty stain US moral standing and fuel extremism Carroll 2012 2 They maintain that the best way of dealing with these complex questions is to ban autonomous battle ﬁ eld weapons altogether and require robots to have the full attention of humans all the time In Berlin in 2012 a group of engineers philosophers and activists formed the Interna tional Committee for Robot Arm Control ICRAC in order to try to control the effects of the autonomy reached by con temporary robotic weapon systems and especially drones As the Obama administration pledges investments to the tune of US15 bn for Predator and Reaper drones however there is no denying their growing importance as both offensive weapons and as policy instruments The Economist points out other advantages of posthuman warfare and argues that autonomous robotsoldiers could do more good than harm they would not rape women burn down civilian dwellings in anger or become erratic decision makers under the emotional stress of combat By analogy The Inhuman Life beyond Death driverless cars are likely to be safer than ordinary vehicles just as autopilots have made planes safer Furthermore drones are increasingly being used for civilian purposes not unlike other robots that have long been employed in nuclear plants on the ﬂ ightdeck of passenger aircraft and in driver less trains A recent report by the newspaper The Guardian Franklin 2012 describes how a batteryoperated drone with a range of 300 km and a cost of less than US800 is used by environmental activists to spot and possibly stop Japanese whaling operations in the waters of Antarctica What was once exclusive to Israeli spy forces and the US Air Force is now sent on missions ranging from the survey of marine mammals to crop inspections The Federal Aviation Author ity in the USA has just issued new directives for the use of these vehicles The readers can only marvel at the sophistication of these technological achievements but also wonder about the inhuman risks involved in postanthropocentric weaponry It is also striking to note the role played by academic research in leading universities in the development of these killing robots The timehonoured bond between academia and the military has entered a new highly productive phase in our posthuman world Postanthropocentric technologies are also reshaping the practice of surveillance in the social ﬁ eld Border control of immigration and the smuggling of people are major aspects of the contemporary inhuman condition and central players in the necropolitical game Diken 2004 argues that refugees and asylum seekers become another emblem of the contem porary necropower because they are the perfect instantiation of the disposable humanity that Agamben also calls homo sacer and thus constitute the ultimate necropolitical subject The proliferation of detention and highsecurity camps and prisons within the once civicminded space of European cities is an example of the inhuman face of Fortress Europe The camps  sterilized monofunctional enclosures Diken 2004 91  stand as the undigniﬁ ed monuments of posthuman inhumanity Dufﬁ eld 2008 pushes the necropolitical sociopolitical analysis further and makes a distinction between developed or insured humans and underdeveloped or uninsured The Inhuman Life beyond Death humans Developed life is sustained primarily through regimes of social insurance and bureaucratic protection his torically associated with industrial capitalism and the growth of welfare states Dufﬁ eld 2008 149 The distinction and the tensions between these two categories constitute the terrain for the global civil war which is Dufﬁ elds deﬁ nition of globalized advanced capitalism The link to colonialism is clear decolonization created nationstates whose people once enslaved are now free to circulate globally These people constitute the bulk of the unwanted immigrants refugees and asylum seekers who are contained and locked up across the developed world In a twist not deprived of ironical force world migration is perceived as a particular threat in Europe precisely because it endangers Europes main social infra structure the welfare state The growing range of warfare weapons and killing techniques raises critical questions about the status of death as an object of contemporary political analysis The scale and sophistication of technological mediation in contemporary necropolitics indicates that death as a concept remains caught in a contradiction It is central to political theory and practice in terms of the new killing techniques within a fastexpanding technological context which increases human vulnerability Death is also however underexamined as a term in critical theory and as established practice in sociopolitical governance and international relations Death as a concept remains unitary and undifferentiated while the repertoire of political thought around Life and biopower proliferates and diversiﬁ es Fortunately new posthuman theory is ﬁ lling this vacuum and making important contributions Patrick Hanaﬁ n 2010 for instance suggests that renewed interest in necropolitics coupled with a transversal vision of posthuman subjectivity may help us provide a political and ethical counternarrative to the imposed bounded subject of liberal legalism 2010 133 For Hanaﬁ n this involves a move from the traditional location of mortality as the deﬁ ning quasimetaphysical horizon of being The majoritarian masculine legal social contract is built on the desire to survive This is not a politics of empowerment but one of entrapment in an imagined natural order that in our system translates into a biopolitical The Inhuman Life beyond Death regime of discipline and control of bodies What this means is that we are recognized as full citizens only through the position of victims loss and injury and the forms of repara tion that come with it Posthuman necropolitical political and legal theory raises the question of what political theory might look like if it were not based on the negative instances of wound and loss Hanaﬁ n proposes to take the necropolitical dimension seriously by shifting away from thinking of legal subjectivity as deathbound to thinking about singularities without iden tity who relate intimately to one another and the environment in which they are located This points towards a posthuman critical politics of rights We see here how another fundamen tal binary of Western philosophical thinking gets uncoupled that of a political life qualiﬁ ed by death as opposed to a political and legal philosophy which valorizes our mortal condition and creates a politics of survival This is a post identitarian position that encourages us following Virginia Woolf to adopt a mode of thinking as if already gone that is to say to think with and not against death The emphasis on the deathlife continuum may according to Hanaﬁ n con stitute the ultimate threat to a legal system built on the con ﬁ ning horizon of the metaphysics of mortality William Connollys politics of becoming 1999 argues a similar case against necropolitical destruction we need to develop an ethos of engagement with existing social and political givens  including the horrors of our times  in order to bring about countereffects that is to say unexpected con sequences and transformations Critical theory needs to engage with the present becoming worthy of the times while resisting the violence horror and injustices of the times Braidotti 2008 Afﬁ rmative ethics is based on the praxis of constructing positivity thus propelling new social conditions and relations into being out of injury and pain It actively constructs energy by transforming the negative charge of these experiences even in intimate relationships where the dialectics of domination is at work Benjamin 1988 For Deleuze and Guattari the timeline for this political activity is that of Aion the continuous tense of becoming which is different from working within or against the Chronos of the hegemonic political order We need to actively and collec The Inhuman Life beyond Death tively work towards a refusal of horror and violence  the inhuman aspects of our present  and to turn it into the con struction of afﬁ rmative alternatives Such necropolitical thought aims to bring afﬁ rmation to bear on undoing existing arrangements so as to actualize productive alternatives In the rest of this chapter I will attempt to think the lifedeath continuum within this ongoing engagement with the political accountability of posthuman subjectivity Posthuman Theory on Death One of the obvious preliminary conclusions we can draw from all the above is that we need to think more rigorously about ways of dying in the posthuman context of necro politics on the one hand and the new forensic social sensibil ity on the other How would a vitalist and materialist understanding of death work Death is not a human preroga tive especially in the era of disappearing nature Having reached the antipodes of the rationalist idea of human stew ardship of nature the environmental question is how to prevent species extinction This is a biopolitical issue which species are allowed to survive and which to die And what are the criteria that would allow us to decide Posthuman theory stresses the point that in order to develop adequate criteria we need an alternative vision of subjectivity to support this effort and make it operational We should start by itemizing the different socially distrib uted and organized ways of dying violence diseases poverty accidents wars and catastrophes The persistence of political violence and notions of just wars is part of this conversation as is the analysis of the ways in which critical philosophers have dealt with death Critchley 2008 Then we may proceed by looking at internally produced and selfrun ways of dying suicide burnout depression and other psychosomatic pathologies What does posthuman death theory look like It provides a fuller understanding of how biopolitics actually works in the contemporary context marked by the new wars and by remotecontrolled technothanatological weaponry A necropolitical approach produces a more accurate cartogra phy of how contemporary embodied subjects are interacting The Inhuman Life beyond Death and interkilling In turn this approach offers new analytical tools for an ethics that respects both the horror and the com plexity of our times and attempts to deal with them afﬁ rma tively Quite an agenda which I regret that I cannot do full justice to here Ones view on death depends on ones assumptions about Life In my vitalist materialist view Life is cosmic energy simultaneously empty chaos and absolute speed or move ment It is impersonal and inhuman in the monstrous animal sense of radical alterity zoe in all its powers This does not mean that zoe or life as absolute vitality is not above nega tivity because it can hurt Zoe is always too much for the speciﬁ c slab of enﬂ eshed existence that constitutes single sub jects The human is a step down for pure intensity or the force of the virtual It is a constant challenge for us to rise to the occasion to be worthy of our times while resisting them and thus to practise amor fati afﬁ rmatively It is quite demanding to catch the wave of lifes intensities in a secular manner and ride on it exposing the boundaries or limits as we transgress them No wonder that most of us as George Eliot astutely observed turn our back on that roar of cosmic energy We often crack in the process of facing life and just cannot take it anymore Death is the ultimate transposition though it is not ﬁ nal as zoe carries on relentlessly Death is the inhuman conceptual excess the unrepresent able the unthinkable and the unproductive black hole that we all fear Yet death is also a creative synthesis of ﬂ ows energies and perpetual becoming Gilles Deleuze 1983 1990b 1995 suggests that to make sense of death we need an unconventional approach that rests on a preliminary and fundamental distinction between personal and impersonal death The former is linked to the suppression of the indi vidualized ego The latter is beyond the ego a death that is always ahead of me and marks the extreme threshold of my powers to become In other words in a posthuman perspec tive the emphasis on the impersonality of life is echoed by an analogous reﬂ ection on death Because humans are mortal death or the transience of life is written at our core it is the event that structures our timelines and frames our time zones not as a limit but as a porous threshold In so far as it is everpresent in our psychic and somatic landscapes as The Inhuman Life beyond Death the event that has always already happened Blanchot 2000 death as a constitutive event is behind us it has already taken place as a virtual potential that constructs everything we are The full blast of the awareness of the transitory nature of all that lives is the deﬁ ning moment in our existence It structures our becomingsubjects our capacity and powers of relation and the process of acquiring ethical awareness Being mortal we all are have beens the spectacle of our death is written obliquely into the script of our temporality not as a barrier but as a condition of possibility This means that what we all fear the most our being dead the source of anguish terror and fear does not lie ahead but is already behind us it has been This death that pertains to a past that is forever present is not individual but impersonal it is the precondition of our existence of the future This proximity to death is a close and intimate friendship that calls for endurance in the double sense of temporal duration or continuity and spatial suffering or sustainability Making friends with the impersonal necessity of death is an ethical way of installing oneself in life as a transient slightly wounded visitor We build our house on the crack so to speak We live to recover from the shocking awareness that this game is over even before it started The proximity to death suspends life not into transcendence but rather into the radical immanence of just a life here and now for as long as we can and as much as we can take This does not mean however that Life unfolds on the horizon of death As I argued before this classical notion is central to the metaphysics of ﬁ nitude that especially in the Heideggerian tradition sacralizes death as the deﬁ ning feature of human consciousness I want to stress instead the produc tive differential nature of zoe which means the productive aspect of the lifedeath continuum It does not deny the reality of horrors but rather to rework it so as to assert the vital powers of healing and compassion This is the core of posthuman afﬁ rmative ethics in a contemporary Spinozist mode Braidotti 2011b An illuminating example is pro vided by Edouard Glissant 1997 whose work on colonial ism and literature reframes the horrors of modernity in an afﬁ rmative manner starting from the worldhistorical experience of slavery Glissant applies nomadic thought to The Inhuman Life beyond Death the critique of dominant nationbound mostly Eurocentric mothertongues Calling for hybridized polylingualism and creolization on a global scale is an afﬁ rmative answer to the coercive monoculturalism imposed by the colonial and impe rial powers The ethics of productive afﬁ rmation is a different way of handling the issue of how to deal with pain and traumas and to operate in situations which are extreme while working to bring out the generative force of zoe  life beyond the egobound human In this perspective death is not the teleological destination of life a sort of ontological magnet that propels us forward I repeat that death is behind us Death is the event that has always already taken place at the level of consciousness As an individual occurrence it will come in the form of the physi cal extinction of the body but as event in the sense of the awareness of ﬁ nitude of the interrupted ﬂ ow of my being there death has already taken place We are all synchronized with death  death is the same thing as the time of our living in so far as we all live on borrowed time The time of death as event is the impersonal continuous present of Aion per petual becoming not only the linear and individualized Chronos The temporality of death is time itself by which I mean the totality of time Some of these ideas may seem counterintuitive to the secular critical theorists I want to insist however on the necessity of rethinking posthuman life beyond the old boundaries of death We may do well to remember here the importance of the tactic of defamiliarization which I out lined in the previous chapter To approach death differently we may want to start by introducing some critical distance from the allegedly selfevident value attributed to Life in our culture I live in a world where some people kill in the name of a sacralized Right to life I would like to refer to a more lucid tradition of thought that does not start from the assumption of the inherent selfevident and intrinsic worth of life and stresses instead the traumatic elements of this same life in their often unnoticed familiarity Life in other words is an acquired taste an addiction like any other an openended project One has to work at it Life is passing and we do not own it we just inhabit it not unlike a time share location The Inhuman Life beyond Death Death of a Subject My vitalist notion of death is that it is the inhuman within us which frees us into life Each of us is always already a has been as we are mortal beings Desire as the ontological drive to become potentia seduces us into going on living If sustained long enough life becomes a habit If the habit becomes selffulﬁ lling life becomes addictive which is the opposite of necessary or selfevident Living just a life there fore is a project not a given because there is nothing natural or automatic about it One has to jumpstart into life regu larly by renewing the electromagnetic charge of desire though one often ends up going through the day on automatic pilot Life is at best compelling but it is not compulsive Beyond pleasure and pain life is a process of becoming of stretching the boundaries of endurance Where does this vital notion of death leave critical theory The experiment of defamiliarization consists in trying to think to inﬁ nity against the horror of the void in the wilder ness of nonhuman mental landscapes with the shadow of death dangling in front of our eyes Thought then becomes a gesture of afﬁ rmation and hope for sustainability and endur ance of immanent relations and timebound consistency Moving beyond the paralysing effects of suspicion and pain working across them is the key to ethics Posthuman critical thought does not aim at mastery but at the transformation of negative into positive passions Life is desire which essentially aims at expressing itself and consequently runs on entropic energy it reaches its aim and then dissolves like salmon swimming upstream to procreate and then die The wish to die can consequently be seen as the counterpart and as another expression of the desire to live intensely The corollary is more cheerful not only is there no dialectical tension between Eros and Thanatos but these two entities are really just one lifeforce that aims to reach its own fulﬁ lment Posthuman vital materialism displaces the bound aries between living and dying Life or zoe aims essentially at selfperpetuation and then after it has achieved its aim at dissolution It can be argued therefore that Life as zoe also encompasses what we call death As a result what we The Inhuman Life beyond Death humans most deeply aspire to is not so much to disappear but rather to do so in the space of our own life and in our own way Phillips 1999 It is as if each of us wishes to die in our own fashion Our innermost desire is for a selffash ioned a selfstyled death We thus pursue what we are ulti mately trying to avoid and become virtual existential suicides not from nihilism but because it is our nature to die and our deepest desire to selffashion our own death Of course it is a paradox it is the paradox of the inhuman as analysed by Lyotard something in the structure of the human that simply resists belonging to common humanity and stretches beyond The ontological inhuman has often been rendered as the sacred but for a secular materialist like myself this is not convincing What we do stretch out towards is endless cosmic energy which is as ﬁ erce as it is selforga nizing The awareness of the beyond has to do with death as the experience that has always already happened not as transcendental whathaveyou While at the conscious level all of us struggle for survival at some deeper level of our unconscious structures all we long for is to lie silently and let time wash over us in the stillness of nonlife Selfstyling ones death is an act of afﬁ rmation because it means cultivat ing an approach a style of life that progressively and con tinuously ﬁ xes the modalities and the stage for the ﬁ nal act leaving nothing unattended Pursuing a sort of seduction into immortality the ethical life is life as virtual suicide Life as virtual suicide is life as constant creation Life lived so as to break the cycles of inert repetitions that usher in banality Lest we delude ourselves with narcissistic pretences we need to cultivate endurance immortality within time that is to say death in life It bears repeating that the generative capacity of this life death continuum cannot be bound or conﬁ ned to the single human individual It rather transversally trespasses all bound aries in the pursuit of its aim which is selfperpetuation as the expression of its potency It connects us transindividually transgenerationally and ecophilosophically Just as the life in me is not mine or even individual in the narrow appropria tive sense espoused by liberal individualism so the death in me is not mine except in a very circumscribed sense of the term In both cases all I can hope for is to craft both my The Inhuman Life beyond Death life and my death in a mode at a speed and fashion which can sustain all the intensity I is capable of I can selfstyle this gesture autopoietically thus expressing its essence as the constitutive desire to endure I call it potentia Becomingimperceptible What we humans truly yearn for is to disappear by merging into this generative ﬂ ow of becoming the precondition for which is the loss disappearance and disruption of the atom ized individual self The ideal would be to take only memo ries and to leave behind only footsteps What we most truly desire is to surrender the self preferably in the agony of ecstasy thus choosing our own way of disappearing our way of dying to and as our self This can be described also as the moment of ascetic dissolution of the subject the moment of its merging with the web of nonhuman forces that frame himher the cosmos as a whole We may call it death but in a monistic ontology of vitalist materialism it has rather to do with radical immanence That is to say the grounded total ity of the moment when we coincide completely with our body in becoming at last what we will have been all along a virtual corpse Death the inhuman within marks the becomingimper ceptible of the subject as the furthest frontier of the processes of intensive transformation or becoming This is no transcen dence but radical empirical immanence that is to say a reversal of all that lives into the roar of the chaosmic echoing chamber of becoming It marks the generative force of zoe the great animalmachine of the universe beyond personal individual death Remember that this is a secular discourse generated by a critical theory that wants to think to the end the natureculture continuum within a monistic ontology that considers all matter as intelligent and selforganizing Recognizing this continuum makes us able to be worthy of all that happens to us amor fati being the pragmatic acknowl edgment that the posthuman subject is the expression of successive waves of becoming fuelled by zoe as the ontologi cal motor It is neither human nor divine but relentless material and vowed to multidirectional and crossspecies The Inhuman Life beyond Death relationality Life does go on relentlessly nonhuman in the vital force that animates it Becomingimperceptible marks the point of evacuation or evanescence of the bounded selves and their merger into the milieu the middle grounds the radical immanence of the earth itself and its cosmic reso nance Becomingimperceptible is the event for which there is no representation because it rests on the disappearance of the individuated self Writing as if already gone or thinking beyond the bounded self is the ultimate gesture of de familiarization This process actualizes virtual possibilities in the present in a time sequence that is somewhere between the no longer and the not yet mixing past present and future into the critical mass of an event The vital energy that propels the transmutation of values into afﬁ rmation is the potentia of life as perpetual becoming that expresses itself through the chaotic and generative void of positivity The event enacts a seduction into Life that breaks from the spec tral economy of negativity and involves making friends with impersonal death Posthuman death theory as a vital continuum could not be further removed from the notion of death as the inanimate and indifferent state of matter the entropic state to which the body is supposed to return It rather spells desire as plenitude and overﬂ owing not as lack Death is the becom ingimperceptible of the posthuman subject and as such it is part of the cycles of becoming yet another form of inter connectedness a vital relationship that links one with other multiple forces The impersonal is life and death as bioszoe in us  the ultimate outside as the frontier of the incorporeal becomingimperceptible The paradox of afﬁ rming life as potentia energy even in and through the suppression of the speciﬁ c slice of life that I inhabit is a way of pushing both posthumanism and post anthropocentrism to the point of implosion It dissolves death into evershifting processual changes and thus disintegrates the ego with its capital of narcissism paranoia and negativ ity Death as process from the speciﬁ c and highly restricted viewpoint of the ego is of no signiﬁ cance whatsoever The kind of self that is styled in and through such a process is notOne yet nor is it an anonymous multiplicity The self is differential and constituted through embedded and embodied The Inhuman Life beyond Death sets of interrelations The inner coherence of this posthuman subject is held together by the immanence of hisher expres sions acts and interactions with others and by the powers of remembrance or continuity in time I refer to this process in terms of sustainability so as to stress the idea of endurance which it entails Sustainability does assume faith in a future and also a sense of responsibility for passing on to future generations a world that is liveable and worth living in A present that endures is a sustainable model of the future Against this selfglorifying image of a pretentious and egotis tical narcissistic and paranoid consciousness posthuman critical theory unleashes the multiple dynamic forces of zoe that do not coincide with the human let alone with con sciousness These nonessentialistic brands of vitalism frame the posthuman subject My vitalist brand of materialism could not be further removed from the Christian afﬁ rmation of Life or the tran scendental delegation of the meaning and value system to categories higher than the embodied self Quite the contrary it is the intelligence of radically immanent ﬂ esh that states with every single breath that the life in you is not marked by any master signiﬁ er and it most certainly does not bear your name The awareness of the absolute difference between intensive or incorporeal affects and the speciﬁ c affected bodies that one happens to be is crucial to afﬁ rmative posthu man ethics Death is the unsustainable but it is also virtual in that it has the generative capacity to engender the actual Consequently death is but an obvious manifestation of prin ciples that are active in every aspect of life namely the imper sonal power of potentia The posthuman subject rests on the afﬁ rmation of this kind of multiplicity and the relational con nection with an outside that is cosmic and inﬁ nite Conclusion On Posthuman Ethics The posthuman predicament entails speciﬁ c forms of inhumane practices that call for new frames of analysis and new normative values In this chapter I have addressed the necropolitical aspects on the posthuman condition through several interrelated issues Firstly I discussed the destructive The Inhuman Life beyond Death aspects of the new forms of reactive or negative panhuman ity engendered by shared global risk societies and the general subsumption of all that lives to a political economy of capi talization of the informational capital of Life itself Secondly I focused on the pervasive forms of technological mediation and the extent to which global communication networks and biogenetic intervention have restructured the natureculture relation into a complex continuum that is as destructive as it can be generative Cases in point are the new wars including humanitarian interventions and automated weaponry capable of humanfree decision making I have argued for the need to recast the lifedeath distinction in terms of a vital con tinuum based on internal differentiations I presented it as the double overturning ﬁ rstly of individualism in favour of complex singularities and secondly of anthropocentrism in favour of multiplicities of nonhuman ﬂ ows and assemblages Throughout all these cases I stressed the inhumanity and the violence of our times and called for afﬁ rmative practices to counteract the necropolitical economy we are caught in Let me summarize a number of features of this posthuman necropolitical turn The ﬁ rst point is that the political and legal subject of this regime of lifedeath governmentality is a postanthropocentric ecosophical entity This zoedriven subject is marked by the interdependence with its envi ronment through a structure of mutual ﬂ ows and data transfer that is best conﬁ gured as complex and intensive interconnectedness Secondly this environmentally bound subject is a ﬁ nite collective entity moving beyond the parameters of classical Humanism and anthropocentrism The human organism is an inbetween that is plugged into and connected to a variety of possible The Inhuman Life beyond Death this hightech ecological manner entails full immersion in ﬁ elds of constant ﬂ ows and transformations Not all of them are positive of course because the inhuman aspects entail multiple forms of vulnerability although in such a dynamic system they cannot be known or judged a priori Thus we need to experiment with new practices that allow for a mul tiplicity of possible instances  actualizations and counter actualizations  of the different lines of becoming as I outlined in the previous chapter Thirdly such a subject of zoepower raises questions of ethical and political urgency Given the acceleration of pro cesses of change how can we tell the difference among the different ﬂ ows of changes and transformations Transforma tive lines of ﬂ ight or becoming need to be accounted for and mapped out as a collective assemblage of possible other paths of becoming No monolithic or static model can provide an adequate answer we need more pragmatic openendedness and a diversiﬁ cation of possible strategies The starting point is the relentless generative but also destructive force of zoe and the speciﬁ c brand of transspecies egalitarianism which they establish as the grounds for posthuman ethics It is a matter of forces as well as of ethology Fourthly the speciﬁ c temporality of the posthuman subject needs to be rethought beyond the metaphysics of mortality The subject is an evolutionary engine endowed with her or his own embodied temporality both in the sense of the spe ciﬁ c timing of the genetic code and the more genealogical time of individualized memories If the embodied subject of bio power is a complex molecular organism a biochemical factory of steady and jumping genes an evolutionary entity endowed with its own navigational tools and an inbuilt temporality then we need a form of ethical values and politi cal agency that reﬂ ects this high degree of temporal complex ity My point is that by adopting a different vision of the subject and with it a new notion of the natureculture interac tion critical theory may be able to move beyond modernist and rather reductive conceptions of the inhuman Fifthly and last this ethical approach cannot be dissoci ated from considerations of power The zoecentred vision of the technologically mediated subject of postmodernity or advanced capitalism is fraught with internal contradictions The Inhuman Life beyond Death the subject Braidotti 2002 The zoecentred egalitarianism that is potentially conveyed by the current technological transformations has dire consequences for the humanistic vision of the subject The potency of zoe in other words displaces the exploitative and necropolitical gravitational pull of advanced capitalism Both liberal individualism and classical humanism are disrupted at their very foundations by the social and symbolic transformations induced by our his torical condition Far from being merely a crisis of values this situation confronts us with a formidable set of new opportunities They converge through different paths upon a recomposition of our shared understanding of the human as a species One of these is the negative bond of panhuman vulnerability I analysed in the previous chapter the sense that we are all in this mess together all other differences not withstanding Another approach much closer to my heart is to start from those differences of location and by accounting for them in terms of power as both restrictive and productive potestas and potentia to experiment with different modes of posthuman subjectivity I have argued that as a possible response to this challenge we should consider the posthu manistic brand of postanthropocentric vitalism and have deﬁ ned posthuman theory accordingly This conviction is supported by my historical and geo political location which makes me aware of the schizoid coincidence of diametrically opposed social effects over consumption and depletion of the worlds reserves of biodi versity in seeds grains plants and water supplies seem able to coexist in a political economy of exploitation and celebra tion of Life itself Similarly the epidemic of anorexiabulimia on the one hand and povertyinduced starvation on the other express the spasmodic waves of expansion and shrinking of the bodyweight in the population of the opulent classes of the world and the thinning out and wilful destruction of many other peoples by active intervention or sheer neglect The biopolitical and the necropolitical combine to re locate embodied subjectivity in a posthuman continuum that calls for new ethical coding Thus I also recognize that the The Inhuman Life beyond Death status of embodied humans who become collateral damage in hightech wars that hit them from the sky with intelligent bombs dropped by computerdriven drones is closer to that of the animals at Sarajevo zoo which were forcefully freed as a result of NATO bombing and roamed the streets  ter rorized and terrifying the humans till they succumbed to friendly ﬁ re  than it is to the Geneva Convention deﬁ nition of casualties of war I want to confront the necropolitical governmentality of biogenetic capitalism and think from within the awareness that the market prices of exotic birds and quasiextinct animals are comparable often to the advan taged of the plumed species to that of the disposable bodies of women children and others in the global sex trade and industry Conrads terrifying dictum Exterminate the brutes knows no species boundaries today This is the inhuman face of my location the posthuman here and now in which I situate posthuman critical theory as the active quest for afﬁ r mative alternatives It is also the framework within which I want to propose a creative alternative through secular non essentialist vital materialism and an afﬁ rmative theory of posthuman death as the generative inhuman within the subject which makes us all too human Chapter 4 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory How could the Humanities fail to be affected by the posthu man condition The dislocations of the discursive boundaries and categorical differences triggered respectively by the explo sion of humanism and the implosion of anthropocentrism causes an internal fracture within the Humanities that cannot be mended just by goodwill Let us assess the damage on the basis of the analyses I provided in the three previous chapters In the ﬁ rst chapter I discussed the fallout of posthuman ism The idea of the Human implied in the Humanities that is to say the implicit assumptions about what constitutes the basic unit of reference for the knowing subject is the Vitru vian model It is the image of Man as a rational animal endowed with language Antihumanists over the last thirty years questioned both the selfrepresentation and the image of thought implied in the Humanist deﬁ nition of the Human especially the ideas of transcendental reason and the notion that the subject coincides with rational consciousness This ﬂ attering selfimage of Man is as problematic as it is partial in that it promotes a selfcentred attitude Furthermore by organizing differences on a hierarchical scale of decreasing worth this humanist subject deﬁ ned himself as much by what he excluded from as by what he included in his self representation an approach which often justiﬁ ed a violent Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory and belligerent relationship to the sexualized racialized and naturalized others that occupied the slot of devalued differ ence Furthermore claims to universalism were critiqued as being exclusive androcentric and Eurocentric They support masculinist racist or racial supremacist ideologies that turn cultural speciﬁ city into a fake universal and normality into a normative injunction This image of thought perverts the practice of the Humanities and in particular theory into an exercise of hierarchical exclusion and cultural hegemony Over the last thirty years new critical epistemologies have offered alternative deﬁ nitions of the human by inventing interdisciplinary areas which call themselves studies like gender feminism ethnicity cultural studies postcolonial media and new media and Human rights studies Bart et al 2003 Throughout this book I have foregrounded feminist theory as a major point of theoretical and methodological reference According to James Chandler 2004 this prolifera tion of counterdiscourses creates a condition of critical disci plinarity which is a symptom of the posthuman predicament Chandler argues that since Foucaults pertinent diagnosis of the death of Man the traditional organization of the university in departmental structures has been challenged by the growth of these new discursive areas This proliferation of discourses is both a threat and an opportunity in that it requires method ological innovations such as a critical genealogical approach that bypasses the mere rhetoric of the crisis The fallout of postanthropocentrism which I outlined in chapter 2 sets a different agenda for the Humanities and not only in terms of research priorities The image of thought implied in the postanthropocentric deﬁ nition of the Human goes much further in the deconstruction of the subject because it stresses radical relationality that is to say non unitary identities and multiple allegiances As this shift occurs in a globalized and conﬂ ictridden world it opens up new challenges in terms of both postsecular and postnationalist perspectives including a new European dimension marked by multilingualism and cultural diversity1 What is the place of the Humanities as a scientiﬁ c enterprise in this globalized 1 This aspect of global diversity is also known as vernacular cosmopolitanism Bhabha 1996b Nava 2002 Gunew 2004 Werbner 2006 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory network culture Terranova 2004 that no longer upholds the unity of space and time as its governing principle In the era of citizens science2 and citizens journalism what can be the role of academic research institutions The displacement of anthropocentrism and the scrambling of species hierarchy leaves the Human unmoored and un supported which deprives the ﬁ eld of the Humanities of muchneeded epistemological foundations The question of the future of the Humanities the issue of their renewal and the recurrent threat of death of the disciplines is aggravated by one central factor the new humannonhuman linkages among them complex interfaces involving machinic assem blages of biological wetware and nonbiological hard ware  Bono et al 2008 3 We saw in chapter 2 that the dualistic distinction natureculture has collapsed and is replaced by complex systems of datafeedback interaction and communication transfer This places the issue of the relationship between the two cultures at the centre of the agenda again Against the prophets of doom I want to argue that technologically mediated postanthropocentrism can enlist the resources of biogenetic codes as well as telecom munication new media and information technologies to the task of renewing the Humanities Posthuman subjectivity reshapes the identity of humanistic practices by stressing het eronomy and multifaceted relationality instead of autonomy and selfreferential disciplinary purity The profoundly anthropocentric core of the Humanities is displaced by this complex conﬁ guration of knowledge domi nated by science studies and technological information as I argued in chapters 2 and 3 Far from being a terminal crisis however this challenge opens up new global ecosophical dimensions This posthuman enthusiasm on my part which is not exactly devoid of impatient anticipation stems from my antihumanist and feminist background It produces an energizing but nonetheless critical relationship to the contem porary ﬁ eld of the classical Humanities It would be para doxical to say the least in fact if the critical thinkers who entered the academic institutions in the aftermath of the 1970s cultural revolution with the explicit aim of changing them from within ended up having to simply restore those 2 httpwwwcitizenscienceallianceorg Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory same disciplines and rescue them from institutional decline As I pointed out in the previous chapters things are never clearcut when it comes to developing a consistent posthuman stance and linear thinking may not be the best way to go about it Sam Whimster analyses the dilemma lucidly 2006 174 The Humanities which are a celebration and expressive elu cidation of the human condition as nonreducible to any materialist base have been in retreat since the late 19th century with the emergence of Darwinism as the valid scien tiﬁ c account of the origin of all species of life So a science of the human would seem either to have the capacity to be inhuman or alternatively to be humanistic but hardly scientiﬁ c Whimster also reminds us that French philosophy had addressed the issue of postanthropocentric Humanities and the status of the human in the strikingly original 1748 work by the philosopher Julien La Mettrie 1996 He was a mate rialist humanist in the grand tradition of French enlightened materialism and constitutes a signiﬁ cant early modern prec edent from the ancient archives of the Humanities La Mett ries theory of the inherently mechanical or selforganizing structure of the human is pathbreaking and highly relevant for our own situation Today environmental evolutionary cognitive biogenetic and digital transdisciplinary discursive fronts are emerging around the edges of the classical Humanities and across the disciplines They rest on postanthropocentric premises and technologically mediated emphasis on Life as a zoecentred system of species egalitarianism Braidotti 2006 which are very promising for new research in the ﬁ eld Probably the most signiﬁ cant example of the excellent health enjoyed by the postanthropocentric Humanities is the recent explosion of scholarship in the ﬁ elds of Animal Studies and of Eco criticism The fastchanging ﬁ eld of disability studies is almost emblematic of the posthuman predicament Ever mindful that we do not yet know what a body can do dis ability studies combine the critique of normative bodily models with the advocacy of new creative models of embodi ment Braidotti and Groets 2012 These areas are so rich and fastgrowing that it is impossible to even attempt to sum Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory marize them3 Where do these developments leave the scholar ship in the Humanities Or rather whats the human got to do with this shifting horizon And what are the implications for the future of the Humanities today A contemporary neo vitalist thinker like Elizabeth Grosz pursues this line of research further through a deconstructivist reappraisal of Charles Darwin Grosz 2011 argues that evolutionary theory deﬂ ated humanist pretensions and was a precursor of the crisis of human exceptionalism which has by now become manifest Grosz calls accordingly for the development of inhuman Humanities which consist in speciesequality an emphasis on genetically inscribed sexual difference the primacy of sexual selection and a nonteleological approach to the evolution of the human alongside all other species Although I ﬁ nd Groszs emphasis on the genetic basis of sexual differentiation too rigid for my ﬂ uid nomadic vision of the subject I agree on one important point As a vitalist and selforganizing notion of matter comes to the fore the Humanities need to mutate and become posthuman or to accept sufferings increasing irrelevance As if these postanthropocentric challenges were not enough last but not least comes the fallout of the inhumane aspects of our historical condition which I discussed in chapter 3 According to the tenets of classical Humanism the Humanities were deﬁ ned by their capacity to humanize our social behav iour values and civic interaction This implies an implicit moral mission and concern for the wellbeing of academics students and citizens alike What happens to this claim in an era of posthuman and postanthropocentric shifts of mass migration wars on terror robotized weapons and drones in technologi cally mediated conﬂ icts 3 A companion to Animal Studies has just been published Gross and Vallely 2012 whereas a complete Ecocriticism reader has been available for a while Glotfelty and Fromm 1996 The Journal of Ecocriticism is quite established while a recent issue of the presti gious PMLA papers 2009 was dedicated to the question of the animal For an excellent historical analysis see Joanna Bourke 2011 For the younger generation of scholars Rossini and Tyler 2009 the animal is the posthuman question par excellence The ﬁ eld of disability studies is again too vast to be summarized adequately with an established international Society for Disability Studies which publishes a Quarterly and a complete reader Lenard 1997 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory A clear institutional response to the inhumane structures of our times is the establishment and the proliferation of inter disciplinary areas of study that deal with the disasters of modern and contemporary history Gender feminist and post colonial studies are the prototypes of these new experimental areas which have provided so much in terms of instruments as well as innovative concepts More speciﬁ cally new multidis ciplinary research areas had to be set up to come to terms with the horrors of our times from Holocaust studies to research on slavery and colonialism through to work on the traumatic memories of multiple ideologydriven genocides JF Lyotards idea of the differend 1983  a crime or moral lapse for which there cannot be adequate form of justice let alone of retribu tion or compensation  is relevant to deal with the scale of the catastrophes of our era The differend is the ethical response to the tragedy of the intolerable or the irreconcilable but given that much of this horror is unspeakable how far can the Humanities delve into it Again radical epistemologies such as womens gender queer and feminist studies on the one hand and postcolonial and race studies on the other have played an innovative role in this regard They provide themes and methods to handle the epistemic blast of such horrors and work through their consequence for the role of critical theory They also fulﬁ l a healing function in relation to the legacy of pain and hurt which they entail The proliferation of new discursive ﬁ elds continues after the end of the Cold War when we get the emergence of Centres for Conﬂ ict Studies and Peace Research Humanitarian man agement Human Rightsoriented medicine trauma and recon ciliation studies Death Studies and the list is still growing These are institutional structures that combine pastoral care with a therapeutic function to deal with the inhumane and painful aspects of historical horrors They perpetuate and update the transformative impact of the Humanities in an inhumane context but they do so by exploding the boundaries of classical Humanities disciplines As a result of these multiple domino effects the question of what happens to the Humanities when their implicit assumptions about the Human and the process of humaniza tion can no longer be taken for granted is high on the social and academic agendas Alongside the criticism voiced by posthuman critical thinkers different strands of neo Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory humanism are at work within the contemporary Humanities as we have examined in the previous chapters Taking for instance the case of feminist and race theories as the main point of reference the enduring legacy of Simone de Beau voirs socialist Humanism plays a central role in bringing progressive humanism into the third millennium Other femi nist humanists have also proposed robust alternatives to the crisis of values  such as the neoKantian model of Seyla Benhabib 2002 adapted from Habermas philosophy and her reappraisal of Hannah Arendt 1996 Residual forms of neohumanism already informed by nonWestern assump tions cultural traditions and values come in through post colonial theory as we saw in chapter 1 Hill Collins 1991 Said 2004 Contemporary science studies adopt compensa tory Humanism both to the study of other species de Waal 1996 2006 2009 and to the political analysis of environ mental issues Shiva 1997 The most vocal campaigner for a liberal humanist vision of the contemporary Humanities is Martha Nussbaum who as we saw in chapter 1 ﬁ rmly rejects any critique or decon struction of the ﬁ eld and turns classical humanism into a utopian project still to come 1999 2006 2010 Not for Proﬁ t Nussbaums impassioned defence of the classical Humanities stands out in this context as a noble but also rather unrealistic plea for a status quo ante The vision of the Humanities faculty as a haven of liberal education based on the Kantian notion of the autonomy of rational judgement and the speciﬁ c ethical and aesthetic criteria that go with it is outdated to say the least Moreover because of its privately funded structure it does not even apply to the state education model of the European Union On the practical level it fails to see to what extent faculties of the Humanities are actually proﬁ toriented and make a lot of money for their universities mostly through high student enrolments and intensive teaching Furthermore on the historical front the university ceased to conform to this philosophical vision primarily in the United States but also in the rest of the world in the Cold War period Concerns linked to national security geo political conﬂ icts and international prestige brought the uni versity closer to the military and hence to government control as we saw in chapter 3 After the cultural upheavals of the Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory 1960s the university lost its hegemonic function both as the standard referent for national culture and as the holder of a monopoly over fundamental research which moved to the private sector or to joint enterprises By the time Nussbaum wrote her pamphlet in favour of liberal education the uni versity had already become incorporated into the market economy as an important but by no means unique corporate structure Readings 1996 Therefore instead of turning backwards to a nostalgic vision of the Humanities as the repository and the executors of universal transcendental reason and inherent moral good ness I propose to move forward into multiple posthuman futures We need an active effort to reinvent the academic ﬁ eld of the Humanities in a new global context and to develop an ethical framework worthy of our posthuman times Afﬁ r mation not nostalgia is the road to pursue not the idealiza tion of philosophical metadiscourse but the more pragmatic task of selftransformation through humble experimentation Let me expand on this project in the next section Institutional Patterns of Dissonance The crises of selfdeﬁ nition and public perception of the Humanities have been building up since the end of the 1970s into an institutional debate framed by explicit political factors A recent American study assesses the situation lucidly In addition to the decline of federal funding a shrinking job market and the new pressures of globalization the most sig niﬁ cant internal challenges confronting the Humanities have emerged from the hegemony of techno science the impact of the new media revolution the rise of expert cultures on the one hand and on the other the unprecedented democratic proliferation of new interdisciplinary ﬁ elds such as gender ethnic disability and AfricanAmerican studies as well as studies of nonEuropean cultures all of which put the tradi tional canon and the common mission of the Humanities into question Bono et al 2008 2 The institutional crisis therefore grew beyond issues of self representation to question the dominant paradigm of what constitutes scientiﬁ c knowledge for the contemporary human ists within a university structure that is in ﬂ ux to say the least Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory During the conﬂ ictridden 1990s science wars  also known as theory or culture wars  broke out on the Ameri can campus Arthur and Shapiro 1995 The core of the dispute was precisely the question of differences of paradigm between the Humanities and the natural sciences French Con tinental philosophy and especially poststructuralism were tar geted for particular hostility under the general charge of political correctness Bérubé and Nelson 1995 Militant antipoststructuralist scientists like Socal and Bricmont 1998 accused the Humanities of scientiﬁ c inadequacy and downright ignorance with disastrous effects for the morale of the ﬁ eld They have encouraged the bynow familiar reaction of dis missal of the Humanities through the intellectually lazy charge of moral and cognitive relativism This was deﬁ nitely the lowest point in the contemporary relationship between the two cultures And yet against these vulgar simpliﬁ cations I maintain that it is important to acknowledge the productive contribution that poststructuralism and other critical theories have made to a renewal of the ﬁ eld of the Humanities Foucault argued back in the 1970s that the Humanities as we have come to know them are structured by an implicit set of humanistic assump tions about Man which are historically framed and contextu ally deﬁ ned in spite of their universalistic pretensions As an empiricaltranscendental doublet Man is framed by the struc tures of Life Labour and Language as constant workin progress This is no manifesto for relativism but rather as Rabinow 2003 114 puts it a call for a renewed problema tization of anthropos The changing conditions of our historicity are responsible for the decline of humanist Man To blame poststructuralism for breaking the bad news is to mistake the messenger for the message In Foucaults 1970 ironical terms this death is not a form of extinction but rather a historically speciﬁ c mode of endurance on the part of exMan after the anthropological exodus we examined in chapter 2 With her customary insight and wit Gayatri Spivak 1987 denounced this death as the weakened but nonetheless hegemonic modus vivendi of Euro centric exMan The fact that critical theory has been coming to terms with endless deaths since then ranging from the death Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory of Man to that of the universal of the nation state the end of history and of ideology down to the disappearance of the printed book bears testimony to the sagacity of Spivaks remark What has emerged as a potentially fatal ﬂ aw at the core of the Humanities is their structural anthropomorphism and perennial methodological nationalism Beck 2007 as my hostile colleague from the natural sciences pointed out in the fourth vignette I quoted in the introduction The former trans lates into sustained hostility towards or genuine incompatibil ity with the culture practice and institutional existence of science and technology The latter challenges the Humanities ability to cope with two of the distinctive features of our times ﬁ rstly the scientiﬁ c rise of Life sciences and technologically mediated communication and knowledge transfer and sec ondly the need to take into account cultural diversity notably between different geopolitical areas but also within each one of them This criticism hurts especially in view of the political context The European Union at present is dominated by a rightwing agenda of neoliberal economics on the one hand and xenophobic populist social and cultural agendas on the other As a result the university as an institution and the Humanities especially are under attack They are accused of being unproductive narcissistic and oldfashioned in their approach and also of being out of touch with contemporary science and technology culture The Humanities are therefore experiencing at ﬁ rst hand the crisis of Man that has been theorized by the very radical philosophies like poststructural ism and by feminist and postcolonial interdisciplinary studies which were often marginalized in the university institutional settings The Humanities are often forced into a defensive position The issue of methodological nationalism is crucial in that it is inbuilt into the European Humanities selfrepresentation Edward Said reminded us that Humanism must shed its smug Eurocentrism and become an adventure in difference and alter native cultural traditions This shift of perspectives requires a prior consciousnessraising on the part of Humanities scholars Humanists must recognize with some alarm that the politics of identity and the nationalistically grounded system of educa Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory tion remain at the core of what most of us actually do despite changed boundaries and objects of research Said 2004 55 We shall see later how the changed institutional structure of the contemporary university both rests upon the decline of the nationstate as the horizon for research and has the potential to contribute to a postnational perspective To return to the main point of my current argument I fully endorse the call for an epistemological turn in the Humanities so as to enable them to clarify their own knowledge production processes and consequently become better equipped to help clarify those of others There are however some serious obsta cles to this worthy project The ﬁ rst is the lack of a tradition of epistemological selfreﬂ exivity in the ﬁ eld Linked to this is the deplorable persistence of an introverted culture of disciplin ary insularity unthinking Eurocentrism and anthropocentrism Few of these institutional habits of the Humanities are really conducive to epistemological selfscrutiny The ﬁ eld further more tends to be unable to resist the fatal attraction of the gravitational pull back to Humanism Only a serious mutation can therefore help the Humanities to grow out of some of their entrenched bad habits This requires a number of new perspec tives but over and above these formal criteria I think the Humanities need to ﬁ nd the inspirational courage to move beyond an exclusive concern for the human be it humanistic or anthropocentric Man and to embrace more planetary intel lectual challenges The Humanities in the Twentyﬁ rst Century I have argued in the previous section that the identity crisis of the contemporary Humanities is related to the high levels of technological mediation and the multicultural structure of the globalized world This places the issue of the relationship between the two cultures  the Humanities and the Sciences  at the centre of the debate In a critical evaluation of the contemporary situation Roberts and Mackenzie 2006 argue for a variety of robust and constructive institutional alternatives to the rather unre solved and often conﬂ ictridden relationship between the Humanities and the Sciences in the third millennium One Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory useful strategy aims at identifying points of compatibility between the two cultures and points out the role played by cultural representation images and literary devices  all of them drawn from the subtle a term that I ﬁ nd vastly prefer able to the derogatory soft sciences  in the making of pub licly acclaimed science For instance Gillian Beers 1983 study of evolutionary narratives was positively pathbreaking in this respect and it was brilliantly pursued by studies of literary Darwinism Carroll 2004 Working within scientiﬁ c culture Evelyn Fox Keller 1995 2002 is a pioneer of a different kind producing a series of key texts to illustrate the complementary nature of humanistic knowledge and empirical science The study of Barbara McClintocks life and work Keller 1983 is especially relevant in that it demonstrates the contiguity between cultural insights spiritual resources and experimental science Another angle of approach to the question of the two cul tures today focuses on the function of visualization in science Stephen Jay Gould and Rosamond Purcell 2000 pioneered the dialogue between art and science by a sophisticated inter play of images and scientiﬁ c information This tradition was brought to new heights by the collaborative interdisciplinary work on picturing science and the arts by Carrie Jones and Peter Galison 1998 The ﬁ eld is large and wellendowed with talents that range from the political analysis of the scientiﬁ c gaze Keller 1985 Jordanova 1989 Braidotti 1994 to the cultural history of photography and new media Lury 1998 Zylinska 2009 Crossover studies of the visual arts in rela tion to the physical and biological sciences are also crucial as Barbara Stafford has brilliantly demonstrated 1999 2007 Anthropology has played an inspirational role in the study of science starting from agendasetting pioneers like Marilyn Strathern 1992 to Paul Rabinows Foucauldian take on the Life sciences 2003 and Rayna Rapps combination of politi cal and epistemic elements in the analysis of biotechnologies 2000 Henrietta Moores analyses of subject formations span across the decades of poststructuralism to provide the most consistent insights about the entanglements of bodies psychic landscapes cultures and technologies 1994 2007 2011 Feminist epistemology and social studies of sciences posit feminist theory as the missing link between science studies Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory and epistemological political subjectivity with intellectual pioneers like Donna Haraway 1988 Sandra Harding 1991 1993 Isabelle Stengers 1987 2000 Lisa Cartwright 2001 Mette Bryld and Nina Lykke 1999 and Annemarie Mol 2002 The social studies of science also proved very innova tive as evidenced by the work of Fraser et al 2006 Maureen McNeils shrewd political analyses of technology 2007 and Sarah Franklins pathbreaking work on Dolly the sheep 2007 Cultural studies of science have also been crucial as in Jackie Staceys brilliant analysis of the social and therapeutic cultures of cancer 1997 and of the cinematic life of genetics 2010 The ﬁ eld of media studies has produced an astonishing amount of highquality research on science and technology as testiﬁ ed by the work of Jonathan Crary 2001 and the Zone Books series which brought French theory and philosophy of science to large American audiences Jose van Dijcks analyses of digital culture are pathbreaking 2007 Smelik and Lykke 2008 opened up the ﬁ eld to a variety of original interventions on the interdisciplinary structures of contemporary science and its embedded cultural and social aspects We are confronted therefore by a sort of embarrassment of riches in new discourses about the current relationship between the Sciences and the Humanities and I regret that I cannot pursue a more detailed analysis of the ﬁ elds I have outlined For the moment apart from praising the range and quality of these new areas of scholarship I want to draw several con clusions Firstly that such a wealth of innovative interdisciplin ary scholarship in and across the Humanities is an expression of the vitality of this ﬁ eld not of its crisis Secondly that much of this new research is conducted in those experimental inter disciplinary areas of studies that I have highlighted through out this book as a major source of inspiration Thirdly that they are epistemologically grounded and consequently they enable the contemporary Humanities to clarify their own methods and mechanisms of knowledge production However the very interdisciplinary nature of these new research areas does not facilitate the task of providing a new synthesis of the ﬁ eld This wealth of approaches therefore reopens the old question of the generic identity of the Humanities as a discipline Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory Commenting on this lack of unity in the discursive practice of the Humanities Rabinow remarks 2003 4 No consensus has ever been reached about principles methods and modes of problem speciﬁ cation or    principles of veri ﬁ cation or about forms of narration in the human sciences It is important to stress however that this disunity points to overabundance not lack As a result anthropos is that being who suffers from too many logoi 2003 6 This is especially true in the context of contemporary scientiﬁ c and technological advances which have contributed to even more heterogeneous discourses Their heterogeneity is such that they are incapable of providing an overarching theory of technological self representation They consequently push even further the disag gregation of the discursive unity of anthropos which has proved very creative in adapting to this scientiﬁ c exuberance Perhaps the Humanities have a different relationship to com plexity than the Natural and Life sciences Lorraine Daston 2004 acknowledges the range and quality of these resources and disciplinary precedents She also empha sizes the importance of culture and interpretation to the making of science Daston shows that hermeneutical frameworks are not only embedded in all sorts of disciplines close to the Humanities  notably the social sciences law and the Life sci ences  but are also playing a key role in society at large and are present in all decisionmaking processes Daston therefore encourages humanists to make a bigger effort to explain to the outside world how we know what we know Arguing that the scholarship on epistemology and philosophy of science is slanted in favour of the natural sciences she calls for an epis temology of knowledge practices by humanists This will result in explaining what counts as a scientiﬁ c discovery or just a ﬁ nding for the Humanities with attention to process and praxis as opposed to an exclusive focus on the objects of knowledge Although this is very important and necessary I think that the very nature of data collection in the Humanities clashes with the methods of the natural or Life sciences in that it is based on lived experience and tends towards complexity not quantiﬁ cation In a European context moreover other factors Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory need to be factored in for instance the multilingual structure of research and thinking in the Humanities This means that research practice differs considerably in terms of not only geo graphical but also temporal locations across Europe and beyond Is it then fair to ask this rich and internally differenti ated ﬁ eld to conform to a different research paradigm While the calls for the Humanities to develop some bio literacy and cybernautical skills gather force the resistance remains great both in the Humanities and in the larger sci entiﬁ c community In the meantime the old citation indexes are fast being replaced by Google searches and endless attempts to develop a metric system suited to the research culture of the Humanities is more urgent but also more problematic than ever A new relationship is being estab lished between arts and sciences under our very but the question is whether the Humanities  which have so much to offer  are at all entitled to set the rules of this new institu tional game or whether they are merely asked to conform to rules that were not designed with their best interests in mind The missing links of this dialogue are manifold and they collide over the very deﬁ nition of the posthuman If we postanthropocentric posthumanists not hyphenated and nonunitary subjects are to strike a note of resonance in both scientiﬁ c communities we need to insist on a culture of mutual respect Cultural and social studies of science need to address their resistance to theories of the subject while phi losophies of the subject on the other hand would be advised to confront their mistrust and miscognition of biosciences Posthuman times call for posthuman Humanities studies The issue of the status of theory is implicit in this discussion In response to the current debate on the two cultures Peter Galison 2004 welcomes the end of grand systematic theoreti cal discourse and echoing Lyotards point about the decline of master narratives calls for speciﬁ c theory This means a posi tion between universalistic pretensions of standing outside space and time on the one hand and narrow empiricism on the other Speciﬁ c theory is grounded accountable but also shareable and hence open to generic applications This approach offers both epistemic and ethical advantages which can be immediately put to good use I think for instance that one of the most effective strategies developed by contemporary Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory Humanities scholars is to actually theorize via and with science This methodological and strategic choice is based on the insight of poststructuralism about the parallelism of all discursive and textual practices The textual egalitarianism which was intro duced by the semiotic and linguistic turn of the 1970s  and has shocked and irritated conservative scholars ever since  paved the way for new dialogues and interventions between the subtle and the hard sciences A new science theory has been perfected accordingly4 which I have referred to as the matterrealist trend in chapter 2 The matterrealists combine the legacy of poststructuralist antihumanism with the rejection of the classical opposition materialismidealism to move towards Life as a non essentialist brand of contemporary vitalism and as a complex system I argue that the Humanities must adapt to the chang ing structure of materialism itself notably the fact that it is based on a new concept of matter and is both affective and autopoietic or selforganizing Karen Barads work on agential realism Barad 2003 2007 is an eminent example of this tendency By choosing to bypass the binary between the material and the cultural agential realism focuses on the process of their interaction The focus on materialcultural processes allows us to better interrogate the boundaries between them This results in emphasizing an ethics of knowledge that reﬂ ects and respects complexity and also renews the practice of critical reﬂ exivity Luciana Parisi 2004 also innovates on complexity theory building on Felix Guattaris work She emphasizes that the great advantage of vitalist monism is that it deﬁ nes nature culture as a continuum which evolves through ecology of differentiation The nonsemiotic codes the DNA of all genetic material intersect with complex assemblages of affects embodied practices and other performances that include but are not conﬁ ned to the linguistic realm Parisi strengthens this case by crossreferring to the new epistemol 4 This trend includes thinkers like Ansell Pearson 1997 1999 Massumi 2002 De Landa 2002 Barad 2007 Grosz 2004 Colebrook 2000 2002 Bennett 2001 2010 Clough 2008 Protevi 2009 and Braidotti 1994 2011b Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory ogy of Margulis and Sagan 1995 through the concept of endosymbiosis which like autopoiesis indicates a creative form of evolution This means that the genetic material is exposed to processes of becoming freed from ontological foundations for difference but is not conﬁ ned by social constructivism In matterrealist Humanities research primacy is given to the relation over the terms which foregrounds the transversal connections among material and symbolic concrete and dis cursive entities or forces which include nonhuman Life This is what I call zoe itself Braidotti 2006 and chapters 2 and 3 which allows us to approach science as an object of human istic study and viceversa by transcending both ﬁ elds in a transversal redeﬁ nition of what counts as the subject of posthu man scientiﬁ c practice The theoretical advantage of the matterrealist monistic and vital approach is the ability to account for the ﬂ uid work ings of power in advanced or cognitive capitalism also known as information or network society by grounding them in speciﬁ c locations and immanent relations This allows us to resist them by the same means Posthuman thinkers embrace creatively the challenge of our historicity without giving in to cognitive panic The argument is straightforward if the proper study of mankind used to be Man and the proper study of humanity was the human it seems to follow that the proper study of the posthuman condition is the posthuman itself This new knowing subject is a complex assemblage of human and nonhuman planetary and cosmic given and manufactured which requires major readjustments in our ways of thinking This is not as abstract as it may sound at ﬁ rst Let me give some concrete examples The ﬁ rst is the fastgrowing ﬁ eld of environmental Human ities inspired by the awareness that human activity has a geological inﬂ uence Also known as sustainable Humanities Braidotti 2006 and as anthropocene Humanities5 this interdisciplinary ﬁ eld of study introduces major methodologi cal as well as theoretical innovations For one thing it spells the end of the idea of a denaturalized social order discon 5 I am indebted to Debjani Ganguly and Poul Holm for this felici tous formulation Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory nected from its environmental and organic foundations and calls for more complex schemes of understanding the multi layered form of interdependence we all live in Secondly it stresses the speciﬁ c contribution of the Humanities to the public debate on climate change through the analysis of the social and cultural factors that underscore the public repre sentation of these issues Both the scale and the consequences of climate change are so momentous as to defy representa tion Humanities and more speciﬁ cally cultural research are best suited to ﬁ ll in this deﬁ cit of the social imaginary and help us think the unthinkable The impact of the environmental Humanities is even further reaching In his analysis of the implications of climate change research for the discipline of history Dipesh Chakrab arty 2009 argues for a more conceptual shift towards Deep History This is an interdisciplinary combination of geologi cal and socioeconomic history that focuses both on the plan etary or earth factors and on the cultural changes that have jointly created humanity over hundreds of thousands of years It combines theories of historical subjectivity with species thinking This is in my eyes a postanthropocentric conﬁ gu ration of knowledge that grants the earth the same role and agency as the human subjects that inhabit it As I indicated in chapter 2 this involves changes in our understanding of the temporality of history because we are contemplating the possibility of human and other species extinction and hence the end of recorded historical human time and also the end of the future The collapse of the divide between human and natural histories is a very recent phenomenon and prior to this fundamental shift geological time and the chronology of humans were unrelated at least within the discipline of history In fact historians and climate change research ran parallel discussions without real interdisciplinary exchanges All of this is changing under our very eyes The scale of these mental shifts is such as to almost defy representation as I suggested above Chakrabarty suggests further critical reﬂ ection on the difference between the present historiography of globalization and the historiogra phy demanded by anthropogenic theories of climate change 2009 216 This forces us to bring together categories of thought which were until now kept apart not only by disci Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory plinary boundaries  between the earth sciences and literature and history for instance  but also by the anthropocentric bias that has sustained the Humanities Far from being a crisis this new development has enormous inspirational force for the ﬁ eld It also calls into question some of the current ideas about the negative formation of a new sense of the human as bound together by shared vulnerability in relation to the possibility of extinction Chakrabartys insights about a critical climate changedriven Deep History also challenge some of the given assumptions about postcolonial critiques of the Western universal Quite a programme Another illuminating example of the advantages of a post human scientiﬁ c position is the One Health Initiative which deﬁ nes its mission in terms of Public Health as follows6 Recognizing that human health including mental health via the humananimal bond phenomenon animal health and ecosystem health are inextricably linked One Health seeks to promote improve and defend the health and wellbeing of all species by enhancing cooperation and collaboration between physicians veterinarians other scientiﬁ c health and environmental professionals and by promoting strengths in leadership and management to achieve these goals The movement is inspired by Rudolf Virchow 18211902 who coined the term zoonosis arguing that there should be no dividing lines between animal and human medicine This position has been gathering momentum in the last ﬁ fteen years The One Health Initiative is a rather daring interdisci plinary alliance that unites physicians osteopaths veteri narians dentists nurses and other scientiﬁ chealth and environmentally related disciplines on the basis of a simple hypothesis which is the isomorphism of structures between humans and animals in immunology bacteriology and vaccine developments This means that humans are both exposed and vulnerable to new diseases like bird ﬂ u and other epidemics which they share with animal species Obviously a response to the new pandemics that have emerged in the global era like Bovine 6 httpwwwonehealthinitiativecommissionphp with thanks to my colleague Anton Pijpers Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory spongiform encephalopathy BSE better known as mad cow disease the One Health Initiative stresses the variety of shared diseases that tie humans and animals For instance animals suffer from many of the same chronic diseases such as heart disease cancer diabetes asthma and arthritis as humans It follows therefore that we should develop com parative medicine as the study of disease processes across species and that therefore we should also connect doctors and veterinarians in their daily practices both therapeutic and researchbased Environmentally embedded the One Health Initiative pursues both ecological and social sustainability and has large social repercussions The common concerns about public health among humans and animals is intensiﬁ ed as a result of urbanization global ization climate change wars and terrorism and microbial and chemical pollution of land and water Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory our and other species the semiotic systems of technological apparatus the processes of translation underscoring the Digital Humanities the role of gender and ethnicity as factors that index access to the posthuman predicament and the institutional implications of them all This is a new and inno vative agenda which builds on but is not conﬁ ned to either humanism or anthropocentrism  a genuinely new programme for the Humanities in the twentieth century At the experimental level several new interdisciplinary posthuman studies research platforms have been set up across major universities and are running pathbreaking experi ments as this book goes to press8 As a consequence of this embarrassment of theoretical and research riches the next question that arises is how can the Humanities be inspired by these experiments in posthuman thought and new post anthropocentric research How can they adopt this approach to their own object of study Posthuman Critical Theory The Humanities can be inspired by these new transdisciplin ary models of thought The key to everything for me lies in the methodology and therefore I want to spell out the main criteria for posthuman theory as a way of unfolding the new rules of the game and try to apply them to the Humanities My golden rules are cartography accuracy with the corollary of ethical accountability transdisciplinarity the importance of combining critique with creative ﬁ gurations the principle of nonlinearity the powers of memory and the imagination and the strategy of defamiliarization These methodological guidelines are valuable not only as building blocks for post human critical theory but also because they can help redeﬁ ne 8 See for instance the Posthumanities Hub at the university of Linköping funded by the Swedish government httpwwwtema liusetemagPosthumanNetworklen research conducted at the Institute of Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Bern in Switzerland experiments at the Uni versity of East London in the UK and my work at the Centre for the Humanities at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory the relationship between the Humanities and the Life sciences on the basis of mutual respect Let us begin with cartographic accuracy A cartography is a theoretically based and politically informed reading of the present Cartographies aim at epistemic and ethical account ability by unveiling the power locations which structure our subjectposition As such they account for ones locations in terms of both space geopolitical or ecological dimension and time historical and genealogical dimension This stresses the situated structure of critical theory and it implies the partial or limited nature of all claims to knowledge These qualiﬁ cations are crucial to support the critique of both uni versalism and of liberal individualism Critiques of power locations however are not enough They work in tandem with the quest for alternative ﬁ gura tions or conceptual personae for these locations in terms of power as restrictive potestas but also as empowering or afﬁ rmative potentia For example ﬁ gurations such as the feministthe womanistthe queerthe cyborgthe diasporic native nomadic subjects as well as oncomouse and Dolly the sheep are no mere metaphors but signposts for speciﬁ c geo political and historical locations As such they express complex singularities not universal claims Braidotti 2011a A ﬁ guration is the expression of alternative representations of the subject as a dynamic nonunitary entity it is the dra matization of processes of becoming These processes assume that subject formation takes place inbetween naturetechnol ogy malefemale blackwhite localglobal presentpast  in the spaces that ﬂ ow and connect the binaries These inbetween states defy the established modes of theoretical representation because they are zigzagging not linear and processoriented not conceptdriven Critique and creation strike a new deal in actualizing the practice of conceptual personae or ﬁ gura tion as the active pursuit of afﬁ rmative alternatives to the dominant vision of the subject Zigzagging is indeed the operative word for the next build ing block of posthuman critical theory namely nonlinearity It would be selfdefeating for the Humanities to stick to the traditional rule of visualization by automatically adopting linear thinking considering the complexity of contemporary science and the fact that the global economy does not func Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory tion in a linear manner but is rather weblike scattered and polycentred The heteroglossia of data we are confronted with demands complex topologies of knowledge for a subject structured by multidirectional relationality We consequently need to adopt nonlinearity to develop cartographies of power that account for the paradoxes of the posthuman era This issue gets even more complex in relation to time Linearity is the dominant time of Chronos as opposed to the dynamic and more cyclical time of becoming or Aion as we saw in chapter 2 The former is the keeper of institutional time and practices  Royal science the latter the prerogative of marginal groups  minor science Ofﬁ cial Chronos driven Royal science is opposed to the process of becoming minor of science which is based on a different temporality One is protocolbound the other is curiositydriven and deﬁ nes the scientiﬁ c enterprise in terms of the creation of new concepts Nomadic theory proposes a critique of the powers that dominant linear memorysystems exercise over the Humanities and social sciences Creativity and critique proceed together in the quest for afﬁ rmative alternatives which rest on a nonlinear vision of memory as imagination creation as becoming Instead of deference to the authority of the past we have the ﬂ eeting copresence of multiple time zones in a continuum that activates and deterritorializes stable identities and fractures temporal linearity Deleuze 1988 This dynamic vision of time enlists the creative resources of the imagination to the task of reconnecting to the past Nonlinearity also affects scholarly practice in the Human ities disciplines  a method that replaces linearity with a more rhizomatic style of thinking allows for multiple connections and lines of interaction that necessarily connect the text to its many outsides This method expresses the conviction that the truth of a text is never really written anywhere let alone within the signifying space of the book Nor is it about the authority of a proper noun a signature a tradition a canon or the prestige of an academic discipline The truth of a text requires an altogether different form of account ability and accuracy that resides in the transversal nature of the affects they engender that is to say the outwardbound interconnections or relations they enable and sustain George Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory Eliot pointed the way by writing with ears and mind open to that roar of energy that sustains Life Virginia Woolf did the same by steering her writers gaze towards the perfect stillness of Life deﬁ ned as constant ﬂ ow Writing is a method for transcribing cosmic intensity into sustainable portions of being This has important implications for the task of criticism As poststructuralism taught us Barthes 1975 the method of faithfulness to the text and of citation is more than ﬂ at repetition without difference What comes to the fore instead is the creative capacity that consists in being able to re member and to endure the affective charges of texts as events To do so loyalty is due neither to the spurious depth of the text nor to the authors latent or manifest intentionality and even less to the sovereignty of the phallic Master signiﬁ er A text theoretical and scientiﬁ c as well as literary is a relay point between different moments in space and time as well as different levels degrees forms and conﬁ gurations of the thinking process It is a mobile entity a speedjet Thinking and writing like breathing are not held into the mould of linearity or the conﬁ nes of the printed page but move out wards out of bounds in webs of encounters with ideas others texts The linguistic signiﬁ er is merely one of the points in a chain of effects not its centre or its endgame The source of intellectual inspiration comes from the neverending ﬂ ow of connections between the texts and their multiple outsides Creativity constantly reconnects to the virtual totality of a block of past experiences memories and affects which in a monistic philosophy of becoming get recomposed as action or praxis in the present This approach to critical thinking is an exercise in synchronization which sustains activity here and now by making concrete or actual the virtual intensity This intensity is simultaneously after and before us both past and future in a ﬂ ow or process of muta tion differentiation or becoming It is the matterrealist core of critical thought Nomadic thought encourages an affective openingout towards the geophilosophical or planetary dimension of chaosmosis Guattari 1995 It amounts to turning the thinking subject into the threshold of gratuitous principle of nonproﬁ t aimless principle of mobility or ﬂ ow acts which Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory express the vital energy of transformative becoming principle of nonlinearity Loyalty is instead required to the intensity of the affective forces that compose a text or a concept so as to account for what a text  or a concept or theory  can do what it has done how it has impacted upon ones self and others Accounting for the affective impact of various items or data upon oneself is the process of remembering In Bergson as in Deleuze it has as much to do with the imagina tion that is to say creative reworking as with the passive repetition of chronologically prior recorded and hence retrievable experiences Implicit in this process is the next key criterion for posthu man critical theory which is the role of memory Considering that posthuman time is a complex and nonlinear system internally fractured and multiplied over several time sequences affect and memory become essential elements Freed from chronological linearity and the logocentric gravi tational force memory in the posthuman nomadic mode is the active reinvention of a self that is joyfully discontinuous as opposed to being mournfully consistent Memories need the imagination to empower the actualization of virtual possibilities in the subject which becomes redeﬁ ned as a transversal relational entity inhabited by a vitalist and multi directional memory Rothberg 2009 Memory works in terms of nomadic transpositions that is to say as creative and highly generative interconnections which mix and match mingle and multiply the possibilities of expansion and rela tions among different units or entities Braidotti 2006 The next methodological signpost is the practice of de familiarization which I discussed in chapters 2 and 3 This is a sobering process by which the knowing subject disen gages itself from the dominant normative vision of the self he or she had become accustomed to to evolve towards a post human frame of reference Leaving the Vitruvian frame once and for all the subject becomes relational in a complex manner that connects it to multiple others A subject thus constituted explodes the boundaries of humanism and anthro pocentrism at skin level We have seen in the previous chap ters a series of concrete examples of how disidentiﬁ cations from dominant models of subjectformation can be produc tive and creative drawn from feminist theory  which implies Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory a radical disengagement from the dominant institutions and representations of femininity and masculinity Braidotti 1991 Butler 1991 Postcolonial and race discourse disrupt white privilege and other racialized assumptions about accepted views of what constitutes a human subject9 These disidentiﬁ cations occur along the axes of becoming woman sexualization and becomingother racialization and hence remain within the conﬁ nes of anthropomorphism Yet a more radical shift is needed to break from the latter and develop postanthropocentric forms of identiﬁ cation The unbearable lightness of being falls upon us as soon as we start running with zoe nonhuman life itself Nomadic theorys vital geocentrism  the love of zoe  is a parallel effort in the same direction Becomingearth or becoming imperceptible are more radical breaks with established pat terns of thought naturalization and introduce a radically imminent planetary dimension This anthropological exodus is especially difﬁ cult emotionally as well as methodologically as it can involve a sense of loss and pain Disidentiﬁ cation involves the loss of cherished habits of thought and represen tation a move which can also produce fear sense of insecu rity and nostalgia On the methodological front defamiliarization shifts the relationship to the nonhuman others and requires dis identiﬁ cation from centuryold habits of anthropocentric thought and humanist arrogance which is likely to test the ability and willingness of the Humanities The hard or experimental sciences of course are accomplishing this move away from anthropocentrism with relative ease as we saw in the case of the Deep History or the One Health research movements It may be worth taking seriously the critical charge that the Humanities development towards complexity may be hampered by the anthropocentrism that underscores their practice Will critical theory be able to connect to rich and complex postHumanities to come My working deﬁ nition of a posthuman scientiﬁ c method in the Humanities as well as in the Life sciences cannot be dissociated from an ethics of inquiry that demands respect 9 See Gilroy 2000 Hill Collins 1991 Ware 1992 and Grifﬁ n and Braidotti 2002 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory for the complexities of the reallife world we are living in Posthuman critical theory needs to apply a new vision of subjectivity to both the practice and the public perception of the scientist which is still caught in the classical and out moded model of the humanistic Man of reason Lloyd 1984 as the quintessential European citizen We need to overcome this model and move towards an intensive form of interdisciplinarity transversality and boundarycrossings among a range of discourses This transdisciplinary approach affects the very structure of thought and enacts a rhizomatic embrace of conceptual diversity in scholarship The posthu man method amounts to higher degrees of disciplinary hybridization and relies on intense defamiliarization of our habits of thought through encounters that shatter the ﬂ at repetition of the protocols of institutional reason The Proper Subject of the Humanities is not Man I have argued throughout this book that posthuman theory rests on a process ontology that challenges the traditional equation of subjectivity with rational consciousness resisting the reduction of both to objectivity and linearity10 The nomadic vision of the posthuman knowing subject as a time continuum and a collective assemblage implies a double com mitment on the one hand to processes of change and on the other to a strong ethics of ecosophical sense of community Copresence that is to say the simultaneity of being in the world together deﬁ nes the ethics of interaction with both human and nonhuman others A collectively distributed con sciousness emerges from this a transversal form of non synthetic understanding of the relational bond that connects us This places the relation and the notion of complexity at the centre of both the ethics and the epistemic structures and strategies of the posthuman subject Braidotti 2006 This view has important implications for the production of scientiﬁ c knowledge The dominant vision of the scientiﬁ c 10 For an excellent critical account of the notion of objectivity see Daston and Galison 2007 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory enterprise is based on the institutional implementation of a number of Laws that discipline the practice of scientiﬁ c research and police the thematic and methodological borders of what counts as respectable acceptable and fundable science In so doing the laws of scientiﬁ c practice regulate what a mind is allowed to do and thus they control the structures of our thinking Posthuman thought proposes an alternative vision of both the thinking subject of his or her evolution on the planetary stage and the actual structure of thinking Deleuze and Guattaris idea that the task of thinking is to create new concepts is a great source of inspiration for the Humanities because it rests on the parallelism between philosophy science and the arts This is not to be mistaken for a ﬂ attening out of the differences between these intellec tual pursuits but rather a way of stressing the unity of purpose among the three branches of knowledge Deleuze and Guattari take care to stress the differences between the distinctive styles of intelligence that philosophy science and the arts respectively embody They also argue that they remain indexed on a common plane of intensive selftransforming Life energy This continuum sustains the ontology of becom ing that is the conceptual motor of posthuman nomadic thought In so far as science has to come to terms with the real physical processes of an actualized and deﬁ ned world it is less open to the processes of becoming or differentiation that characterize Deleuzes monistic ontology Philosophy is at an advantage being a subtler tool for the probing intellect one that is more attuned to the virtual plane of immanence to the generative force of a generative universe or chaosmo sis which is nonhuman and in constant ﬂ ux Thinking is the conceptual counterpart of the ability to enter modes of relation to affect and be affected sustaining qualitative shifts and creative tensions accordingly which is also the prerogative of art Critical theory therefore has a major role to play Manuel De Landa 2002 analyses brilliantly the intensive mode of Deleuzian science and stresses the crucial importance of processes of actualization of virtual possibilities over and above universal essence and linear realizations De Landa points out that apart from the antiessentialism intensive Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory nomad science also aims to avoid typological thinking The ruling principle of resemblance identity analogy and opposi tion has to be avoided in thinking about the virtual and intensive becoming Deleuze demands that we give an account of that which allows making such judgements or establishing those relations De Landa 2002 42 The important aspect of nomadic vitalism is that it is neither organicist nor essentialist but pragmatic and imma nent In other words vital materialism does not assume an overarching concept of life just practices and ﬂ ows of becoming complex assemblages and heterogeneous relations As I argued in chapter 2 there is no idealized transcendental but virtual multiplicity The monistic ontology that sustains this vision of life as vitalist selforganizing matter also allows the critical thinker to reunite the different branches of phi losophy the sciences and the arts in a new alliance I see this as a dynamic contemporary formula to redeﬁ ne the relation ship between the two cultures of the subtle Humanities and hard Natural sciences They are different lines of approaching the vital matter that constitutes the core of both subjectivity and its planetary and cosmic relations Bonta and Protevi 2004 stress that Deleuzes geo philosophy encourages the Humanities to engage with con temporary biology and physics in very creative ways The emphasis falls on complexity in distinguishing between actu alized states and virtual becoming  on the basis of a vision of matter as autopoietic The former constitute the object of Royal Science the latter the frame for minor science both are necessary at different points in time but only minor science is ethically transformative and not bound to the economic imperatives of advanced capitalism and its cogni tive excursions into living matter As a consequence one can venture the preliminary conclusion that the main implication of posthuman critical theory for the practice of science is that the scientiﬁ c Laws need to be retuned according to a view of the subject of knowledge as a complex singularity an affec tive assemblage and a relational vitalist entity It follows from all this that the Humanities in the posthu man era of anthropocene should not stick to the Human  let alone Man  as its proper object of study On the contrary the ﬁ eld would beneﬁ t by being free from the Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory empire of humanist Man so as to be able to access in a post anthropocentric manner issues of external and even planetary importance such as scientiﬁ c and technological advances ecological and social sustainability and the multiple chal lenges of globalization Such a change of focus requires assis tance from other social and scientiﬁ c actors as well The question is whether the Humanities are allowed to set their own agenda in relation to contemporary science and technology or whether they are conﬁ ned to places they did not choose to be in the ﬁ rst place There is in fact a distinct tendency for instance in the public debates about climate change or biotechnologies to assign to the institutionally underfunded ﬁ eld of the Humanities all subjects related to the human component of these complex debates This ten dency has made the institutional fortunes of ethics which is expected  and often claims itself the prerogative  to issue new metadiscourses and normative injunctions suited to the dilemmas of our age This metadiscursive claim however is unsubstantiated Moreover it perpetuates the institutional ized habit of thought  reactive and sedentary  of erecting philosophy to the role of a master theory The image of the philosopher as the legislator of knowledge and the judge of truth  a model rooted in the Kantian school  is the exact opposite of what posthuman critical theory is arguing for postidentitarian nonunitary and transversal subjectivity based on relations with human and nonhuman others Another discursive ﬁ eld that gets regularly evoked as the single responsibility of the Humanities is the controversial issue of the social and cultural aspects of complex issues such as climate change or the impact of biotechnologies In other words the Humanities are actively conﬁ ned to the anthropocentric corner while being simultaneously blamed for this limitation which is the perfect illustration of the paradox noted by Whimster 2006 174 a science of the human would seem either to have the capacity to be inhuman or alternatively to be humanistic but hardly scientiﬁ c Damned if you do damned if you dont My point is that the Humanities need to embrace the mul tiple opportunities offered by the posthuman condition The Humanities can set their own objects of enquiry free from the traditional or institutional assignment to the human and Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory its humanistic derivatives We know by now that the ﬁ eld is richly endowed with an archive of multiple possibilities which equip it with the methodological and theoretical resources to set up original and necessary debates with the sciences and technologies and other grand challenges of today The ques tion is what the Humanities can become in the posthuman era and after the decline of the primacy of Man and of anthropos The Global Multiversity The question now is what is the institutional practice best suited to posthuman critical theory and to the twentyﬁ rst century Humanities The discussions about the Humanities ability to cope with the challenges of the third millennium beg the question of the crisis of the university as idea and as representation A brief historical survey of the debate about the idea of the university can give an idea of the extent of this crisis The Renaissance model of the Humanist academy deﬁ ned by the scholar as an artist or artisan handcrafting his or her research patiently and without constraints over a long period of time is simply over It has been replaced by a modern Fordist model of the university as a chainproduction unit mass producing academic good Nussbaums claim 1999 that this model is still carried on today by the American Liberal Arts college is both elitist and nostalgic as I mentioned in chapter 2 Immanuel Kants classical text on The conﬂ icts of the faculties ﬁ rst published in 1789 Kant 1992 presents the blueprint for the modern university based on the model of industrial production Kant divided the university into higher faculties  Law Medicine and Theology  which are practi cally oriented and lower faculties  the Arts Humanities and Sciences  which are responsible for criticism and hence are withdrawn from markets and practical concerns11 This blueprint is still quite valid in spite of several historical modiﬁ cations Probably the most signiﬁ cant is the nineteenth 11 For a contemporary critical update on Kants vision of the uni versity see Lambert 2001 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory century von Humboldt model of the university as the place for training the highly selected and until recently exclusively male elites for leadership and intelligent citizenship That model is still prevalent in Europe In his stimulating and at times devastating anatomy of the contemporary university Bill Readings 1996 argues however that the institution has become posthistorical in that it has outlived itself is now a survivor of the era in which it deﬁ ned itself in terms of the project of the historical development afﬁ rmation and inculcation of national culture 1996 6 All the previous models of the university I men tioned above the Kantian the von Humboldt and even the British colonial defended by Cardinal Newman 1907 have been destabilized by the global economy In this respect the decline of the nationstate has negative consequences for the university as a whole and especially for the Humanities The central ﬁ gure in academic life today is not the professor argues Readings but the administrator and the university is no longer a pillar of national identity or an ideological arm of the nationstate and the state apparatus The university is now no more of a parasitical drain on resources than the stock exchange or the insurance company are a drain on industrial production Like the stock exchange the university is a point of capitals selfknowledge of capitals ability not just to manage risk or diversity but to extract a surplus value from that management In the case of the uni versity this extraction occurs as a result of speculation on differentials in information 1996 40 In this context the muchﬂ aunted notion of excellence means nothing substantial but is a crucial factor in the trans national exchange of academic capital A mere techno bureaucratic ideal Readings 1996 14 it has no content reference This dereferentialization of academic standards has both negative and positive consequences On the negative front the lack of speciﬁ c referents means that excellence is indexed on money markets demands and consumers satisfaction On a more positive note de referentialization opens up the possibility for new spaces in Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory differently 1996 124 What can we do with these models of university today Let us start by looking at the classical conservative model exempliﬁ ed by John Searle in his defence of the key ideas in the Western rationalist tradition 1995 as the core values of Humanities research Firmly grounded in a realist practice of truth the rationalist tradition is textbased and deploys theory in a selfcritical manner It rests on linear thinking because it assumes that the function of language is to com municate effectively Consequently truth is a matter of the accuracy of representation  according to a correspondence theory of truth which grounds statements in observable factual realities It follows that knowledge is expected to be objective  because it relies on representations of an indepen dently existing reality and not on subjectivist interpretations Rationality rules supreme and formal reason  as opposed to practical reason  has its own inner logic which provides standards of proof and validity As a result intellectual stan dards are nonnegotiable and grounded in objective criteria of excellence The traditional idea of the university is supposed to embody and uphold these criteria Searle opposes to this the post modernist university inﬂ uenced by imported antirealist theories of truth which weaken the scientiﬁ city of the aca demic practice The representativeness of the curriculum in terms of gender race and ethnicity  regrettably for Searle  becomes more important than its truth value introducing a shallow intellectual egalitarianism under the guise of mul ticulturalism This causes confusion between a domain to be studied and a cause to be defended which disrupts the deploy ment of traditional Humanities methods and practices and erodes its selfconﬁ dence In an eloquent response to Searle Richard Rorty 1996 criticizes the overemphasis on rationalism as a secularized version of the Western monotheistic tradition 1996 33 Realism and the correspondence to reality are rather mean ingless concepts or rather a term without content 1996 26 The muchpraised objectivity of science argues Rorty rests on active intersubjectivity and social interaction Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory Emphasizing the importance of sociopolitical factors in shaping meanings and truths Rorty strikes a more pragmatic note A healthy and free university accommodates generational change radical religious and political disagreement and new social responsibilities as best it can It muddles through 1996 28 The question of theory and the aftermath of the theory wars comes back to haunt this discussion Searles conservative remarks are accurate as the expression of his emotional involvement in the Humanities selfdefence He is nonethe less ruthless in blaming the postmodern theorists for the situ ation Contrary to the facile antipostmodernism of his approach I would stress the serious methodological chal lenges that this approach has thrown to the Humanities Indeed blaming the postmodern messengers for bringing the sobering message that the humanistic master narratives are in trouble is a sleight of hand that does not help further the cause of the Humanities today It is a great pity that the serious debate about the future of humanistic higher educa tion is caught up in the legacy of the 1990s theory wars and the polemical inﬁ ghting about feminism postmodernism multiculturalism and French philosophy Joan Scott puts it brilliantly As if postmodernists were the cause of all the problems of disciplinary uncertainty scholars are now facing as if their banishment would end the questions about difference posed by demographic changes in university populations by the emergence of postcolonial critiques of colonial assumptions by developments in the history of philosophy that reach back to at least the nineteenth century by the more recent end of the Cold War and by the extraordinary economic constraints of the last years Scott 1996 171 Referring back to John Deweys12 notion of the university as a disciplinary community Scott deplores the politicized 12 Dewey played an important role in launching the American Asso ciation of University Professors in 1915 Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory contests about postmodernism and knowledge which over emphasize the presumed political implications of ones scholarly ideas not the ideas themselves Louis Menand 1996 goes further and suggests that conservative political forces are manipulating theory wars as a pretext to interfere in the internal academic affairs of the university as evidence by the particularly targeted attacks against feminism multi culturalism and postcolonialism This critical insight is picked up by Edward Said who connects the identity crisis of the Humanities to the displacement of Eurocentric curri cula in US universities and adds quite ironically Some critics have reacted as if the very nature of the University and academic freedom had been threatened because unduly politicized Others have gone further for them the critique of the Western canon with its panoply of what its opponent have called Dead White European Males    has rather improbably signalled the outset of a new fascism the demise of Western civilization itself and the overturn of slavery child marriage bigamy and the harem Said 1996 21415 Irony left aside it is quite clear that the real target of the conservatives wrath is the threat that these new areas of studies pose to the power of corporate disciplines in two major ways through their radical epistemologies and their methodological interdisciplinarity The meltdown of disci plinary boundaries and the subsequent loss of corporate power by the old disciplines is less of a theoretical than an administrative crisis As Menand astutely observes given that the disciplines are not timeless entities but historically con tingent discursive formations their desegregation is not itself a source of anxiety for the scholars some of whom are even driving the process It is however a major headache for the administrators in charge of the machinery of selfgovernance of Humanities faculties who tend to take advantage of the state of ﬂ ux to reduce spending and increase forceful retrench ments 1996 19 But what does the posthuman have to do with any of this Instead of pursuing this polemic I would rather start from the empirical imperative to think global but act local to develop an institutional frame that actualized a posthuman Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory practice that is worthy of our times Braidotti 2011b while resisting the violence the injustice and the vulgarity of the times Confronting the historicity of our condition means moving the activity of thinking outwards into the real world so as to assume accountability for the conditions that deﬁ ne our location The epistemic and the ethical walk hand in hand into the complicated landscapes of the third millennium We need conceptual creativity and intellectual courage to rise to the occasion as there is no going back Although the issues of pastoral care and intergenerational justice are more topical than ever in the academic classroom it is also the case that since the Cold War era the function of the university has been mostly research and development for the sake of social development and industrial growth and technological advances including but not only the military as we saw in the previous chapter This is especially true of the USA but Europe and vast parts of Asia are also part of this model According to Wernick since the 1960s the uni versity has mutated into a multiversity fulﬁ lling a variety of social and economic functions often linked to the Cold War militarization of the social space and geopolitical con ﬂ icts The term multiversity was coined in 1963 by the then Chancellor of the University of California system Clark Kerr 2001 to refer to the explosion of tasks and demands imposed on major universities The university continued to mutate so that over the next twenty years universities have become corporate oriented to performance and detradition alized Under the aegis of professional managers they have become posthistorical institutions without a memory Wernick 2006 561 As the professoriate and students representative bodies lost their powers of governance to neo liberal economic logic the Humanities dispersed their foun dational value to become a sort of luxury intellectual consumer good Can this trend be reversed What is the most adequate model of the university for the globalized era I want to argue that the posthuman predicament affects also an issue as crucial as the civic responsibility of the university today How can the academic and civic space interact in our globalized technologically mediated world The digital revolution paves the way for at least a partial answer the new campuses will Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory be virtual and hence global by deﬁ nition This means that the universal ideal of transcendent values defended by Searle is over It is being rapidly replaced by the infrastructural vision of the university as a hub of both localized knowledge production and global transmission of cognitive data This need not necessarily result in either dehumanizing or dis embedding the university but in new forms of regrounding and of accountability Thus in an article pointedly called The twenty kilometer university an interdisciplinary team Phillips et al 2011 analyses the changing relationship between the university and the contemporary global city in China and draws some inspiring consequences for the mission of the academic institution today The global city space requires and depends upon intelligent spaces of hightechnological interactivity and can thus be deﬁ ned as a smart city space with dense technological infra structure Ambient technology rests on infrastructural net works which being nonhierarchical and userfriendly defeat the traditional organization of both knowledge production and knowledge transfer In some ways the technologically smart urban space displaces and replaces the university by inscribing knowledge and its circulation at the heart of the social order What happens then to the formerly segregated and at least in Europe highly sacralized academic space The authors argue that the academic needs to unfold onto the civic and become embedded in the urban environment in a radical new manner The city as a whole is the science park of the future The university consequently needs to transform itself into a multiversity Wernick 2006 561 capable of interacting with the city space so as to create a collective ethos of communal intelligence with a common goal of eco nomic progress through the means that sustain and stream line city life Phillips et al 2011 299 The branding of cities and their universities  which was initiated in the Cold War era  enters a new phase of intensifying marketing practices promotional efforts and a ﬁ nancial culture of private and public investments that are often unrelated to the actual content matter The global multiversity is the place where technology and metaphysics meet with explosive but also exhilarating consequences This globalized technologically mediated Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory multiversity is a new entity with its role in relation to citizenformation and bildung fading into the background if not outright obscurity Phillips et al 2011 300 Stefan Collini 2012 13 stresses the same point by arguing that we must stop thinking in terms of nineteenthcentury European ideals and focus instead on how it is the Asian incarnation of the Americanized version of the European model with schools of technology medicine and management to the fore which most powerfully instantiates the ideal of the university in the twentyﬁ rst century In other words the contemporary university needs to rede ﬁ ne its posthuman planetary mission in terms of a renewed relationship to the global city where it is situated This implies both a revision of the urban space and a redeﬁ nition of civic responsibility All the more so as according to the United Nations there will be 22 megacities in the world by 2015 and that by 2050 twothirds of the world population will dwell in urban centres In 2012 we ofﬁ cially registered the fact that 50 per cent of the world population now lives in cities More Internetbacked interactivity will allow citizens to participate in all forms of planning managing and assess ing their urban environment The key words are open source open governance open data and open science granting free access by the public to all scientiﬁ c and administrative data Contemporary twentyﬁ rstcentury cities as in the case of the Chinese study quoted above are not only sprawled out or exploded urban spaces They are also  in the best of cases  technologically mediated smart urban surfaces Just as in the past in Europe universities and their cities grew together weaving a complex web of urban social economic political and civic ties so today a new network of relations is being set up Because of the high degree of technological interven tion involved in contemporary network societies this new urban space can be considered as postanthropocentric and well beyond the Vitruvian frame of reference of a humanist scale Responding to local concerns and global challenges the contemporary multiversity faces up to both the demands of a competitive labour market global culture and the corporate world while pursuing its centuryold missions of scientiﬁ c excellence and enlightened citizenship The cities of tomor row will be living centres of learning information brokering Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory and shared cognitive practice based on intense social net working After naval ports and airports Internet ports will be the gateways to navigating the cities of the third millennium This takes me to the second aspect of the new covenant between the university and the city in the third millennium the civic dimension More than ever the university needs to pursue its aim of ensuring independent research constructive pedagogical practice and critical thinking Compounded by the role that contemporary universities can play as major technological hubs and global centres of knowledge transfer the mix of innovation and tradition can sustain the continu ing relevance of the institution of the university in the con temporary world The combination of technical skills and civic responsibility a concern for social and environmental sustainability and a discerning relationship to consumerism are the core values of the contemporary multiversity Bill Readings 1996 was hinting at this when he referred to the possibility that the contemporary university may help rede ﬁ ne community and belonging away from classical national ism on the one hand and crass consumerism on the other Referring to Blanchots work Readings call for a new model of the university as a community of postidentitarian posthu man subjects The model will be a community without steady identity or ﬁ xed unity for a people and a multiversity to come This has deep implications for the role and place of theory I remember the day when this speciﬁ c penny dropped inside my head I was at a Laurie Anderson concert in Paris in the late 1980s She is one of those conceptual artists who seam lessly unfold into a public intellectual creating acoustic and aesthetic expressions for the transformations of our times O Superman was the ﬁ rst cyber song to become a global hit  a premonition of posthuman things to come  whereas Strange Angels is a critical reappraisal of Walter Benjamins theses on the philosophy of History hinting at a new continuum between the remembrance of things past and the sustainabil ity of the future At this particular concert Anderson who would soon embark on her artist residency with NASA deﬁ ned the work of people who used to call themselves intel lectuals as having become contentproviders That was the Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory late 1980s Last week I received the announcement of a major conference on the future of European education in which an entire panel was devoted to papers by and about ideas brokers That entails marketing and advertising ideas rather than fundamental research and experimentation it does not even particularly require imaginative creativity Academics are left to brokering ideas while information networks do the content provision and are increasingly autonomous in decision making All around an exploded and expanded smart city space distributes the knowledge products to stu dentsusers who are literate in infrastructural knowledge pro duction Welcome to the future That future has already started in the endless reorganiza tions and ﬁ nancial restrictions that plague the contemporary academic world and are particularly acute in the Humanities Louis Menand argues that the modern research university is neither the embodiment of eternal truths and universal ideas nor the paragon of truth beauty and virtue It is actually a rather cumbersome and expensive bureaucracy It is philosophically weak and it encourages intellectual pre dictability professional insularity and social irrelevance It deserves to be replaced But if it is replaced it is in the interests of everyone who values the continued integrity of teaching and inquiry to devise a new institutional structure that will perform the same function Otherwise academic freedom will be killed by the thing that in America kills most swiftly and surely not bad ideas but lack of money Menand 1996 19 This negative social and economic context of ﬁ nancial scarcity has caused a distinct deterioration of the working conditions of all staff in the average neoliberal university worldwide Stefan Collini comments on this issue with cus tomary wit The distracted numbersswamped auditcrazed grantchasing life of most contemporary academics depart ments is far removed from classical ideals of the contempla tive life Collini 2012 19 As a matter of fact academics function more like midranking executives in a business orga nization run by accountants and ﬁ nancial advisors than as independent scholars in a selforganized community The more successful ones have become very skilful in obtaining external grants and funding They are also known as the Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory tenderpreneurs Rosalind Gill 2010 on the other hand not only deplores the working conditions in the academic world but also attempts to assess the damage they cause to both individuals and the institutions where stress and com petitiveness rule The precariousness of younger staff members is a source of special concern Collini concurs the conditions of work of junior and temporary staff in some unfavoured institutions may in limiting cases suggest comparisons with those of staff in a call center 2012 19 Yet it does feel slightly incongruous to think about all this from my speciﬁ c location in the ancient city of Utrecht in the heart of the old world City and university here have become so interwoven over the span of centuries that it is difﬁ cult to tell the urban civic structure apart from the aca demic one Civitas and Universitas are two sides of the same coin and it may not be simple to shift the grounds of their interaction in the name of the posthuman predicament What might the blueprint for the future look like I want to resist the apocalyptic visions of the last professors as a dying species Donoghue 2008 Posthuman Humanities marked by a new alliance between the arts and the sciences and enriched by the ancient European academic and civic tradition can sponsor multiple allegiances and new ecologies of belonging They can redeﬁ ne cosmopolitanism fulﬁ lling the posthuman deﬁ nition of Europe as the place that is historically and morally bound to the critical reelaboration of its own history By extension we need a university that looks like the society it both reﬂ ects and serves that is to say a globalized techno logically mediated ethnically and linguistically diverse society that is still in tune with basic principles of social justice the respect for diversity the principles of hospitality and convivial ity I am aware but do not mind the residual Humanism of such aspirations which I take at best as a productive contradic tion Against the social construction of wilful forgetfulness and of crass ignorance I defend a fundamental aspiration to over arching principles of posthuman bonding A university that is seriously committed to representing todays world needs to tackle these issues by instituting transdisciplinary areas which explore the production of knowledge in a technologi cally mediated world the new relationship between arts and sciences and the polylingual realities engendered by global Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory ization In a new outpour of intellectual creativity posthu man Humanities in the global multiversity will include Humanistic Informatics or digital Humanities Cognitive or neural humanities Environmental or sustainable Humanities Biogenetic and Global Humanities They will also pursue the project of investigating what kind of research methods and insights are developed by literary and art practices They will continue to support the human minds restless pursuit of fuller understanding Collini 2012 27 which is the essential mission of the Humanities In other words I think the Humanities can and will survive and prosper to the extent that they will show the ability and willingness to undergo a major process of transformation in the direction of the posthuman To be worthy of our times we need to be pragmatic we need schemes of thought and ﬁ gurations that enable us to account in empowering terms for the changes and transformations currently on the way We already live in permanent states of transition hybridiza tion and nomadic mobility in emancipated postfeminist multiethnic societies with high degrees of technological inter vention These are neither simple nor linear events but rather multilayered and internally contradictory phenomena They combine elements of ultramodernity with splinters of neoarchaism hightech advances and neoprimitivism which defy the logic of the excluded middle Contemporary culture and institutional education are often unable to represent these realities adequately They favour instead the predictably plaintive refrains about the end of ideologies run concurrently with the apology of the new Nostalgia and hyperconsumerism join hands under the hold of neoliberal restoration of possessive individualism This unitary vision of the humanist subject however cannot provide an effective antidote to the processes of fragmenta tion ﬂ ows and mutations that mark our era We need to start from nonunitary relational subject positions so as to learn to think differently about ourselves and our systems of values starting with adequate cartographies of our embedded and embodied posthuman locations A university that looks like the world of today can only be a multiversity is an exploded and expanded institution that will afﬁ rm a constructive posthumanity As such it cannot Posthuman Humanities Life beyond Theory labour market but also for its own sake We do need to embrace nonproﬁ t as a key value in contemporary knowledge production but this gratuitousness is linked to the construction of social horizons of hope and therefore it is a vote of conﬁ  dence in the sheer sustainability of the future Braidotti 2006 The future is nothing more or less than intergenerational soli darity responsibility for posterity but it is also our shared dream or a consensual hallucination13 Collini puts it beauti fully 2012 199 we are merely custodians for the present generation of a complex intellectual inheritance which we did not create and which is not ours to destroy Posthuman Humanities are already at work in the global multiversity not only to fend off extinction but also to actualize sustainable posthuman futures 13 This is William Gibsons deﬁ nition of cyberspace Conclusion Not all of us can say with even a modicum of certainty that we have actually become posthuman or that we are only that Some of us insist on feeling quite attached to the human that creature familiar from time immemorial who as a species a planetary presence and a cultural formation spells out speciﬁ c modes of belonging Nor could we explain with any degree of accuracy by which historical contingency intel lectual vicissitudes or twists of fate we have entered the posthuman universe And yet the idea of the posthuman by now enjoys widespread currency in the era known as the anthropocene It elicits elation in equal measure to anxiety and it stimulates controversial cultural representations More importantly for the purposes of this book the posthuman predicament enforces the necessity to think again and to think harder about the status of the human the importance of recasting subjectivity accordingly and the need to invent forms of ethical relations norms and values worthy of the complexity of our times This calls also for the redeﬁ nition of the aims and structures of critical thought and it ultimately comes to bear on the institutional status of the academic ﬁ eld of the Humanities in the contemporary university This book opened with four vignettes that illustrate the excitement as well as the horrors of our times the undoing of the natureculture divide and the high degrees of techno Conclusion logical mediation that create a series of paradoxes such as an electronically linked panhumanity which also breeds intolerance and even xenophobic violence Genetically recom bined plants animals and vegetables proliferate alongside computer and other viruses while unmanned ﬂ ying and ground armed vehicles confront us with new ways of dying Humanity is recreated as a negative category held together by shared vulnerability and the spectre of extinction but also struck down by new and old epidemics in endless new wars detention camps and refugee exodus The appeals for new forms of cosmopolitan relations or a global ethos are often answered by the homicidal acts of the likes of Pekka Eric Auvinen or Anders Behring Breivik1 This book has attempted to analyse in successive waves the alternation of fascination for the posthuman condition and the concern for its inhuman and even inhumane aspects All along I have emphasized the importance of critical theory in the sense of a mix of critique and creativity that makes it imperative for us to come to terms with the present in new fundamental ways My main concerns are how to ﬁ nd ade quate theoretical and imaginary representations for our lived conditions and how to experiment together with alternative forms of posthuman subjectivity The four key questions I set out at the beginning have structured this book as a journey across the multifaceted landscape of the posthuman how can we account for the intellectual and historical itineraries that may have led us to the posthuman Secondly where does the posthuman condition leave humanity and more speciﬁ  cally what new forms of subjectivity does it engender Thirdly how can we stop the posthuman from becoming inhumane And last what is the function of the Humanities and of theory in posthuman times These questions are not linear but intertwined and they trace a zigzagging route across a complex landscape I adopted the speaking stance and the writing position of a tracker and a cartographer in order to account not only for the difﬁ cult transitions but also confessed perpetrator of the 2011 attacks in Oslo and on the island of Utoya killing respectively eight and sixtynine people mostly Socialist youth for some of the contradictions inherent in our current pre dicament Let us see how far we have come at the end of this journey Posthuman Subjectivity The posthuman subject is not postmodern because it does not rely on any antifoundationalist premises Nor is it post structuralist because it does not function within the linguistic turn or other forms of deconstruction Not being framed by the ineluctable powers of signiﬁ cation it is consequently not condemned to seek adequate representation of its existence within a system that is constitutionally incapable of granting due recognition Being based on Lack and Law the linguistic signiﬁ er can at best distribute entrapment and withhold empowerment Its sovereign power builds on the negative passions it solicits making hungry where it most satisﬁ es through envy castration and by encouraging addictive pat terns of consumption of material discursive and cultural goods The posthuman nomadic subject is materialist and vitalist embodied and embedded  it is ﬁ rmly located somewhere according to the radical immanence of the politics of loca tion that I have stressed throughout this book It is a multi faceted and relational subject conceptualized within a monistic ontology through the lenses of Spinoza Deleuze and Guattari plus feminist and postcolonial theories It is a subject actualized by the relational vitality and elemental complexity that mark posthuman thought itself Vital politics breaks clearly from the notion made canoni cal by poststructuralism and psychoanalysis of the primacy of culture and of signiﬁ cation over subject formation There is no originary and fatal capture of an allegedly unmarked subject by the matrix of power be it the Phallus the Logos Eurocentric transcendental reason or heterosexual normativ ity Power is not a steady location operated by a single mas terful owner Monistic politics places differential mechanisms of distribution of power effects at the core of subjectivity Multiple mechanisms of capture also engender multiple forms of resistance Power formations are timebound and conse Conclusion interaction Movement and speed lines of sedimentation and lines of ﬂ ight are the main factors that affect the formation of a nonunitary posthuman subject The nomadic vision of subjectivity is a good starting point but we need to push it further connecting it to two other crucial ideas desire as plenitude and posthuman ethics The idea of desire as plenitude and not as lack produces a more transformative and less negative approach to the nomadic relational subject than previously allowed for instance by the split subject of psychoanalysis The nomadic subject is a branch of complexity theory and it promotes a continuing emphasis on the radical ethics of transformation This is not to deny the role that historical contingency and cultural codes play in subject formation but rather to subject these very factors to a serious update in the light of their own changing structures and compositions As Deleuze and Guattari argue in their critique of psychoanalysis 1977 Jacques Lacans notion of the symbolic is as outdated as a Polaroid shot of a world that has since moved on It captures a frozen frame of family and other intersubjective relations at a time in history when advanced capitalism is investing them with a thoroughly subversive spin The biopolitical nature of this system has grown exponentially since the 1970s affecting radical new forms of intersubjective relationality To state the contrary would be to embrace psychological essentialism and condemn our psychic life to step outside of history and social transformations Our psyche  with its affective fantasy ridden desiredriven complications  would then be forever static in an unhistorical limbo framed by the selfreplicating power of a despotic master signiﬁ er For all vitalist matter realists this mournful vision of a subject desperately attached to the conditions of its own impotence is quite simply an inadequate representation of what we are in the process of becoming We need to be worthy of the present and thus be part of contemporary culture embodying and embedding the subject of this particular world Far from being a ﬂ ight from the real posthuman thought inscribes the contemporary subject in the conditions of its own historicity Life by the same token is neither a metaphysical notion nor a semiotic system of meaning it expresses itself in a multiplicity of empirical acts there is nothing to say but everything to do Life simply by being life expresses itself by actualizing ﬂ ows of energies through codes of vital infor mation across complex somatic cultural and technologically networked systems This is why I defend the idea of amor fati as a way of accepting vital processes and the expressive inten sity of a Life we share with multiple others here and now Posthuman Ethics We are becoming posthuman ethical subjects in our multiple capacities for relations of all sorts and modes of communica tion by codes that transcend the linguistic sign by exceeding it in many directions At this particular point in our collective history we simply do not know what our enﬂ eshed selves minds and bodies as one can actually do We need to ﬁ nd out by embracing an ethics of experiment with intensities The ethical imagination is alive and well in posthuman sub jects in the form of ontological relationality A sustainable ethics for nonunitary subjects rests on an enlarged sense of interconnection between self and others including the non human or earth others by removing the obstacle of self centred individualism on the one hand and the barriers of negativity on the other In other words to be posthuman does not mean to be indifferent to the humans or to be dehumanized On the contrary it rather implies a new way of combining ethical values with the wellbeing of an enlarged sense of community which includes ones territorial or environmental intercon nections This is an ethical bond of an altogether different sort from the selfinterests of an individual subject as deﬁ ned along the canonical lines of classical humanism or from the moral universalism of the Kantians and their reliance on extending human rights to all species virtual entities and cellular compositions Nussbaum 2006 Posthuman theory also bases the ethical relation on positive grounds of joint projects and activities not on the negative or reactive grounds of shared vulnerability This processoriented vision of the subject is capable of a universalistic reach though it rejects moral and cognitive Conclusion universalism It expresses a grounded partial form of account ability based on a strong sense of collectivity and relational ity which results in a renewed claim to community and belonging by singular subjects Lloyd refers to these locally situated microuniversalist claims as a collaborative moral ity Lloyd 1996 74 The stated criteria for this new ethics include nonproﬁ t emphasis on the collective acceptance of relationality and of viral contaminations concerted efforts at experimenting with and actualizing potential or virtual options and a new link between theory and practice includ ing a central role for creativity They are not moral injunc tions but dynamic frames for an ongoing experiment with intensities They need to be enacted collectively so as to produce effective cartographies of how much bodies can take which is why I also call them thresholds of sustainability Braidotti 2006 They aim to create collective bonds a new affective community or polity The key notion in posthuman nomadic ethics is the tran scendence of negativity What this means concretely is that the conditions for renewed political and ethical agency cannot be drawn from the immediate context or the current state of the terrain They have to be generated afﬁ rmatively and cre atively by efforts geared to creating possible futures by mobi lizing resources and visions that have been left untapped and by actualizing them in daily practices of interconnection with others This project requires more visionary power or pro phetic energy qualities which are neither especially in fashion in academic circles nor highly valued scientiﬁ cally in these times of coercive pursuit of globalized excellence Yet the call for more vision is emerging from many quarters in critical theory Feminists have a long and rich genealogy in terms of pleading for increased visionary insight From the very early days Joan Kelly 1979 typiﬁ ed feminist theory as a double edged vision with a strong critical and an equally strong creative function That creative dimension has been central ever since Haraway 1997 2003 Rich 2001 and it consti tutes the afﬁ rmative and innovative core of the radical epis temologies of feminism gender race and postcolonial studies Faith in the creative powers of the imagination is an integral part of feminists appraisal of lived embodied experience and the bodily roots of subjectivity which would express the become Conceptual creativity is simply unimaginable without some visionary fuel Prophetic or visionary minds are thinkers of the future The future as an active object of desire propels us forth and motivates us to be active in the here and now of a continuous present that calls for both resistance and the counteractual ization of alternatives The yearning for sustainable futures can construct a liveable present This is not a leap of faith but an active transposition a transformation at the indepth level Braidotti 2006 A prophetic or visionary dimension is necessary in order to secure an afﬁ rmative hold over the present as the launching pad for sustainable becoming or qualitative transformations of the negativity and the injus tices of the present The future is the virtual unfolding of the afﬁ rmative aspect of the present which honours our obliga tions to the generations to come Afﬁ rmative Politics The pursuit of collective projects aimed at the afﬁ rmation of hope rooted in the ordinary micropractices of everyday life is a strategy to set up sustain and map out sustainable trans formations The motivation for the social construction of hope is grounded in a sense of responsibility and intergener ational accountability A fundamental gratuitousness and a sense of hope is part of it Hope is a way of dreaming up possible futures an anticipatory virtue that permeates our lives and activates them It is a powerful motivating force grounded not only in projects that aim at reconstructing the social imaginary but also in the political economy of desires affects and creativity that underscore it Contemporary practices of posthuman subjectivity work towards a more afﬁ rmative approach to critical theory Beyond unitary visions of the self and teleological renditions of the processes of subject formation posthuman thought can sustain the contemporary subjects in the efforts to synchro nize themselves with the changing world in which they try to make a positive difference For instance against the estab lished tradition of methodological nationalism a different Conclusion image of thought can be activated that rejects Eurouniver salism and trusts instead in the powers of planetary diversity We also need to enlist affectivity memory and the imagina tion to the crucial task of inventing new ﬁ gurations and new ways of representing the complex subjects we have become Science itself is socially inscribed and ecologically integrated not along the nationalistic axis but in a nomadic web of posthuman earthwide connections Becomingposthuman consequently is a process of redeﬁ n ing ones sense of attachment and connection to a shared world a territorial space urban social psychic ecological planetary as it may be It expresses multiple ecologies of belonging while it enacts the transformation of ones senso rial and perceptual coordinates in order to acknowledge the collective nature and outwardbound direction of what we still call the self This is in fact a moveable assemblage within a common lifespace that the subject never masters nor possesses but merely inhabits crosses always in a commu nity a pack a group or a cluster For posthuman theory the subject is a transversal entity fully immersed in and imma nent to a network of nonhuman animal vegetable viral relations The zoecentred embodied subject is shot through with relational linkages of the contaminatingviral kind which interconnect it to a variety of others starting from the envi ronmental or ecoothers and include the technological apparatus This nonessentialist brand of vitalism reduces the hubris of rational consciousness which far from being an act of vertical transcendence is rather recast and pushed down wards in a grounding exercise of radical immanence It is an act of unfolding the self onto the world while enfolding the world within What if consciousness were in fact just another cognitive mode of relating to ones own environment and to others What if by comparison with the immanent know how of animals conscious selfrepresentation were blighted by narcissistic delusions of transcendence and consequently blinded by its own aspirations to selftransparency What if consciousness were ultimately incapable of ﬁ nding a remedy to its obscure disease this life this zoe an impersonal force that moves us without asking for our permission to do so Zoe is an inhuman force that stretches beyond life to new vitalist ways of approaching death as an impersonal event The process ontology centred on life leads the posthuman subject to confront this position lucidly without making con cessions to either moral panic or melancholia It asserts a secular ethical drive to enter into modes of relation that enhance and sustain ones ability to renew and expand the boundaries of what transversal and nonunitary subjects can become The ethical ideal is to actualize the cognitive affec tive and sensorial means to cultivate higher degrees of empow erment and afﬁ rmation of ones interconnections to others in their multiplicity The selection of the affective forces that propel the process of becoming posthuman is regulated by an ethics of joy and afﬁ rmation that functions through the trans formation of negative into positive passions Very much a philosophy of the outside of open spaces and embodied enactments nomadic posthuman thought yearns for a qualitative leap out of the familiar trusting the untapped possibilities opened by our historical location in the techno logically mediated world of today It is a way of being worthy of our times to increase our freedom and understanding of the complexities we inhabit in a world that is neither anthro pocentric nor anthropomorphic but rather geopolitical eco sophical and proudly zoecentred Posthuman all too Human I stated in the introduction that how one feels about the posthuman depends to a great extent on how one relates to the human in the ﬁ rst place I have honestly stated my anti humanist propensities throughout this book my interest in the posthuman is directly proportional to the sense of frustra tion I feel about the human all too human resources and limi tations that frame our collective and personal intensity There is anticipation as well as impatience in what I have been trying to write about in this book Undeniably the vitalist egalitari anism of zoe is likely to attract those who have become dis enchanted with and disengaged from the anthropocentrism that is built into humanistic thought even in what is left of the political Left of feminism and postcolonial theory I live at the tail end of biopower that is to say amidst the relentless necropolitical consumption of all that lives I am committed Conclusion to starting from this not from a nostalgic reinvention of an allinclusive transcendental model a romanticized margin or some holistic ideal I want to think from here and now from Dolly my sister and oncomouse as my totemic divinity from missing seeds and dying species But also simultaneously and without contradiction from the staggering unexpected and relentlessly generative ways in which life as bios and as zoe keeps on ﬁ ghting back This is the kind of materialism that makes me a posthuman thinker at heart and a joyful member of multiple companion species in practice Haraway 2003 I have no nostalgia for that Man alleged measure of all things human or for the forms of knowledge and selfrepresentation he engineered I welcome the multiple horizons that have opened up since the historical downfall of androcentric and Eurocentric Humanism I see the posthuman turn as an amazing opportunity to decide together what and who we are capable of becoming and a unique opportunity for humanity to re invent itself afﬁ rmatively through creativity and empowering ethical relations and not only negatively through vulnerability and fear It is a chance to identify opportunities for resistance and empowerment on a planetary scale I am putting the ﬁ nishing touches to this manuscript just as the 2012 London Olympics are in full swing One of the sensations of these games is the performance by the Jamaican athlete Usain Bolt who ran the mens 100 metre race in 963 seconds at an average speed of 38 kmh the 200 mens metre race in 1932 seconds and with his team mates the 4  100 metre relay race in a breathtaking world record of 3684 seconds The speed is such as to defy our powers of compre hension and it has ignited the imagination of the globally connected world Although this extraordinary runner is expected to improve his personal best record by a couple of seconds more it is generally acknowledged that Usain Bolts superhuman performance has stretched the boundaries of what the human body is capable of achieving at the present point in time Whether this boundary turns out to be an insurmountable physiological limit a collectively selfimposed limitation or rather the threshold of potential exploits by new bodies to come remains to be seen At the same Olympic Games the South African athlete Oscar Pistorius made history as the ﬁ rst double amputee to compete Although the struggle to qualify was long and con troversial and the athlete did not win any medals in the end Pistorius was the ﬁ rst enhanced human to run on carbon ﬁ bre transtibial artiﬁ cial limbs2 and hold his ground valiantly against natural born fastidious bipeds The extent to which Pistorius otherwise human performance sets the tone for posthuman things to come is now an open question Whether the precedent he set has a future and what kind of scenarios it might enable remain to be seen Faced with transformations of this magnitude it is urgent to set a new posthuman social agenda The limits and limita tions of posthuman bodies must become the object of collec tive discussions and decisions across the multiple constituencies of our polity and civil society in a manner that does not assume the centrality let alone the universality of humanistic principles and anthropocentric assumptions We now need to learn to think differently about ourselves and to experiment with new fundamental schemes of thought about what counts as the new basic unit of common reference for the human This is why I insisted so much in this book on issues of sub jectivity we need new frameworks for the identiﬁ cation of common points of reference and values in order to come to terms with the staggering transformations we are witnessing This book rests on the ﬁ rm belief that we early third millen nium posthuman subjects in our multiple and differential locations are perfectly capable of rising to the challenge of our times provided we make it into a collective endeavour and joint project Concrete actualized praxis is the best way to deal with the virtual possibilities that are opening up under our very eyes as a result of our collectively sustained social and scientiﬁ c advances Human embodiment and subjectivity are currently under going a profound mutation Like all people living in an age of transition we are not always lucid or clear about where we are going or even capable of explaining what exactly is happening to and around us Some of these events strike us in awe and fear while others startle us with delight It is as if our current context kept on throwing open the doors of our collective perception forcing us to hear the roar of cosmic energy that lies on the other side of silence and to stretch the 2 They are Cheetah FlexFoot devices by the ﬁ rm Ossur Conclusion measure of what has become possible It is both exciting and unsettling to be reminded almost on a daily basis that we are after all such stuff as dreams are made of and that the new possibilities are immense No wonder so many of us turn their backs on this preferring to go about well wadded with stupidity as George Eliot prophetically put it And yet Dolly the sheep is real not a science ﬁ ction char acter but the result of our scientiﬁ c research an active social imaginary and major ﬁ nancial investments Although he is popularly known as Blade Runner Oscar Pistorius does not dream of electric sheep Conductorfree trains connecting global transportation hubs to major metropolitan centres are by now a familiar sight and our handheld electronic devices so powerful that we can barely keep up with them Human all too posthuman these extensions and enhancements of what bodies can do are here to stay Are we going to be able to catch up with our posthuman selves or shall we continue to linger in a theoretical and imaginative state of jetlag in relation to our lived environment This is not Huxleys Brave New World that is to say a dystopian rendition of the worst modernist nightmares Nor is it a transhumanist delirium of transcendence from the corporeal frame of the contemporary human This is a new situation we ﬁ nd ourselves in the immanent here and now of a posthuman planet It is one of the possible worlds we have made for ourselves and in so far as it is the result of our joint efforts and collective imaginings it is quite simply the best of all possible posthuman worlds Bhabha Homi K 1994 The Location of Culture London and New York Routledge Bhabha Homi K 1996a Unpacking my library    again In Iain Chambers and Lidia

    ns1:text "Chapter 3 Posthuman Sexuality From Ahumanity to Cosmogenic Desire lenge conﬁgurations of life However there are ways in which an ethics of posthu man sexuality coming from a feminist history can be both accountable and avoid the perils of superﬁcial posthumanism via certain instances of desire This chapter will explore the trajectory of posthuman desire implemented through Continental Philosophy and end with a variety of conﬁgurations of desire beyond humanism but also beyond the phallologically driven biotech fetishism of some posthuman ism The posthuman shows we can no longer be trustworthy of studies of the human of humanism or even of the dispelling of the myth we were ever human Posthuman sexuality in its primary repudiation of the objectsubject sexual dialo gue reconstitutes desire not as between two or subject and thing but as affective and thus ethical force desire is constituted before the crystallization of the body and the organs before the division of the sexes before the separation between the familiarized self and the social ﬁeld Guattari 1996 153 Similar to Guattaris claim that desire belongs to the before and beyond of the subject Kristevas semio tic emphasises the before and the beyond the symbolic which is where feminist desire is found but never revealed Kristeva argues that asigniﬁed drive and thus asignifying image is not infantile prehuman but schizoid posthuman destructuring and asignifying machine of the unconscious  schizophrenic ﬂow  not schizophrenic blockage is a structuring and destructuring practice a passage to the

Companion to the Posthumanities httpsdoiorg1010079783319621401_3 it be jouissance and revolution 1984 17 The posthuman in its rupturing of causal and chronocentric evolution including desire as evolutionarily more reﬁned is outside of time into a place of encounter with the imperceptible but materially affective outside Perhaps also this is why my position as a feminist of posthuman sexualities will be guilty of what Cary Wolfe states of That paradoxical observa bility of the unobservable the communicability of the incommunicable  which ought to sound familiar to students of romanticism 2009 xxxii Seemingly Foucault is similarly romantic A manifest truth writes Foucault disappearing not when it is replaced by another one that is fresher or sharper but when one begins to detect the very conditions that made it seem manifest the familiarities that served as its support the darknesses that bought about its clarity and all those far away things that secretly sustained it and made it go without saying 1994 447 Foucaults claim balances the wonder of the Romantic imperceptible embracing Outside with the required acknowledgement that the way reality is constituted and by whom is a ﬂawed result of regimes of power and masquerades of observa ble exteriority This directly correlates with the way woman has fallen Outside both phallocentric discourse and also navigates the desire to be Outside without being silenced or locked there by patriarchal forces Wolfes posthumanities via sexualities and animalities tends toward Jacques Derrida Judith Butler Bruno Latour and what could be argued a more American theoretical framework which privileges performativity in reference to sexuality and fetishisation in reference to animality Wolfe in his discussion of the place of ethics in posthuman theory explores the status of biotechnology another cyberfetish site for posthuman becomings Many other posthuman theorists tend toward Levinas Derrida Latour Haraway and Hayles while interestingly those theorists who are more aligned with my framework such as Rosi Braidotti Anna HickeyMoody Elizabeth Grosz Claire Colebrook and Felicity Colman seem to shy away from posthuman theory or are more critical of it emphasizing French feminism and the Nietzschian Bergsonian Spinozist Kristevan Irigarayan and DeleuzioGuattarian line This is the trajectory of posthuman feminism via which my understanding of posthuman sexuality emerges In a claim which both dispels all sexuality and by doing so opens up desire as an inﬁnite everything Foucault states it is not sufﬁcient to liberate sexuality it is also necessary to liberate ourselves from the notion of sexuality itself 2000 245 According to Braidotti 2013 98100 the key determining feature of post human sexualities comes from the shift from isomorphic binarism where the world and concepts are bifurcated into seeming oppositional categories which con ceal the dominance of one term perpetuated over the failure of the other term to achieve equivalence to rhizomatic connectivities Benhabib takes three elements of postmodern thought roughly translatable into posthumanism as problematic when formulating a feminist ethics for selfhood which resonate with posthuman philosophies within an explicitly feminist context due to their address to the most emphatic of all isomorphic dominant terms man These are the death of the sub ject what she calls The Death of Man the excavation of the truth of history or P MacCormack The Death of History and the death of the desire to master the self and the world by knowing everything The Death of Metaphysics 1992 211 Pepperell reﬂects on what could be called an additional death belonging to the Posthuman Condition the death of the discrete episteme in posthumanism where science meets philosophy He sees three key questions central to both science and philoso phy become defunct within the posthuman condition 1 That there will be an answer 2 That if there were an answer it would be satisfactory 3 That if the answer were satisfactory it would be because it provided a ﬁnal cause for human existence This ﬁnal cause would not be open to any further analysis of the kind that might ask what is the cause of the ﬁnal cause of human existence 1997 29 original emphasis Two major elements are responsible for or result from the death of the subject These are the ﬁguration of an embodied corporeal self as opposed to the transcendental or metaphysical and the need for different types of subject always housed in different types of bodies to become viable and ethically considered in culture particularly phallologocentric white capitalist culture This according to Guattari would be the machinic connectivity inherent in posthuman ity which replaces the diachronous ﬁnite couplings of oppositional binarised and asymmetrically empowered traits A machinics breaking with capitalist modes of thought would imply a refusal of the dichotomy between material processes and semiotic processes It would be brought to consider the deterritorializations of time and space only in connection with a new type of assemblage of enunciation new types of faciality traits refrains relations to the body sex the cosmos Guattari 2011 105 The idea of subjectivity is vast in philosophy yet constitutes any referent to ones sexuality as subjectivity in opposition or identical constitutes sexuality and even queer grapples with object and self as acting constituents but its ability to cross epistemes and indeed be the major focus of almost every question asked in every ﬁeld namely who or what am I psychically in psychoanalysis biologically in science and medicine metaphysically in philosophy elucidates the importance of being a subject in order to know what kind of subject one is Crucially however sex and sexuality distribute themselves within each of these epistemes so clearly haunt transgress and challenge all knowledges in their capa city to emerge as the thought of the body  that is the ﬂows and intensities from Outside by which bodies coalesce but which are not discrete and operational in any logical or demarcated manner Many feminists especially those who are sus picious of the representation or lack thereof of women in philosophy and the turn to the hyper technologised male of posthuman fetishism point to the redun dancy of the question who or what am I when it comes to women What does the death of subjectivity mean in postmodernism for those who never really had a selfdeﬁned subject to begin with For many feminists the question should have been acknowledged before posthumanism took ﬂight and made us all dissipative molecular constellations Many anxieties follow this question such as whether the death of subjectivity by male theorists is an appropriation of any subversive poten tial women had by being not fully ingrained by that idea of something to lose or whether the death of subjectivity means the wiping over of any history of Posthuman Sexuality From Ahumanity to Cosmogenic Desire oppression women may want to remember speciﬁcally due to their being women an anxiety Benhabib explicitly addresses in her argument on the death of the subject For in calling the death of subjectivity The Death of Man Benhabib points out that only man or male subjectivity has anything to lose through postmodern ism Mans desire was so exhaustively catalogued while womens was yetto come an arrival that in a liberating way happily never occurred By situating the postmodern postsubject posthuman within the two primary locations of corpore ality and difference postmodernism is giving women what they have always and already been condemned to  entrapment within their own ﬂesh that precedes any concept of self and is spoken for and about by others and a terminal othering from normalised axes of acceptability The desire of postmodern subjectivity in many ways is a desire to BecomeWoman Ironically and as Haraway tells us cyborgs always speak ironically 1990 149 Lacans perpetual question of what do women want coming from his anxieties over how they can be deﬁned in order that he may be deﬁned returns in posthumanities in the paradigmatic shift from the question who is the subject for feminists that never was for posthumanities that no longer is to how does the subject desire For here is found a profound alteration in concerns both for feminists and posthumanities  to deﬁne the subject is a humanist project to understand the subject as an expressive and affected con duit in perpetual relations with other expressive and affected entities via desire is the foundation of corporeal feminist posthumanities see eg MacCormack 2009 One of the most promising and contentious critiqued and celebrated elements of projects of becoming is becomingwoman It represents the pinnacle of Benhabibs anxieties about the death of subjectivity where the death of man has the potential to be the appropriation of woman by men Such a strategy enhances the subversive qualities of being oppressed and disdainful to dominant desirable male subjectivity without being accountable for this oppression or aware of the realities of living in a perhaps subversive but more pertinently often painful marginalised and most remarkably malegiven malearticulated body In a cynical explication I could suggest the desire to enter into a becomingwoman remains sufﬁciently within a binarised subjectobject dialectic but at least sees the oppressed term not as an object for consumption objectiﬁcation or domination but as an intensity or threshold which offers opportunities for escape from phallo logocentrism This problematic locus is where much of the arguments between trans subjects who wish to retain an operational binarised understanding of gender and socalled radical feminists occur But the important term seems to be increas ingly from a posthuman context at least less about women and more about desiring becoming The sexuality which is not desire for an objectterm but desire for metamorphosis itself is more valuable than the mythologised phantasy of the term woman And at least women are tactically human enough to respond albeit via minor language and thus are not coopted in the revolting manner much posthumanism perpetrates on nonhuman animals through assimilations of thor oughly human apprehensions of nonhuman behaviour and systems From ﬁghting for equality safety in our bodies and the ability to articulate our own selves the idea that our bodies are now fashionable theoretically and ripe for assimilation by P MacCormack the logic that marginalises us in the ﬁrst place is the current trend in posthuman theory Any desire to transform subjectivity potentially fails to address these pro blems because of the speaking position the thought presumes no longer exists may still exist or be important hence posthuman which when espoused by male theorists potentially believes female is a position no longer implicit and hence no longer pertinent The importance of maintaining an address to becoming woman despite its numerous valid criticism is twofold First where does the speciﬁcity of a lived womans body and history go when the desire to become process nonﬁxity and becoming replaces the idea of an historical embodied self This may help us reintroduce political materialism to posthuman experimentation Second does the creation of a constantly altering transforming self relinquish con cepts of accountability ethical responsibility and include responsibility for history My response to these questions is thus The activity of locating and transforming through others within the self produces an active engagement with 1 Concepts of other not limited by and not entirely deposing of the borders of the ﬂesh an embodied self which actively desires others as molecular not molar either the other in the self or other bodies which themselves have their own boundless others such that all speciﬁcities of all concrete others are actively engaged with at every moment a self which identiﬁes the borders of the ﬂesh and its histories but does not see them as indicative of wholes or organisms for the future due to such borders This is an ethical Spinozist map ping of the desiring body 2 Concepts which deconstruct sometimes violently any notion of the sanctity and integrity of a subject created to resemble a valuable capital commodity be it overvalued male subjectivity or objectiﬁed female biology This repudiates all oppositional sexual dialectics 3 The nature of what is being deconstructed so that history and accountability are always in process with transformation  we can transform to something else but we transform from whenever we transform to We may all be queer now but we do not forget what certain constitutions of sexuality did to minoritarians In another ironic turn then posthuman women are like Monique Wittigs les bians 1992 13 not actually women because they are delivered from an opposi tional structure Deleuze and Guattari point to the molar woman the little girl robbed of her own bodys potential who could have become woman molecularly piecebypiece with indeterminate speciﬁcities Through phallologocentric interven tion regulation or as Grosz calls it cultures most intensiﬁed disinvestments and recastings of the body 1994 174175 this little girl ceased becoming and is now being as stagnant as molarwoman Woman according to Deleuze and Guattari is deﬁned by a relation of movement and rest speed and slowness by a combination of atoms an emission of particles haeccity She never ceases to roam upon a body without organs She is an abstract line or a line of ﬂight Thus girls do not belong to an age group sex order or kingdom they slip in everywhere between orders acts ages sexes they pro duce n molecular sexes on the line of ﬂight in relation to the dualism machines they cross right though The only way to get out of the dualism is to bebetween  1987 276277 Posthuman Sexuality From Ahumanity to Cosmogenic Desire What Deleuze and Guattari fail to express is that this constant unbeing of woman who promises so much for becoming exists at a place or a bebetween that woman neither made for herself nor resides in willingly Feminism has attempted to reappropriate the inbetween and abstractedness of womans representation in culture in order to afﬁrm female being and take away the power of namingher there which phallologocentrism exercises Feminisms reappropriation of womans otherness is as much about a will to power and attaining a voice as it is a making valuable of any position woman ﬁnds herself in Inherent in this ﬁght against subjectiﬁcation is the inability to speak her desire Sexuality or rather desire is the force of femininity not the body per se What Deleuze and Guattari do is make desirable the position without acknowledging the importance of speak ing and valuing the position in the process of its becoming desirable Woman needs to speak her own subversion as much for the speech as for the subversion As Braidotti points out The problem for Deleuze is how to disengage the subject position woman from the dua listic structure that opposes it to the masculine norm thereby reducing it to a mirror image of the same  To put it in more feminist terms the problem is also how to free woman from the subjugated position of annexed other so as to make her expressive of a differ ent difference of pure difference of an entirely new plane of becoming out of which dif ferences can multiply and differ from each other Here the focus is more on the experience and the potential becoming of real life women in all of their diverse ways of understanding and inhabiting the subject position woman 1994 115 We are in a similarly dubious situation with reference to posthuman sexualities if we take the cyborg turn however Many cybertheorists and organisations such as Humanity formerly the World Transhumanist Organisation which attempt to think transhumanist futurity such as that of Extropy ethically and accountably embody or disembody a commitment to the human which has overcome human ness primarily through overcoming ﬁnitude In this way deﬁnitions of subjectivity also ceases to be a spectre but this futurity necessarily repudiates the now beyond its usefulness for an inﬁnite tomorrowing so material immanence the newness of any dividuated lifes existence in relation with that of others is maligned Extropy could be described as the cyberbiotechnological version of humanist transcendental practice while Humanity exhibits anxieties about asymmetry in access distribution and manipulation Just as certain theorists see the posthuman as coming from an outside imposed upon the base material of the human so trans humant theory insinuates this cannot be enough as if there is an inherent ﬂaw in human materiality A paradigmatic equivalence could be made here between phal lologocentric economies of lack where the absence of the phallus or its threatened truncation or castration misses entirely the multiplicity and metamorphic morpho logical mucosity of the vulva Luce Irigaray and alternate ways of reading the body at all Antonin Artaud and Deleuze and Guattari The symbolic to asignify ing genitals addressing sexual difference as the ﬁrst step away from the majoritar ian human seem almost quaint when thinking the new grand narrative of the human itself thinking it in order to unthink it expunge it from its relationship with the humans who at worst question the category of the human only in order P MacCormack to exclude any limitations or accountabilities in reference to immanent existences of other lives including other human lives be they considered majoritarian human or minoritarian ﬂesh In the deiﬁcation of biotechnology the cyborgs attractive elements which can be found in the most rudimentary feminist queer postcolonial studies  the incomplete the hybrid the germinal through denial of access to signifying systems  are offered as a future design for the inﬁnite human It is as if all the very characteristics which made minoritarians abject have been apprehended by biotechnology with an adamant forgetting of their former use as tools of oppression Why signifying systems hated the minoritarian is why they love the cyborg This is primarily due to the fact that both repudiate the human But criticisms of the desire to enter into a becomingcyborg or becomingwoman remain  a perceived aversion to material speciﬁcity the privileging of an idea tional projection over a speciﬁc singular and unique event of existence a perpe tuation of the humanist turn to deﬁning even if via nondeﬁning fetishism and fear borne of the fact we are scared because we never were human in the ﬁrst place If desire and sexuality are the jubilant loci for posthumanism which addresses feminist concerns then they are also the loci for fear for the majoritarian This may be why post and transhumanist philosophies are still relatively ﬁne with reproduc tion in the bed or the test tube but recoil when having to deal with hereandnow concerns such as the lives which are without qualifying what they are and the cessation of human reproduction proposed so elegantly by a more material and ethical posthuman movements such as the human extinction movement and the Church of Euthanasia If the modern age delivered sexuality from reproduction the posthuman age has turned reproduction into a desire to live forever sterilising car nality by almost denying its importance Along with the perhaps seemingly nihilistic sounding but utterly afﬁrmative vindication of human extinction and care of immanent and living life posthuman sexuality performs over an immortalising obsession with lives yet to come into being posthuman sexualities have diversiﬁed toward monsters spiritualities with out theism and on a grander scale a cosmic understanding of connectivity that could be described as cosmogenic For this reason the word posthuman has been challenged ﬁrst with transhumanism but now the Ahuman is used to express a here and now excess which is the already posthuman inherent in concepts such as jouissance and desire see MacCormack 2014 Ahuman theory knows neither futurefetish nor nostalgia it reputes all bifurcations  of object and subject human and animal ﬁctive and factual  via what Irigaray would call mucosal desire and Serres a cosmogenic mode of interaction Where the posthuman fetishising of others critiqued in becomingwoman and animal but also any cooption of a non human or idea which is utilised as a cipher toward posthuman desiring is deeply problematic ahumanity seeks the liberation of human life from human traits and deﬁnitions  which are increasingly destructive and malignant in relation to the connectivity of life on earth without assimilating any one of those other forms of life Irigaray utilises a desiring relationship with angels which offers a fascinating way of introducing spirituality as a mystical but deeply material ethics indepen dent of God or Gods or goddesses as a schema for encounters with Outside but Posthuman Sexuality From Ahumanity to Cosmogenic Desire devoid of utilising a subaltern to achieve these encounters The consequences of such nonfulﬁllment of the sexual act remain  to take only the most beautiful example  let us consider the angels These messengers are never immobile nor do they ever dwell in one single place As mediators of what has not yet taken place these angels therefore open up the closed nature of the world identity action history 1992 173 Angelic love is formed of what Irigaray calls a muco sal consistency It ﬁnds itself alighting upon fabulated creatures This aligns with the turn to teratology by such theorists as Haraway Braidotti and MacCormack in feminist posthumanities whereby the fabulated creature demands imagination in reference to means of escape from fetishising posthuman discourses which perpe tuate phallic compulsions Irigaray utilises the mucosal model to foil the privile ging of binaries privileging of the visual and a repudiation of desire and abjection Nor will I ever see the mucous that most intimate interior of my ﬂesh neither the touch of the outside of the skin of my ﬁngers nor the perception of the inside of these same ﬁngers but another threshold of the passage from outside to inside from inside to outside between inside and outside between outside and inside Irigaray 1993 142 The angel both awaits as the not yet and is already the quickened with us Here the body effaces itself in order to call forth another body here the body is annihilated and becomes a tiny pile of ashes in order that the existence of other bodies may rise up the immense legion of angels of absence Serres 1995 45 The self becomes ashes from the burning of ecstasy and phoenixes pluralized This stands in marked juxtaposition against compulsion toward reproduction of the same of humans of acts of identities of perception and the manic need for extension of life the my of my life afﬁrmed in the my of my consistent perception of exhaustible meaning beginning with who I am and what I desire all defunct in posthuman sexuality Cosmogenics interrogates and relishes the inﬁnite teeming and potentialities of the immanent Universe which are inherently present in all ter ritories without cyborg fantasies or devolutionary cooptions Cosmogenics encourages expressivity in alterity as inﬁnite intensities and openness to affect all without the imposition of structure This is desire as ecstatic and activist a Spinozist ethical project From angels and monsters to the unbearable impercept ibility of all as desire and desire as all feminist posthuman sexualities trace a chaos of desire to elucidate the ways feminism was always both posthuman and ahuman and tactics by which experimental and celebratory posthuman sexualities can facilitate ethical affects to open the world to all expressions of life" .
