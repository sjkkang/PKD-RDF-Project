Posthuman_Animality,hasDefinition,"While the posthumanist animal studies that Der-

animal studies should locate, interpret, and challenge not only the 
animals “‘out there,’ among the birds and beasts, but ‘in here’ as 
well, at the heart of this thing we call human” (572)—it ought to 
do so without dismissing affectively informed fields of “socially and 
ethically responsive cultural studies” (568) for supposedly reifying 
wholesale the human as “knowing subject.”9 Rather than conforming 
to a single trajectory within animal studies, then, the study of hope in 
animal studies must draw across subfields and branches, following the 
trail of emotion past critical fractures while also questioning hope’s 
construction and apportionment within the wider constructions of 
humans, animals, and animality.",1

ing common to all living beings”).3 For biopolitical theory, the ani-
mality of the human becomes a central problem—­perhaps the central 
problem—­to be produced, controlled, or regulated for politics in its 
distinctly modern form.",1

instance, the case of feminist and race theories as the main

progressive humanism into the third millennium.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasCriticism,"Critical 
posthuman thought wants to re-assemble a discursive com-
munity out of the different, fragmented contemporary strands 
of posthumanism. I cannot help noticing, moreover, a rather bizarre and 
highly problematic division of labour on the question of 
subjectivity between science and technology studies on the

currents of the present, many of them exilic extraterritorial 
and unhoused. (2004: 11)
Fighting for such subaltern secular spaces is a priority for a 
posthuman quest for what is known in some quarters as a 
‘global ethic for global politics and economics’ (Kung, 1998). Paul Gilroy’s planetary cosmopolitanism (2000) also pro-
poses a productive form of contemporary critical posthuman-
ism.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"A primary task for 
posthuman critical theory therefore is to draw accurate and 
precise cartographies for these different subject positions as 
spring-boards towards posthuman recompositions of a pan-
human cosmopolitan bond. More speciﬁ cally, I would like to push the case further than 
Habermas’ social democratic aspiration and argue for a post-
human project of ‘becoming-minoritarian’ or becoming-
nomad of Europe (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987; Braidotti, 
2008).",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Against this self-glorifying image of a pretentious and egotis-
tical, narcissistic and paranoid consciousness, posthuman 
critical theory unleashes the multiple dynamic forces of zoe 
that do not coincide with the human, let alone with con-
sciousness. These non-essentialistic brands of vitalism frame 
the posthuman subject.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"As Deleuze and Guattari teach us, thinking is about the inven-
tion of new concepts and new productive ethical relations. In 
this respect, theory is a form of organized estrangement from 
dominant values. More clinical than critical, posthuman 
theory cuts to the core of classical visions of subjectivity and 
works towards an expanded vision of vitalist, transversal 
relational subjects.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"As a consequence, one can 
venture the preliminary conclusion that the main implication 
of posthuman critical theory for the practice of science is that 
the scientiﬁ c Laws need to be retuned according to a view of 
the subject of knowledge as a complex singularity, an affec-
tive assemblage and a relational vitalist entity. It follows from all this that the Humanities in the posthu-
man era of anthropocene should not stick to the Human – 
let alone ‘Man’ – as its proper object of study.",1

Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Conclusion
This chapter has traced my own itinerary out of the multiple 
possible genealogies of the posthuman, including the rise of 
alternative forms of critical posthumanism. These new forma-
tions are postulated on the demise of that ‘Man’ – the former 
measure of all things. Eurocentrism, masculinism and anthro-
pocentrism are exposed accordingly as complex and inter-
nally differentiated phenomena.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Critical Posthumanism
The third strand of posthuman thought, my own variation, 
shows no conceptual or normative ambivalence towards 
posthumanism. I want to move beyond analytic posthuman-
ism and develop afﬁ rmative perspectives on the posthuman 
subject. My inspiration for taking the jump into critical post-
Post-Humanism: Life beyond the Self 
humanism comes from my anti-humanist roots, of course.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"How can they adopt this approach 
to their own object of study? Posthuman Critical Theory
The Humanities can be inspired by these new trans-disciplin-
ary models of thought. The key to everything for me lies in 
the methodology and therefore I want to spell out the main 
criteria for posthuman theory, as a way of unfolding the new 
rules of the game, and try to apply them to the Humanities.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"In my own work, I deﬁ ne the critical posthuman subject 
within an eco-philosophy of multiple belongings, as a rela-
tional subject constituted in and by multiplicity, that is to say 
a subject that works across differences and is also internally 
differentiated, but still grounded and accountable. Posthu-
man subjectivity expresses an embodied and embedded and 
hence partial form of accountability, based on a strong sense 
of collectivity, relationality and hence community building.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"In the language of posthuman 
critical theory, this would produce the deception of a quan-
titative multiplicity which does not entail any qualitative 
shifts. To avoid this pitfall, which ﬁ ts in with the neo-liberal 
euphoria, and in order to enact qualitative transformations 
instead, we need to be equally distanced from both hyped-up 
disembodiment and fantasies of trans-humanist escape, and 
from re-essentialized, centralized notions of liberal individu-
alism.",1

Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Posthuman critical 
thought does not aim at mastery, but at the transformation 
of negative into positive passions. Life is desire which essentially aims at expressing itself and 
consequently runs on entropic energy: it reaches its aim and 
then dissolves, like salmon swimming upstream to procreate 
and then die. The wish to die can consequently be seen as the 
counterpart and as another expression of the desire to live 
intensely.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Posthuman critical theory needs to apply a new vision of 
subjectivity to both the practice and the public perception of 
the scientist, which is still caught in the classical and out-
moded model of the humanistic ‘Man of reason’ (Lloyd, 
1984) as the quintessential European citizen. We need to 
overcome this model and move towards an intensive form of 
interdisciplinarity, transversality, and boundary-crossings 
among a range of discourses.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"The 
posthuman recomposition of human interaction that I propose 
is not the same as the reactive bond of vulnerability, but 
is an afﬁ rmative bond that locates the subject in the ﬂ ow of 
relations with multiple others. As we shall see in the next chapter, for me there is a neces-
sary link between critical posthumanism and the move beyond 
anthropocentrism. I refer to this move as expanding the 
notion of Life towards the non-human or zoe.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"The image of the 
philosopher as the legislator of knowledge and the judge of 
truth – a model rooted in the Kantian school – is the exact 
opposite of what posthuman critical theory is arguing for: 
post-identitarian, non-unitary and transversal subjectivity 
based on relations with human and non-human others.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"These in-between 
states defy the established modes of theoretical representation 
because they are zigzagging, not linear and process-oriented, 
not concept-driven. Critique and creation strike a new deal 
in actualizing the practice of conceptual personae or ﬁ gura-
tion as the active pursuit of afﬁ rmative alternatives to the 
dominant vision of the subject. Zigzagging is indeed the operative word for the next build-
ing block of posthuman critical theory, namely non-linearity.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"To clarify this vision, Guattari proposes 
three fundamental ecologies: that of the environment, of the 
social nexus, and of the psyche. More importantly, he empha-
sizes the need to create transversal lines through all three of 
them. This clariﬁ cation is important and I would connect it 
to the theoretical reminder I issued earlier, namely that we 
need to practise de-familiarization as a crucial method in 
posthuman critical theory and learn to think differently.",1
Critical_Posthumanism,hasReference,"An altogether different and powerful source of inspiration

the non-human or ‘earth’ others. This practice of relating to

tred individualism.",1

terrain of the gendered body. Limbo creates that imaginary geography and
/

imbues it with the hypnagogic force of a nightmare.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"For Humberto Maturana, the problem of system definition was solved 
by positing a circular dynamic whereby the living continually produces and 
reproduces the relations constituting its organization. In effect, he turned 
first -wave cybernetics inside out.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"For Wiener, analogy was communication, and communication was 
analogy. Objecting that cybernetics is ""merely an analogy"" was for him akin 
to saying that cybernetics is ""merely about how we know the world."" 
The problem with this approach lies not so much in the analogical rela-
tions that Wiener constructed between living and mechanical systems as in 
his tendency to erase from view the very real differences in embodied ma-
teriality, differences that the analogies did not express.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"In establishing the focus as ""problems of communication,"" Fremont-
Smith hoped the Macy group would see that the topic required an ""intensive 
and comprehensive study of man."" Thus the sciences were to be unified by an 
overarching framework that could simultaneously explain ""man"" and the 
people who studied ""man."" Cybernetics was to provide that framework.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"In her con-
textualized account, McCulloch's fierce commitment to an ""empirical 
epistemology"" carries with it an obvious price-a tendency toward de-
contextualization that made him less than effective in communicating 
with this audience. Catherine Bateson included in her prologue Gregory Bateson's docu-
ment that set the agenda for the conference and laid out the problems it 
would explore. The influence of cybernetics as it had evolved during the 
Macy Conferences is apparent throughout.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"In the next 
section, we ,vill see how this anxiety erupts into his 1948 book Cybernetics 
at critical pOints, causing him to withdraw from the more subversive impli-
cations of the diSCipline he fathered. It is no accident that erotic metaphors 
are used to carry the thrust of the argument. Like cybernetics, eroticism is
intensely concerned with the problematics of body boundaries. It is not for 
nothing that sexual orgasm is called ""the little death"" or that writers from 
Marquis de Sade to J.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"Like Maturana, Varela, and other scientific researchers in the
second wave of cybernetics, Dick is intensely concerned with epistemolog-
ical questions and their relation to the cybernetic paradigm. The problem 
of where to locate the observer-in or out of the system being observed?-
is conflated in his fiction with how to determine whether a creature is an-
droid or human.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"Maturana 
did not identifY with cybernetics as much as Bateson did, and he did not 
generally use that term to describe his work. Nevertheless, his theory took 
up certain problems that were left hanging after the Macy Conferences 
ended. Like Bateson, Maturana found reflexivity more promising than 
homeostasis. Also like Bateson, he both appropriated concepts from the 
Macy context and changed them profoundly.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"More than the definition of purpose, it was 
these larger inscriptions that made ""Behavior, Purpose, and Teleology"" the 
founding document for cybernetics. One of the most frequent criticisms made of cybernetics during this pe-
riod was that it was not really a new science but was merely an extended 
analogy (men are like machines). Wiener heard the charge often enough 
that he finally felt it was time to take the cybernetic bull by the horns.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"Nevertheless, the idea hung in the air, and a few key thinkers-especially 
Margaret Mead, Gregory Bateson, and Heinz von Foerster-resolved to 
pursue it after the Macy Conferences ran out of steam. The second wave of cybernetics grew out of attempts to incorporate re-
flexivity into the cybernetic paradigm at a fundamental level. The key issue 
was how systems are constituted as such, and the key problem was how to 
redefine homeostatic systems so that the observer can be taken into 
account.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"The McCulloch-Pitts neuron was 
the primary model through which cybernetics was seen as having"" a setting 
in the flesh,"" as Warren McCulloch put it. The problem was how to move 
from this stripped-down neural model to such complex issues as universals 
in thought, gestalts in perception, and representations of what a system 
cannot represent.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"The essential problem here is not primarily one of definitions, although 
the problem becomes manifest at these sites in the text because definitions 
are used to anchor the argument, which otherwise drifts off into such neb-
ulous terms as ""natural drift."" Rather, the difficulties arise because of Mat-
The Second Wave of Cybernetics / 
urana's passionate desire to have something conserved in the midst of con-
tinuous change.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"The problem that engaged him when 
he fell ill and felt the flapping curtain woven into the mathematics was a 
boundary problem, having to do with what happens to an electrical field 
around a sharp physical discontinuity. In his later work on cybernetics, 
boundary formation and analogical linking collaborate to create a discur-
sive field in which animals, humans, and machines can be treated as equiv-
alent cybernetic systems.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"The problem, of 
course, was that cybernetics adapted all too readily to Manichean tactics, 
making it possible to play these deadly games even more effectively. \Viener's war work, combined with his antimilitary stance after the war, 
illustrates with startling clarity how cybernetics functioned as a source of 
both intense pride and intense anxiety for him.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"This meant they had no 
handle with which to grasp this slippery concept, no Signifier that would help 
to constitute as well as to describe the changed perspective that reflexivity 
entails. Discussions of the idea remained diffuse. Most participants did not 
go beyond remarking on the shifting boundaries between observer and sys-
tem that cybernetics puts into play. With some exceptions, deeper formula-
tions of the problem failed to coalesce during the Macy discussions.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasCriticism,"Underlying this construction, 
however, is a complex series of events, with its own seriated history of engi-
neering problems, material forms, and bureaucratic structures-a history 
that James Beniger has written about so well in The Control Revolution: 
Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society.15 In 
broad outline, the forms of control moved from mechanical (a cam direct-
ing a mechanical rod to follow a certain path) to thermodynamic (a gover-
nor directing the action of a heat engine) to informational (cybernetic 
mechanisms of all kinds, from computers to the hypothalamus understood 
in cybernetic terms).",1

ply the science of building machines that will duplicate and improve on the 
organs and functions of the animal, based on what we know about the sys-
tems of communication and control in the animal,"" the narrator says.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"1 Drawing on the scientific literature on 
cybernetics, Dick's narratives extend the scope of inquiry by staging con-
nections between cybernetics and a wide range of concerns, including a 
devastating critique of capitalism, a view of gender relations that ties to-
gether females and androids, an idiosyncratic connection between entropy 
and schizophrenic delusion, and a persistent suspicion that the objects sur-
rounding us-and indeed reality itself-are fakes.",1

Wiener was not unaware of the ironies through which cybernetics would 
imperil the very liberal humanist subject whose origins are enmeshed with 
self-regulating machinery. Throughout his mature writings, he stmggled to 
reconcile the tradition of liberalism with the new cybernetic paradigm he 
was in the process of creating. When I think of him, I imagine him labOring 
mightily to constmct the mirror of the cyborg.",1

Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Already fascinated 
with epistemological questions that reveal how shaky our constructions of

potent connections between cybernetics and contemporary understand-
ings of race, gender, and sexuality.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Although a reflexive view of cybernetics 
failed to coalesce into a coherent theory during the Macy Conferences, 
Bateson did not want to let the idea go. He determined to go ahead on his

implications of cybernetics could provide the basis for a new epistemology,

Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"As we saw in chapter 4, the prob-

these complexities. In Dick's fiction, the schizoid functions as if autistic. Typically gendered female, she is often represented as a bright, cold, emo-
tionally distant woman.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"At the same time that cybernetics was re-
configuring the body as an informational system, it was also presenting 
itself as a science of information that would remap intellectual terrains. Branching out into diSCiplines as different as biology, psychology, and elec-

selves disappear in this construction. Thus, Wiener decides that however
might be, cybernetics is better off remaining celibate.",1

link between liberal humanism and self-regulation, a link forged in the 
eighteenth century, was already stretched thin; by the 1980s, it was largely 
broken. It is to Wiener's credit that he tried to craft a version of cybernetics 
that would enhance rather than subvert human freedom. But no person, 
even the father of a discipline, can single-handedly control what cybernet-

a transitional figure linking first- and second-wave cybernetics.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Far from 
being a passive confirmation, information theory was an active extension of 
a probabilistic worldview into the new and powerfully synthetic realm of 
communication theory. We can now understand on a deeper level Wiener's

perspective would succeed, he thought, because it reflects the way that 
we-as finite, imperfect creatures-know the universe.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Feminist 
theorists have pointed out that it has historically been constructed as a 
white European male, presuming a universality that has worked to sup-

also with the very idea of a unified, consistent identity, fOCUSing instead on 
hybridity; and postmodern theorists such as Gilles Deleuze and Felix 
Guattari have linked it with capitalism, arguing for the liberatory potential 
of a dispersed subjectivity distributed among diverse desiring machines 
they call ""body without organs.""7 Although the deconstruction of the lib-

that he both feared and helped to initiate.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"HistOrically, that arena was first 
defined in cybernetiCS by the creation of a conceptual framework that con-
stitutedhumans, animals, and machines as information-processing devices 
receiving and transmitting Signals to effect goal-directed behavior.25 
Gibson matches this technical achievement with two literary innovations 
that allow subjectivity, with its connotations of consciousness and self-
awareness, to be articulated together with abstract data.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Homeostasis, a foundational concept during the first wave, func-
tioned during the second wave as a skeuomotph. Although homeostasis 
remained an important concept in biology, by about 1960 it had ceased to 
be an initiating premise in cybernetics. Instead, it performed the work of a 
gesture or an allusion used to authenticate new elements in the emerging 
constellation of reflexivity.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"If these analogical mappings kept the enemy pilot 
from being demonized, they also made the cybernetic machine (and, byex-
tension, cybernetics itself) party to a bloody struggle in which Manichean 
tactics were used by both sides to kill as many humans as pOSSible. Partly in reaction to this co-optation of cybernetics by the military, 
Wiener half a decade after the war wrote the Significantly entitled The Hu-
man Use of Human Beings.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"If those arrangements were to disappear as they appeared, if some 
event of which we can at the moment do no more than sense the 
possibility—­without knowing either what its form will be or what it 
promises—­were to cause them to crumble, as the ground of Classical 
thought did, at the end of the eighteenth century, then one can cer-
tainly wager that man would be erased, like a face drawn in sand at the 
edge of the sea.1
By way of another well-­known genealogy—­one also directly relevant 
to this book—­posthumanism may be traced to the Macy conferences 
on cybernetics from 1946 to 1953 and the invention of systems the-
ory involving Gregory Bateson, Warren McCulloch, Norbert Wiener, 
John von Neumann, and many other figures from a range of fields who 
converged on a new theoretical model for biological, mechanical, and

Diamond advances in Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Soci-

mented evolutionary history, and it is naive to think that this history does 
not affect human behaviors at every level of thought and action. Of course, the reflexivity that looms large in cybernetics also inhabits 
evolutionary biology.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"In the end, how-
ever, his resistance to the splice fails to restrain the scarier implications of 
cybernetics, much as Wiener's resistance to the cybernetic penetration of 
boundaries failed to prevent the dissolution of the liberal humanist subject.",1

fare has been replaced by a Superpower Olympics between the capitalist 
Inland Strip and the communist East Union, a competition deSigned 
to sublimate lethal violence into healthy competition. But in the 1990 
Olympics, as if in recognition of Wiener's failure to prevent the promiscu-
ous coupling of cybernetiCS with military research after World War II, cy-
borg competition neologistically slides into warfare rather than 
metonymically substitutes for it.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"In this integrated circuit, the physical body of the text and the bodies 
represented within the text evolve together toward a posthuman, post-

localized, bodies of print are punctuated with prostheses, and boundaries 
of many kinds are destabilized. More than a conduit through which ideas 
from cybernetics boiled into the wider U. S.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"In this model, it is not a question ofleaving the body behind 
but rather of extending embodied awareness in highly specific, local, and 
material ways that would be impossible without electronic prosthesis. As we have seen, cybernetics was born in a froth of noise when Norbert 
Wiener first thought of it as a way to maximize human potential in a world 
that is in essence chaotic and unpredictable.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"In this sense, Limbo follows the line of thought that 
Wiener mapped out in CybernetiCS, down to particular phrasings that 
Wolfe appropriates. Because in many respects Wolfe follows Wiener so 
closely, the departure he makes in insisting on the typographic hyphen 
rather than the cybernetiC splice is even more Significant.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"In this view, the dualism between subject and 
object disappears, for the object as a thing in itself cannot exist for us. There 
is only the subjective, inner world. The world, as this ""cybernetics"" con-

sciences (think here of Foucault’s interest in Jacob and Canguilhem,

determinate circuitry of cyborg gender. As a white male writing in the early 1950s, Wolfe was aware that the pol-
itics of gender relations were beginning to shift. Several times, the narrator 
mentions ""women's liberation,"" quarantined by quotation marks and au-
thorial scorn. Nevertheless, even he cannot escape the feminine within.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Mingling erotically charged violations with potent new fusions, the cyborg 
becomes the stage on which are performed contestations about the body 
boundaries that have often marked class, ethnic, and cultural differences. Especially when it operates in the realm of the Imaginary rather than 
through actual physical operations (which act as a reality check on fantasies 
about cyborgism), cybernetics intimates that body boundaries are up for 
grabs.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"More than a technology, they 
functioned as an ideology. Without mentioning Wolfe, Douglas D. Noble, 
in ""Mental Materiel: The Militarization of Learning and Intelligence in 
U.S. Education,"" argues that the cybernetiC paradigm has in fact brought 
about massive transformations in V.S. social, economic, and educational 
infrastructures, as Wolfe predicted it would. 14 In his view, these transfor-
mations have been driven primarily by the V. S. military.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Moreover, her notion of mutation as an external force 
points, as Bruce Clarke has recently put it, toward “a radical distinc-
tion between matter and information, substance and form,” one that 
remains “in a realm of dialectical antithesis, which observes that the 
concept of the human has lost its balance and/or its foundations, and

that responds either with lament or delight.”18 But what is needed here, 
as Rutsky rightly points out, is the recognition that “any notion of the 
posthuman that is to be more than merely an extension of the human, 
that is to move beyond the dialectic of control and lack of control, 
super­human and inhuman, must be premised upon a mutation that is 
ongoing and immanent,” and this means that to become posthuman 
means to participate in—­and find a mode of thought adequate to—
“processes which can never be entirely reduced to patterns or stan-
dards, codes or information.”19
In this light, it is worth recalling Clarke’s suggestion that the dia-
lectical antithesis of matter and information corresponds to the first-
­order cybernetics of midcentury,20 while the mutational, as Rutsky 
rightly understands it, points toward the necessity of a different logic, 
one consonant, as Clarke has pointed out by quoting Gregory Bateson’s 
suggestion three decades ago that “the whole of logic would have to 
be reconstructed for recursiveness”: a logic that is fundamental to the 
second-­order systems theory that will be articulated in these pages.",1

tem boundaries have become radically unstable.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Obliterated or for-
gotten is the matrix in which these arcs are embedded. A truly cybernetic 
approach, for Bateson, concentrates on the couplings that bind the parts 
into interactive wholes. The revisionist thrust of Gregory's view of cybernetics is apparent in a 
letter he wrote to Catherine in June 1977, a year after his interview with 
Stewart Brand. The letter begins with Gregory remarking on how reread-
ing Our Own Metaphor vividly brought the conference back to his mind.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Of Molecules and Men: Cybernetics and Probability 
Like Venus, cybernetics was born from the froth of chaos. Wiener's impor-
tant early work was done on Brownian motion, the random motion that 
molecules make as they collide with each other, bounce off each other, and 
collide again, as if they were manic bumper cars. 11 Given this chaos, it is im-
possible to know the microstates in enough detail to predict from the laws 
of motion how individual molecules will behave.",1

ences; they are not intrinsic to the autopoietic processes in themselves. Let's say I see a blue jay flash through the trees and settle on the birdbath.",1

ics to create more effective killing machines (as Peter Galison has noted),7 
applying cybernetics to self-correcting radar tuning, automated antiair-

the cybernetic machine in the image of a humanistic self.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Once the correlation is made, cybernetics can 
be used not only to correct dysfunction but also to improve normal func-

discourse systems.",1

Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Retrospectively called 
the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics, these meetings, held from 1943 to 
1954, were instrumental in forging a new paradigm.12 To succeed, they 
needed a theory of information (Shannon's bailiwick), a model of neural 
functioning that showed how neurons worked as information-processing 
systems (McCulloch's lifework), computers that processed binary code and 
that could conceivably reproduce themselves, thus reinforcing the analogy 
with biolOgical systems (von Neumann's specialty), and a visionary who 
could articulate the larger implications of the cybernetic paradigm and 
make clear its cosmic significance (Wiener's contribution).",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"See also Norbert Wiener, ""Cybernetics (Light 
and Maxwell's Demon),"" Scientia (Italy) 87 (1952): 233-35, reprinted in Norbert 
Wiener: Collected Works, vol. 4, pp. 203-5. 46. Michael Serres plays multiple riffs on this idea in The Parasite, translated by 
Lawrence R. Schehr (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982). 47.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Seen in this way, analogy is a crucial operator in every-
thing from Wiener's passion for mathematics to his advocacy of ""black box"" 
engineering and behaviorist philosophy. Indeed, cybernetics as a diScipline 
could not have been created without analogy. When analogy is used to con-
stitute agents in cybernetic discourse, it makes an end run around ques-
tions of essence, for objects are constructed through their relations to other 
objects.",1

behavior can orient himself towards himself, and then generate communica-

Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Shaped 
by different conventions, the literary texts range across a spectrum ofissues 
that the scientific texts only fitfully illuminate, including the ethical and cul-
tural implications of cybernetiC technologies:4o 
Literary texts are not, of course, merely passive conduits. They actively 
shape what the technolOgies mean and what the scientific theories signify 
in cultural contexts. They also embody assumptions similar to those that 
permeated the scientific theories at critical points.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"So far the novel reads like 
a devil's dictionary of sexist beliefs that are Neolithic even by the standards 
of the 1950s. Yet at the same time, the text also edges toward a realization 
that it cannot unequivocally articulate. Like man and machine, male and 
female are spliced together in a feedback circuit that makes them mutually 
determine each other. No less than geopolitical ideology, sexual ideology is 
subverted and reconfigured by the cybernetic paradigm.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Some attributes change from one model to the next, but others remain 
the same. As figure 1 illustrates, the conceptual shifts that took place during the 
development of cybernetics display a seriated pattern reminiscent of mate-
rial changes in artifacts. Conceptual fields evolve similarly to material cul-
ture, in part because concept and artifact engage each other in continuous 
feedback loops.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Sometimes Maturana's figure authorizes the boxed 
comments, sometimes Varela's, and sometimes both together. Even with-
out the boxes, it is not difficult to discern that Varela's voice is stronger in 
The Tree of Knowledge than in Autopoiesis and Cognition. The Second Wave of Cybernetics I 
I take Varela's Buddhist orientation to be the inspiration behind what 
the authors announce as a central idea, ""all doing is knowing and all know-
ing is doing"" (p. 27).",1

Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Specifically, this lens obscures ""the cybernetic 
nature of self and the world,"" an obfuscation that ""tends to be imperceptible 
to consciousness"" (OOM, p.16). Nowhere is the transformation that Gregory worked on the Macy Con-
ferences clearer than in what he considers the"" cybernetic nature"" of world 
and self. For him, cybernetics is no longer the homeostatic model of the 
Macy Conferences (although echoes of this language still linger ).",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The Argument for Celibacy: Preserving 
the Boundaries of the Subject 
In Cybernetics, the technical text from which The Human Use of Human 
Beings was adapted, Wiener looks into the mirror of the cyborg but then 
withdraws.50 The scenarios he constructs to enact and justifY this with-
drawal suggestively point to the role that erotic anxiety plays in cybernetic 
narratives.",1

Chapter Four 
Julian Bigelow and Arturo Rosenblueth, ""Behavior, Purpose, and Teleol-
ogy.""24 Offering an agenda for the nascent field of cybernetics, this work 
also created a discursive style that produced the objects of its analysis. ""Behavior, Purpose, and Teleology"" begins by contrasting behaviorism 
with functionalism.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The closest that Wiener comes to a critique 
of these complicities is a rigid machine he constmcts in opposition to the 
cybernetic machine. This alien and alienating machine is invested with 
qualities he wants to purge from cybernetics, including rigidity, oppres-
sion, militaristic regulation of thought and action, reduction of humans to 
antlike elements, manipulation, betrayal, and death.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The conjunction of erotic anxiety and intellectual speculation in 
Wiener's text implies that cybernetics cannot be adequately understood 
simply as a theoretic and technological extension of information theory.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The contrast shows how central the concept of the autono-
mous self is to cybernetics as Wiener envisioned it. The savage makes one last appearance in Wiener's anxious considera-
tion of how tightly the scientist can be coupled with his object without los-
ing his objectivity. To illustrate the dangers of tight coupling, Wiener 
observes that primitive societies are very often changed by the anthropolo-
gists who observe them.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The development of cybernetics followed neither a Kuhnian model of 
incommensurable paradigms nor a Foucauldian model of sharp epistemic 
breaks.27 In the history of cybernetics, ideas were rarely made up out of 
whole cloth. Rather, they were fabricated in a pattern of overlapping repli-
cation and innovation, a pattern that I call ""seriation"" (a term appropriated 
from archaeolOgical anthropology). A brief explanation may clarifY this 
concept.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The emphasis on pattern constructed bodies as 
im material flows of information; the alternating emphasis on structure rec-
ognized that these ""black boxes"" were heavy with materiality. Complex 
couplings between the two registers worked to set up a series of exchanges 
between biological organisms and machines. To see how these couplings 
evolved, let us start with the exchanges that thermodynamiCS set up and fol-
low them forward into cybernetiCS.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The environ-
ment merely triggers changes determined by the system's own structural 
properties. Thus the center of interest for autopoiesis shifts from the cy-
bernetics of the observed system to the cybernetics of the observer. Au-
topoiesis also changes the explanation of what circulates through the 
system to make it work as a system. The emphasis now is on the mutually 
constitutive interactions between the components of a system rather than 
on message, signal, or information.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The framework of scientific inquiry 
had been constructed so as to ignore the observer. Heinz von Foerster, in his letter to Fremont-Smith, saw the inclusion of 
the observer as the central issue of cybernetics.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The larger trajectory of my narrative arcs from the initial moments when 
cybernetics was formulated as a discipline, through a period of reformula-
tion known as ""second-order cybernetics,"" to contemporary debates 
swirling around an emerging discipline known as ""artificial life."" Although 
the progression is chronolOgical, this book is not meant to be a history of cy-
bernetics.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The metaphors also have literal meanings that re-
veal how intermingled the physical remains with the conceptual, the erotic 
with the cybernetic. As gestures of separation disconcertingly transform 
into couplings, the cybernetics of the subject and the subject of cybernetics 
interpenetrate. Wiener works up to the fantasy by pointing out that there are many or-
ganizations whose parts are themselves small organizations.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The narrator seems only partially able to control his verbally 
extravagant narrative. There are, I will argue, deep connections between 
the narrator's struggle to maintain control of the narrative and the threat 
to ""natural"" body boundaries posed by the cybernetiC paradigm. Limbo in-
terrogates a dynamiC that also appears in Norbert Wiener's work-the in-
tense anxiety that erupts when the perceived boundaries of the body are 
breached.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The objectivist view sees information flOwing from the system to the ob-
servers, but feedback can also loop through the observers, drawing them in 
to become part of the system being observed. Although participants re-
marked on this aspect of the cybernetic paradigm throughout the Macy 
transcripts, they lacked a single word to describe it. To my knowledge, the 
word ""reflexivity"" does not appear in the transcripts.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"The reappearance of the savage here is Significant, 
for anxiety about the manipulation of desire is reaching its height. No doubt 
this reappearance has a soothing effect on Wiener's imagination, for it re-
minds him that he need not be manipulated after all. We come now to the crux of the argument. The danger of cybernetics, 
from Wiener's point of view, is that it can potentially annihilate the liberal 
subject as the locus of control.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"These mappings throw a different light 
on his attempts to reconcile cybernetics with a liberal humanist subject. If 
meaning is constituted through relation, then juxtaposing men and ma-
chines goes beyond bringing two preexisting objects into harmonious rela-
tion. Rather, the analogical relation constitutes both terms through the 
process of articulating their relationship. To see this meaning-making in 
process, let us tum now to a consideration of analogy in Wiener's texts and 
practices.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"They illustrate the con-
struction of bodies both as material objects and as probability distributions. The duality that Seltzer locates in nineteenth-century culture continued 
into the twentieth century with renewed force when statistical thermody-
namics merged with information theory. One of the principal sites for this 
merger was cybernetics.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"They locate its ori-
gins in cybernetics, referencing William Grey Walter's electronic tortoise 
and Ross Ashby'S homeostat. Although some characteristics of autopoiesis 
are reinscribed on the successor field of Artificial Life, especially the idea 
that systems are operationally closed, other features are new. The change is 
signaled in Varela's subtle reconception of autonomy.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"This alternating focus on behavior and internal structure is similar to the 
rhetorical strategies that Geof Bowker analyzes in his article shOwing how 
cybernetics constituted itself as a universal science.27 Bowker points out 
that cybernetics positioned itself both as a metascience and as a tool that 
any other science could use.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"This chapter explores the 
elements that came together to form the homeostasis constellation; it also 
demonstrates the chain of associations that bound refleXivity together with 
subjectivity during the Macy period, which fix many of the phYSical scien-
tists was enough to relegate reflexivity to the category of ""nonscience"" 
rather than ""science."" Tracing the development of reflexive epistemologies 
after the Macy period ended, the chapter concludes by showing how re-
flexivitywas modified so that it could count as prodUCing scientific knowl-
edge during the second wave of cybernetics.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"This move, familiar 
to us as the Platonic backhand, made embodied reality into a blurred and 
messy instantiation of the clean abstractions oflogical forms. Unlike others 
who make this move, however, McCulloch never relinquished his commit-
ment to embodiment. The tension between logical form and embodiment 
in his work displays how the construction of a weightless information was 
complicated when cybernetics moved into the intimate context of the 
body's own neural functioning.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"This tension, often ex-
pressed as an anxious desire to limit the scope of cybernetics, takes a differ-
ent but related form when he considers the question of body boundaries, 
always a highly charged issue. When the physical boundaries of the human 
form are secure, he celebrates the flow of information through the organ-
ism. All this changes, however, when the boundaries cease to define an au-
tonomous self, either through manipulation or engulfment.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasDefinition,"Thus, he considered not many sets within one 
world but many worlds generated from a Single set or, in Wiener's phrase, 
""all the worlds which are possible answers to a limited set of questions con-
cerning our environment."" So important did Wiener consider this perspec-
tive that he argued, ""It is with this point of view at its core that the new

Of all the implications that first-wave cybernetics conveyed, perhaps none

argues that “the entire field covered by the cybernetic program will be 
the field of writing,” but writing understood in terms of “the grammè—

changes in speed and communication were forcing technologies of control 
into a reorganization that would result in the computer revolution and 
when the cold war loomed large in the national consciousness. It was in this

Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasExample,"Although researchers in the physical and human sci-
ences acknowledged the importance of materiality in different ways, they 
nevertheless collaborated in creating the postmodem ideology that the 
body's materiality is secondary to the lOgical or semiotic structures it en-
codes. It is not difficult to find pronouncements supporting an ideology of dis-
embodiment in cultural theory, no less than in cybernetiCS. Consider, for 
example, the follOwing claims.",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasExample,"For example, 
chapter 4, on Wiener's scientific work, is interlaced with analyses of the nar-
ratives he tells to resolve conflicts between cybernetics and liberal human-
ism, and chapter 9, on artificial life, is organized by looking at this area of 
research as a narrative field. What does this emphasis on narrative have to do with virtual bodies?",1
Cybernetic_Enhancement,hasExample,"The living being does 
indeed represent the execution of a plan, but not one conceived in any 
mind.”5 Derrida would add to this, however, the point he presses in Of 
Grammatology:
If the theory of cybernetics is by itself to oust all metaphysical 
concepts—­including the concepts of soul, of life, of value, of choice, of 
memory—­which until recently served to separate the machine from 
man, it must conserve the notion of writing, trace, grammè [written 
mark], or grapheme, until its own historico-­metaphysical character is 
exposed.6
As an example of such “character,” interestingly enough, Derrida cites 
in a footnote not Jacob but the first-­generation systems theorist Norbert 
Wiener, who “while abandoning ‘semantics,’ and the opposition, judged 
by him as too crude and too general, between animate and inanimate
meaning and event
etc., nevertheless continues to use expressions like ‘organs of sense,’ 
‘motor organs,’ etc.",1

Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"The Argument for Celibacy: Preserving 
the Boundaries of the Subject 
In Cybernetics, the technical text from which The Human Use of Human 
Beings was adapted, Wiener looks into the mirror of the cyborg but then 
withdraws.50 The scenarios he constructs to enact and justifY this with-
drawal suggestively point to the role that erotic anxiety plays in cybernetic 
narratives.",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"The breakdown of Wolfe's ""hyphenation"" theory occurs, perhaps pre-
dictably, when the hyphen is no longer sufficient to contain the repressed 
violence that the cyborg unleashes (uncannily so, for the text operates as if 
Wolfe were unconsciously reenacting, from Wiener's war work on antiair-
craft devices, the mapping of enemy onto self).",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"The cyborg's 
discourse is that of difference, its politics of transgression/subversion, an<i its 
social identity gives it no roots. It is more than an illegitimate offspring; it is an 
""orphean;"" beingits·own origin and its own end.",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"The cyborg, Noble 
insists, is no science fiction fantasy but an accurate image of the modern 
American soldier, including pilots wired into ""intelligent cockpits,"" ar-
tillery gunners connected to computerized guidance systems, and infantry 
soldiers whose ground attacks are instantaneously broadcast on global tele-
vision.",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"The first
 wave of theorization surrounding the concept
 of posthumanism?the philosophical ques
 tioning of the centrality of the human?by
 such scholars as Donna Haraway and N. Kath
 erine Hayles focused mainly on the figure of
 the cyborg and on machine-based forms of
 consciousness.",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"The grounding assumptions for individuality shift from self-pos-
session to organizational closure and the reflexivity of a system recur-
sively operating on its own representations. A status report, then: information's body is still contested, the empire of 
the cyborg is still expanding, and the liberal subject, although more than 
ever an autonomous individual, is literally lOSing its mind as the seat of 
identity.",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"The paradigmatic cyborg for autopoiesis is the state, not the kind of me-
chanical human imagined by Bernard Wolfe or Philip K. Dick. Third, au-
topoietic theory preserves the autonomy and individuality characteristic 
ofliberal humanism, but it sees thinking as a secondary effect that arises 
when an autopoietic entity interacts with its own representations. Self-
consciousness, a subset of thinking, is relegated to a purely linguistic 
effect.",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"The political line of questioning has to start from this ﬁ rm 
location to raise some key questions about subjectivity. For 
instance, Katherine Hayles argues, ‘What do gendered bodies 
have to do with the erasure of embodiment and the subse-
quent merging of machine and human intelligence in the 
ﬁ gure of the cyborg?’ (Hayles, 1999: xii).",1

Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"The salient point here inmyargmnent is that

Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"The stories I tell here-how informa-
tion lost its body, how the cyborg was created as a cultural icon and techno-
lOgical artifact, and how humans became posthumans-and the waves of 
historical change I chart would not have the same resonance or breadth if 
they had been pursued only through literary texts or only through scientific 
discourses.",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"The third, 
deeply implicated with the first two, is the unfolding story of how a histori-
cally specific construction called the human is giving way to a different con-
struction called the posthuman. Interrelations between the three stories are extensive. Central to the 
construction of the cyborg are informational pathways connecting the or-
ganic body to its prosthetic extensions.",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"These cyborgs are called (in a twinning pun that tries to 
encompass the cyborg under the sign of the hyphen) ""Pro-pros."" The logic 
of the hyphen dictates that Pro-pros be mirrored by Anti-pros, who believe 
that cyborgism is a perversion oflmmob philosophy. Anti-pros spend their 
days proselytizing for voluntary amputation, using microphones hooked up 
to the baby baskets that are just the right size to accommodate their limb-
less human torsos, a detail that later becomes significant.",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"They illus-
trate the complex dynamiCS that marked the constmction of the cyborg 
during the foundational period of the late 1940s and 1950s. As this brief summary suggests, to engage Wiener's work is to be stmck 
by contradiction. Envisioning powerful new ways to equate humans and 
machines, he also spoke up strongly for liberal humanist values. A talk given 
to an audience of physiCians in 1954 illustrates the breadth of his concern 
and ambivalence ..",1

Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"This list is meant to be seductive, for over the space of a comma, it moves 
from modifications intended to compensate for deficiencies to inter-
ventions designed to enhance normal functioning. Once this splice is 
passed, establishing conceptual limits to the process becomes difficult. In 
""A Manifesto for Cyborgs,"" Donna Haraway wrote about the potential of 
the cyborg to disrupt traditional categories.",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"Thns, since the cyborg destabilizes our sense of ontology andjdentity, some-
thing has happenedin the tableau ofnature and made a change from What are 
we? to Who are we? It is a shift from the structural level---macbine and organ-
ism as information-processingsystems-to 
the functional level~ma9bine and

eighteenth and nineteenth century ..",1
Cyborg_Theory,hasDefinition,"To equate ""life"" 
with subjectivity is to go back before a Copernicianrevolution and put humans 
at the center of the world. I would say, with Haraway, lhat the cyborg construct 
of postmodern culture is necessary to deconstruct boundaries and to open a new 
space of subjectivity/identity. However, in the way it is represented in the ques-
tion of ""living,"" the cyborg is a discursive space where the crisis of postmodern 
thought occurs. In both Star Trek and Blade Runner.",1

the posthuman, it is important to recognize that the construction of the 
posthuman does not require the subject to be a literal cyborg. Whether or

emerging from such fields as cognitive science and artificial life imply that 
even a biologically unaltered Homo sapiens counts as posthuman.",1

would very much seek and welcome a new kind of terminology to refer to what we 
think as art, but for now, because there is no vocabulary of and for art’s thingness in 
a posthuman context (and to develop one reducibly would be anathema to the very 
problem) all that can be offered in the context of Posthuman Ethics is that humans 
can create things through recombining matter that are independent of epistemes 
which support the valuation of use based on production as reproduction.",1

Much has been written on the rights of non-dominant others and their

much of Posthuman Ethics deals with the inhuman other, that is, the other who 
is biologically but not culturally or socially viable as a certain kind of human.",1
Posthuman_Ethics,hasCriticism,"It

do inspire Posthuman Ethics would be any better should they be interrogated

vided by Edouard Glissant (1997), whose work on colonial-
ism and literature re-frames the horrors of modernity in 
an afﬁ rmative manner, starting from the world-historical

PostAnthropocentrism,hasCriticism,"As Dirk Baecker puts it, second-­order 
systems theory “may well be read as an attempt to do away with any 
usual notion of system, the theory in a way being the deconstruction 
of its central term.”21 Moreover, it is also worth remembering Derrida’s 
suggestion in his late essay “The Animal That Therefore I Am (More 
to Follow)” that perhaps the deepest logic of his investigation of “the 
question of the animal” is in fact “viral,” in the specific sense of a muta-
tional logic of the trace structure of any notational form, any semiotic 
system, that exceeds and encompasses the boundary not just between 
human and animal but also between the living or organic and the me-
chanical or technical—­a contention I take up in some detail in chapters 1 
and 2.22 And it is precisely at this juncture that this book weaves 
together the two different senses of posthumanism that remained 
separate in my previous two books, Critical Environments and Animal 
Rites: posthumanism as a mode of thought in the first book (explored
xix
introduction
there on the parallel terrains of pragmatism, systems theory, and post-
structuralism) and, in the second, posthumanism as engaging directly 
the problem of anthropocentrism and speciesism and how practices of 
thinking and reading must change in light of their critique.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasCriticism,"Conclusion
In this chapter I have pursued a dual aim: I provided an 
answer to the question of what the posthuman might be in a 
post-anthropocentric perspective and argued the case for a 
posthuman theory that takes into account subjectivity. The most serious political problems in post-anthropocen-
tric theory arise from the instrumental alliance of bio-genetic 
capitalism with individualism, as a residual humanist deﬁ ni-
tion of the subject.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasCriticism,"There is another fundamental problem with the residual 
humanism of the analytically posthuman attempts to moral-
ize technology and sideline experiments with new forms of 
subjectivity, namely their over-conﬁ dence about the moral 
intentionality of the technology itself. More speciﬁ cally, they 
neglect the current state of autonomy reached by the machines. The complexity of our smart technologies lies at the core of 
the post-anthropocentric turn that will be the theme of the 
next chapter.",1

PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"84-98 
specific period of American history enables an interpretation of the novel 
in the context of the Anthropocene and a distinctly self-conscious 
Eurocentric anthropocentrism. This anthropocentrism derives from a 
desire to preserve and strictly regulate a human identity in order to 
maintain social cohesion for a new economic project that intends to 
recapture that Eurocentrism.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"A post-anthropocentric approach makes 
it clear that bodily matter in the human as in other species is 
always already sexed and hence sexually differentiated along 
the axes of multiplicity and heterogeneity. I have argued that matter-realist or posthuman vitalist 
feminism, resting on a dynamic monistic political ontology, 
shifts the focus away from the sex/gender distinction, bring-
ing sexuality as process into full focus.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"A posthuman 
subject thus constituted exceeds the boundaries of both 
anthropocentrism and of compensatory humanism, to acquire 
a planetary dimension. The Posthuman as Becoming-machine
The issue of technology is central to the post-anthropocentric 
predicament and it has already come out several times in the 
previous sections. The relationship between the human and 
the technological other has shifted in the contemporary 
context, to reach unprecedented degrees of intimacy and 
intrusion.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"An idea that may be considered is that instead 
of technology causing human trauma, we are now the ones who traumatise technology. What if technology, in the form of computers and robots, has evolved to the point where 
it possesses the ability to become traumatised? This trajectory of thought is one that 
ought to be considered in an attempt to debunk anthropocentrism and to investigate and

PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"And my point here will be 
not to pursue a kind of “more-­posthumanist-­than-­thou” sweepstakes 
but to bring out in a detailed way how the admirable impulses be-
hind any variety of philosophy that challenges anthropocentrism and 
speciesism—­impulses that I respect wherever they may be found—­
demand a certain reconfiguration of what philosophy (or “theory”) is 
and how it can (and cannot) respond to the challenge that all the phi-
losophers discussed here want to engage: the challenge of sharing the 
planet with nonhuman subjects and treating them justly.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"Anthropocentrism always already contains the conditions of its
 own transcendence.28 Its structure, to use Derrida's words, ""bears
 within itself the necessity of its own critique"" (1978, ""Structure,"" 284);
 its inside turns itself inside out. I think that the trick-and this would
 certainly not be what Haraway calls a ""god trick"" (1991, 189)-is to
 learn what the characters who experience the strange building in
 Mark Z.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"As I will argue more extensively in chapter 4, this discus-
sion reopens the question of the relationship between the two 
cultures, the Humanities and Science. My point is that the 
social studies of science (Latour, 1993) are not the only, or
Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species  
even the most useful, tools of analysis for the complex phe-
nomena surrounding the postanthropocentric technobodies 
of advanced capitalism. Let me get to this from another angle.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"As we 
saw in chapter 1, the latter is expected to inhabit a perfectly 
functional physical body, implicitly modelled upon ideals of

white masculinity, normality, youth and health. The dialectics 
of otherness is the inner engine of humanist Man’s power, 
who assigns difference on a hierarchical scale as a tool of 
governance.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"At the dawn of the third millennium, in a 
world caught in indeﬁ nite and technologically mediated 
warfare, such metaphorical grandeur rings rather hollow. Post-anthropocentrism rather suggests the opposite: no 
animal is more equal than any other, because they are all 
equally inscribed in a market economy of planetary exchanges 
that commodiﬁ es them to a comparable degree and therefore 
makes them equally disposable. All other distinctions are 
blurred.",1

were being launched into orbit as part of the budding space 
exploration programmes and escalating competition between

shared identity, they are not displacing anthropocentrism but are 
instead offering another iteration of it” (26).",1

enormous and compelling project Dead Meat—­a compilation of draw-

the United States and abroad—­I try to show how art that is dedicated 
to exposing the horrors of anthropocentrism and the violence toward 
animals that it countenances may nevertheless be, in its very strategies 
and despite itself, humanist and anthropocentric.",1

Posthuman Humanities: 
Life beyond Theory
How could the Humanities fail to be affected by the posthu-
man condition? The dislocations of the discursive boundaries 
and categorical differences triggered respectively by the explo-
sion of humanism and the implosion of anthropocentrism 
causes an internal fracture within the Humanities that cannot 
be mended just by goodwill. Let us assess the damage on 
the basis of the analyses I provided in the three previous 
chapters.",1

this fundamental shift in the ironical cartoons that depict 
companion species in the Vitruvian pose (see ﬁ gures 2.2 and

PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"For instance: once these post-anthropocentric practices 
blur the qualitative lines of demarcation not only among 
categories (male/female, black/white, human/animal, dead/
alive, centre/margin, etc.), but also within each one of them, 
the human becomes subsumed into global networks of control 
and commodiﬁ cation which have taken ‘Life’ as the main 
target. The generic ﬁ gure of the human is consequently in 
trouble.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"For one thing, whereas

ﬂ aws to be fatal for the ﬁ eld, which was deemed unsuitable 
for contemporary science and hence not eligible for ﬁ nancial 
support by the relevant Ministry and the government.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"I have argued for the need 
to re-cast the life–death distinction in terms of a vital con-
tinuum based on internal differentiations. I presented it as the 
double overturning ﬁ rstly of individualism, in favour of 
complex singularities, and secondly of anthropocentrism, in 
favour of multiplicities of non-human ﬂ ows and assemblages.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"I propose to reinscribe posthuman bodies into radical 
relationality, including webs of power relations at the social, 
psychic, ecological and micro-biological or cellular levels. The post-anthropocentrism of our science and our globalized

towards ‘a new techno-scientiﬁ c democracy’ (Haraway, 1997:

 easily become ""false exits,"" as the ""force and the efficiency"" of tradi-
 tion effect a stricter and more naive reinstatement of ""the new terrain
 on the oldest ground"" (135).",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"In mainstream 
public debates, for instance, the posthuman is usually coated 
in anxiety about the excesses of technological intervention 
and the threat of climate change, or by elation about the 
potential for human enhancement. In academic culture, on 
the other hand, the critique of anthropocentrism has even 
more shattering implications than the transformative agenda 
of posthumanism which I analysed in the previous chapter.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"In opposition to classical, linear 
teleological ideas of evolution (Chardin de Teillard, 1959), I 
want to emphasize instead the collective project of seeking a 
more adequate understanding of the complexity of factors 
that structure the posthuman subject: the new proximity to 
animals, the planetary dimension and the high level of tech-
nological mediation. Machinic autopoiesis means that the 
technological is a site of post-anthropocentric becoming, or 
the threshold to many possible worlds.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"In opposition to the nostalgic trend that is so dominant in 
contemporary politics, but also opposing a tendency to mel-
ancholia on the part of the progressive Left (Derrida, 2001b; 
Butler, 2004a; Gilroy, 2005), I want to argue that the posthu-
man emphasis on life/zoe itself can engender afﬁ rmative poli-
Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species 
tics. Critical post-anthropocentrism generates new perspectives 
that go beyond panic and mourning and produce a more 
workable platform.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"In so far as advanced capitalism markets 
and proﬁ ts from the bio-genetic structures of life itself, it 
contributes to the displacement of anthropocentrism. Animals 
are caught in a double bind: on the one hand, they are more 
than ever the object of inhumane exploitation; on the other 
hand, they beneﬁ t from residual forms of reparative human-
ization. This conﬂ icting situation leads me to conclude that 
post-anthropocentrism is for both humans and animals a 
mixed blessing.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"In the Freudian sense of the 
word fetish, animal life becomes a substitute mediating the affirmation of 
anthropocentrism and bourgeois, patriarchal values. Abortion is an 
offence punishable by death, and there exists a class of people officially 
known as ‘special’, within which there are subcategories of intellectual 
disability pejoratively referred to as ‘chickenheads’ and ‘antheads’, 
(Isidore himself is a chickenhead).",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"In the political economy of phallogocentrism and of
Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species  
anthropocentric humanism, which predicates the sovereignty 
of Sameness in a falsely universalistic mode, my sex fell on 
the side of ‘Otherness’, understood as pejorative difference, 
or as being-worth-less-than.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"In the ﬁ eld of bio-ethics, for instance, the issue 
of the ‘human’ rights of animals has been raised as a way of 
countering these excesses. The defence of animals’ rights is a 
hot political issue in most liberal democracies. This combina-
tion of investments and abuse is the paradoxical posthuman 
condition engendered by advanced capitalism itself, which trig-
gers multiple forms of resistance. I will discuss the new post-
anthropocentric views of animals at length in chapter 2.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"It also tends to be deeply inhuman(e), as we shall 
see in the next chapter. The posthuman dimension of post-
anthropocentrism can consequently be seen as a deconstruc-
tive move. What it deconstructs is species supremacy, but it 
also inﬂ icts a blow to any lingering notion of human nature, 
anthropos and bios, as categorically distinct from the life of 
animals and non-humans, or zoe.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"It complements the destabilization of anthropocentrism 
brought about by the increasingly sophisticated androids, in a manner 
eluding the techniques of android policing. It is telling that this most acute 
description of Kipple’s effect comes from Isidore immediately after he 
turns off the TV screaming the advertisement for androids. Kipple is, in 
fact, the reason Isidore turns on the TV in the first place.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"It helps us rethink 
transversal technologically mediated subjectivity while avoid-
ing scientiﬁ c reductionism. In his critique of the rhetoric of 
bio-technological vitalism (1997), Ansell Pearson warns us 
against the pernicious fantasy of a renaturalized notion of 
evolution mediated by advanced bio-technological capital-
ism. I think that the point of the posthuman predicament is 
to rethink evolution in a non-deterministic but also a post-
anthropocentric manner.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"It is a transformative or symbiotic relation that hybridizes 
and alters the ‘nature’ of each one and foregrounds the middle 
grounds of their interaction. This is the ‘milieu’ of the human/
Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species 
non-human continuum and it needs to be explored as an open 
experiment, not as a foregone moral conclusion about alleg-
edly universal values or qualities.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"It is also an afﬁ rmative reaction of 
social and cultural theory to the great advances made by the 
other culture, that of the sciences. The relationship between 
the two will be addressed in chapter 4. Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species  
A posthuman theory of the subject emerges, therefore, as 
an empirical project that aims at experimenting with what 
contemporary, bio-technologically mediated bodies are 
capable of doing.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"It is as socially constructed as most 
humans, not only through genetic screening, but also via 
health and hygiene regulations and various grooming prac-
tices. Who has not struggled to suppress a giggle of recogni-
tion at the news of the success of pets’ diet clinics in the 
glamorous suburbs of LA? Some surprising forms of material 
equivalence are found among different life-forms in these
Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species 
posthuman days.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"It is the transversal force that 
cuts across and reconnects previously segregated species, cat-
egories and domains. Zoe-centred egalitarianism is, for me, 
the core of the post-anthropocentric turn: it is a materialist, 
secular, grounded and unsentimental response to the oppor-
tunistic trans-species commodiﬁ cation of Life that is the logic 
of advanced capitalism.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"It may be worth taking seriously the critical 
charge that the Humanities’ development towards complexity 
may be hampered by the anthropocentrism that underscores 
their practice. Will critical theory be able to connect to rich 
and complex post-Humanities to come?",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"It strikes instead an alliance with the 
productive and immanent force of zoe, or life in its non-
human aspects. This requires a mutation of our shared under-
standing of what it means to think at all, let alone think 
critically. In the rest of this chapter I will develop this insight into a 
number of interrelated ﬁ elds of post-anthropocentric enquiry.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"Jackie 
Stacey, in her analysis of the new organic food industry 
(Franklin et al., 2000) argues that we literally eat the global 
economy. Paul Gilroy (2000) and Celia Lury (1998) remind 
us that we also wear it, listen to it and watch it on our many 
screens, on a daily basis. Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species  
The global circulation of goods, data, capital, bits and 
bytes of information frames the interaction of contemporary 
subjects on a daily basis.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"Linked to this is 
the deplorable persistence of an introverted culture of disciplin-
ary insularity, unthinking Eurocentrism and anthropocentrism. Few of these institutional habits of the Humanities are really 
conducive to epistemological self-scrutiny. The ﬁ eld further-
more tends to be unable to resist the fatal attraction of the 
gravitational pull back to Humanism. Only a serious mutation 
can therefore help the Humanities to grow out of some of their 
entrenched bad habits.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"Living matter – including the ﬂ esh – is intelligent and self-
organizing, but it is so precisely because it is not disconnected 
from the rest of organic life. I therefore do not work com-
pletely within the social constructivist method but rather 
emphasize the non-human, vital force of Life, which is what 
I have coded as zoe. Post-anthropocentrism is marked by the emergence of ‘the 
politics of life itself’ (Rose, 2007).",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"Monism 
results in relocating difference outside the dialectical scheme, 
as a complex process of differing which is framed by both 
internal and external forces and is based on the centrality of 
the relation to multiple others. These monistic premises are for me the building blocks for 
a posthuman theory of subjectivity that does not rely on clas-
sical Humanism and carefully avoids anthropocentrism.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"My argument is that, again, this change 
of perspective is rich in alternatives for a renewal of subjectiv-
ity. What would a geo-centred subject look like? 5 This is the title of the on-line book series that Colebrook edits for 
the Open Humanities Press. Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species 
The starting point for me remains the nature–culture con-
tinuum, but by now we need to insert into this framework 
the monistic insight that, as Lloyd put it, we are all ‘part of 
nature’ (1994).",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"On the basis of rigorous 
empirical observation of the great apes, de Waal transformed
Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species 
our thinking about evolution and evolutionary psychology by 
challenging the emphasis on aggression as the motor of 
species development.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"On the contrary, on a world scale, extreme 
forms of polarized sexual difference are stronger than ever. They get projected onto geo-political relations, creating bel-
Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species 
ligerent gendered visions of a ‘clash of civilizations’ that is 
allegedly predicated in terms of women’s and GLBT people’s 
rights, as I argued in the previous chapter. These reactionary 
manifestations of gender dichotomies are only part of the 
picture.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"On the methodological front, de-familiarization shifts 
the relationship to the nonhuman others and requires dis-
identiﬁ cation from century-old habits of anthropocentric 
thought and humanist arrogance, which is likely to test the 
ability and willingness of the Humanities. The ‘hard’ or 
experimental sciences, of course, are accomplishing this move 
away from anthropocentrism with relative ease, as we saw 
in the case of the Deep History or the One Health research 
movements.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"Once the centrality of anthropos is challenged, a number 
of boundaries between ‘Man’ and his others go tumbling

down, in a cascade effect that opens up unexpected perspec-
tives.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"One of the risks of the ‘hype’ that surrounds the post-
anthropocentric body-machines is indeed that of recreating a
Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species 
hard core, unitary vision of the subject, under the cover of 
pluralistic fragmentation. We run the risk of reasserting tran-
scendence via technological meditation and of proposing a 
neo-universal machinic ethos.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"Other critical theories come closer 
to the target, notably feminist, environmentalist and race 
theorists who have addressed the shifting status of embodi-
ment and difference in advanced capitalism in a manner that 
reﬂ ects the complexity of global social relations.3

power and contemporary posthuman structures has to do 
with the dis-placement of anthropocentrism.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species  
The key notion is the transversality of relations, for a 
postanthropocentric and posthuman subject that traces trans-
versal connections among material and symbolic, concrete 
and discursive lines of relation or forces. Transversality actu-

Deleuze and Guattari, allows us to by-pass the pitfalls of 
binary thinking and to address the environmental question in 
its full complexity.",1

posthuman recomposition of human interaction that I propose 
is not the same as the reactive bond of vulnerability, but 
is an afﬁ rmative bond that locates the subject in the ﬂ ow of

sary link between critical posthumanism and the move beyond 
anthropocentrism. I refer to this move as expanding the 
notion of Life towards the non-human or zoe.",1

Post-anthropocentrism displaces the notion of species hierar-

PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"The paradox of afﬁ rming life as potentia, energy, even in 
and through the suppression of the speciﬁ c slice of life that 
‘I’ inhabit is a way of pushing both post-humanism and post-
anthropocentrism to the point of implosion. It dissolves death 
into ever-shifting processual changes, and thus disintegrates 
the ego, with its capital of narcissism, paranoia and negativ-
ity. Death as process from the speciﬁ c and highly restricted 
viewpoint of the ego is of no signiﬁ cance whatsoever.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"The post-anthropocentric turn, linked to the compounded 
impacts of globalization and of technology-driven forms of 
mediation, strikes the human at his/her heart and shifts the

man in relation to post-anthropocentrism is of an altogether 
different order than in post-humanism.",1

gency and to the emergence of the earth as a political agent.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"The status and the location of Humanism, which was the 
theme of the previous chapter, are central to this discussion 
of post-anthropocentrism. I tend to resist the political neu-
trality of critical, social and science theorists who support 
an analytic form of post-anthropocentrism and avoid or 
dismiss the question of subjectivity.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"This critique of anthropocentrism is expressed in the name 
of ecological awareness, with strong emphasis on the experi-
ence of social minorities like women and of non-Western 
peoples. The recognition of multicultural perspectives and the 
critique of imperialism and ethnocentrism add a crucial aspect 
to the discussion on the becoming-earth, but nowadays they 
also fall in their own internal contradictions. Let us take, for instance, the case of ‘deep ecology’.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"This high degree of 
trans-disciplinarity alone adds an extra layer of complexity 
to the issue. The key question for me is: what understandings 
of contemporary subjectivity and subject-formation are 
enabled by a post-anthropocentric approach? What comes 
after the anthropocentric subject? How one reacts to this change of perspective depends to 
a large extent on one’s relationship to technology. Being 
rather technophilic myself, I am quite upbeat.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"This idolatry of the natural order 
is linked to Spinoza’s vision of God and the unity between 
man and nature. It stresses the harmony between the human 
and the ecological habitat in order to propose a sort of syn-
Post-Anthropocentrism: Life beyond the Species 
thesis of the two. Deep ecology is therefore spiritually charged 
in an essentialist way. Because there are no boundaries and 
everything is interrelated, to hurt nature is ultimately to hurt 
ourselves.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"This is a new and inno-
vative agenda, which builds on but is not conﬁ ned to either 
humanism or anthropocentrism – a genuinely new programme 
for the Humanities in the twentieth century.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"This is the ‘we’ that 
is evoked and actualized by the postanthropocentric creation 
of a new pan-humanity. It expresses the afﬁ rmative, ethical

PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"This means that it opposes the earth to industrializa-

tion, nature to culture, the environment to society and comes 
down ﬁ rmly on the side of the natural order. This results in 
a relevant political agenda that is critical of consumerism and

technocratic reason and technological culture. But this

political economy of bio-genetic capitalism induces, if not the 
actual erasure, at least the blurring of the distinction between 
the human and other species when it comes to proﬁ ting from 
them.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"This post-anthropocentric approach requires more efforts 
of our imagination to ground our representations in real-life

conditions and in an afﬁ rmative manner. In this respect, we 
need to rethink dogs, cats and other sofa-based companions 
today as cutting across species partitions not only affectively, 
but also organically, so to speak.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"This proliferation of discourses 
is both a threat and an opportunity in that it requires method-
ological innovations, such as a critical genealogical approach 
that by-passes the mere rhetoric of the crisis. The fallout of post-anthropocentrism, which I outlined in 
chapter 2, sets a different agenda for the Humanities, and not 
only in terms of research priorities.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"This way resists commodification in our

PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"This zoe-driven 
subject is marked by the interdependence with its envi-

PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"Undeniably, the vitalist egalitari-
anism of zoe is likely to attract those who have become dis-
enchanted with and disengaged from the anthropocentrism 
that is built into humanistic thought, even in what is left of 
the political Left, of feminism and post-colonial theory. I live 
at the tail end of bio-power, that is to say amidst the relentless 
necro-political consumption of all that lives.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"Vitalist materialism is a concept that helps us 
make sense of that external dimension, which in fact enfolds 
within the subject as the internalized score of cosmic vibra-

constitutes the core of a posthuman sensibility that aims at 
overcoming anthropocentrism. Let me spell out some of these rather dense ideas.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"We also need to reassess the generative powers of 
female embodiment. In this vision, gender is just a historically 
contingent mechanism of capture of the multiple potentiali-
ties of the body, including their generative or reproductive 
capacities. To turn it into the transhistorical matrix of power, 
as suggested by queer theory in the linguistic and social con-
structivist tradition (Butler, 1991), is quite simply a concep-

tual error.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"We may now, then—­to move toward a conclusion—­suggest a 
more overarching schema in which such a procedure might be called 
“humanist posthumanism,” locating itself at one corner of a plane, in 
which the Y axis denotes external relations (–/+ humanism/anthropo-
centrism) and the X axis denotes internal disciplinarity (–/+ humanism/
anthropocentrism).",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasDefinition,"When the body is fractured into 
functional parts and molecular codes, where is gender 
located?’ Let us trust women, gays, lesbians and other alter-

the key criteria.",1
PostAnthropocentrism,hasExample,"Derrida referred to 
the power of the human species over animals in terms of 
‘carno-phallogocentrism’ (Derrida, 2006) and criticized it as 
an example of epistemic and material violence. In their com-

analysis of the limits of the Enlightenment project. Derrida’s

PostAnthropocentrism,hasExample,"For example, just because a historian devotes attention to the topic 
of nonhuman animals—­let’s say, the awful plight of horses used in com-
bat operations during World War I—­doesn’t mean that humanism and 
anthropocentrism aren’t being maintained and reproduced in his or her 
disciplinary practice insofar as the disciplinary subject doing the history 
remains isolated from the “viral” effects of the second form of finitude,

very promising for new research in the ﬁ eld. Probably the

the post-anthropocentric Humanities is the recent explosion 
of scholarship in the ﬁ elds of ‘Animal Studies’ and of ‘Eco-

that technologically mediated post-anthropocentrism can 
enlist the resources of bio-genetic codes, as well as telecom-

approach is supported and expanded today by new develop-

Posthumanism,hasCriticism,"As Dirk Baecker puts it, second-­order 
systems theory “may well be read as an attempt to do away with any 
usual notion of system, the theory in a way being the deconstruction 
of its central term.”21 Moreover, it is also worth remembering Derrida’s 
suggestion in his late essay “The Animal That Therefore I Am (More 
to Follow)” that perhaps the deepest logic of his investigation of “the 
question of the animal” is in fact “viral,” in the specific sense of a muta-
tional logic of the trace structure of any notational form, any semiotic 
system, that exceeds and encompasses the boundary not just between 
human and animal but also between the living or organic and the me-
chanical or technical—­a contention I take up in some detail in chapters 1 
and 2.22 And it is precisely at this juncture that this book weaves 
together the two different senses of posthumanism that remained 
separate in my previous two books, Critical Environments and Animal 
Rites: posthumanism as a mode of thought in the first book (explored
xix
introduction
there on the parallel terrains of pragmatism, systems theory, and post-
structuralism) and, in the second, posthumanism as engaging directly 
the problem of anthropocentrism and speciesism and how practices of 
thinking and reading must change in light of their critique.",1
Posthumanism,hasCriticism,"BOTH SIDES NOW, OR WHY E.T. WANTED TO GO HOME
 I chose to begin the introduction to my book on posthumanism with
 a reference to an image from the cover of Time that I have since real-
 ized raises the problem of human(ist) remains (Badmington 2000,
 ""Introduction,"" 1). The issue in question dates from the first week
 of January 1983 when, according to the Time-honored tradition, the
 magazine was expected to announce its ""Man of the Year."" There was,
 however, something strange about the winner.",1
Posthumanism,hasCriticism,"Benhabib takes three elements
of post-modern thought (roughly translatable into posthumanism) as problematic
when formulating a feminist ethics for selfhood, which resonate with posthuman
philosophies within an explicitly feminist context due to their address to the most
emphatic of all isomorphic dominant terms, man. These are the death of the sub-
ject, what she calls The Death of Man, the excavation of the truth of history or
P.",1
Posthumanism,hasCriticism,"Critical 
posthuman thought wants to re-assemble a discursive com-
munity out of the different, fragmented contemporary strands 
of posthumanism. I cannot help noticing, moreover, a rather bizarre and 
highly problematic division of labour on the question of 
subjectivity between science and technology studies on the
Post-Humanism: Life beyond the Self  
one hand, and political analyses of advanced capitalism on 
the other.",1
Posthumanism,hasCriticism,"The vir-
tue of paying attention to the thinkers I have been discussing is not 
only do they make it clear that disciplines aren’t persons; they also 
make it clear that persons aren’t persons, in the sense of the definition of 
“person” that humanism “gives to itself.” And it is here, at this precise 
juncture, that animal studies becomes a subset of the larger problem-
atic of posthumanism.",1
Posthumanism,hasCriticism,"What remains to haunt the book, however,
 is the possibility that humanism will haunt or taint posthumanism,
 and it is precisely this problem that will concern me here-a problem
 of what remains, a problem of remains.4 If Hayles's project is to imag-
 ine a posthumanism that does not fall into the kind of trap that
 ensnares Moravec, mine is slightly different (though not unrelated),
 involving instead an attention to what of humanism itself persists,
 insists, and ultimately desists.5 I want, in short, to ask an apparently
 straightforward question, with deliberately Leninist overtones: if
 traces of humanism find their way into even the most apocalyptic
 accounts of the posthumanist condition, what is to be done?",1

Posthuman Ethics
To see the natural world, the extra-human world which we colonize with human 
siJnifiFation and oFFuS\ with deYastatinJ effeFts, as antaJonistiF to the huPan 
world performs a beautiful dance, just as Serres sees the philosophy of grace a 
dance. Posthumanism directs a challenge to tenets of deconstructive elements 
of poststructuralism, the zenith of which is Derrida’s maxim ‘There is nothing 
outside the text’.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"(2010), a text now considered to be an important
forerunner of the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of ‘posthumanities’, Wolfe argues
that one of his fundamental aims is to rework the ‘ontologically closed
domain’ of attributes thought to be uniquely human (2010: xxv). He
champions the cause for a ‘trans-species empathy’ that will recognize
the human as a human animal whose deﬁning characteristics are not so
much exceptional as they are of a ‘generalized animal sensorium’ (Wolfe,
2010: 134).",1

Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Along with
 Sterlings Schismatrix and Tepper's Family
 Tree, therefore, Oshii's film comes closest
 among the works here discussed to suggest
 ing a posthumanist perspective, in which hu
 man consciousness is not a priori set apart
 as unique.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Amending the history of the excesses of indescribable violence perpetrated on 
nonhumans comes as a step toward posthuman becomings, elucidating the 
detrimental effects of human discourse and thus the urgent need to forsake it and 
the powers which it affords. It is perhaps the why that catalyses posthumanism 
without FonFreti]inJ JeneaOoJ\ or oriJin that SrediFts future or finitude.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"And it is precisely
 this elaborate, laborious, labyrinthine rewriting that Lyotard names
 postmodernity. I want to borrow Lyotard's borrowing, to carry it-along with the
 work of Derrida-to the space of posthumanism.31 Both thinkers, it
 seems to me, invite a careful (re)consideration of the signifier in ques-
 tion. From a perspective informed by their thought, the ""post-"" of
 posthumanism does not (and, moreover, cannot) mark or make an
 absolute break from the legacy of humanism.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"And that leaves posthumanist posthumanism, 
which has to do with understanding—­and understanding the conse-
quences of—­the very redefinition of what humanistic knowledge is 
after the disciplinary subjectivity at its core, the notion of the human 
that it “gives to itself,” has been rewritten along the lines I have been 
exploring here in the work of Derrida and Luhmann (and elsewhere in 
the work of Deleuze and Guattari, Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, and 
Maturana and Varela).",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Another option becomes increasingly desirable and necessary: 
posthumanism as a move beyond these lethal binaries. Let us 
turn to it next. The Posthuman Challenge
Posthumanism is the historical moment that marks the end 
of the opposition between Humanism and anti-humanism 
and traces a different discursive framework, looking more 
afﬁ rmatively towards new alternatives.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Apocalyptic accounts
 of the end of ""Man,"" it seems to me, ignore humanism's capacity for

it, Dancer in the Dark’s relationship to posthumanism is not just thematic 
(in the relationship between Selma’s encroaching blindness and how it 
reconfigures the sight/sound relationship for the human) but also op-
erational in its handling of the medium of film itself.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"As a prominent ﬁgure in posthumanist theory and the emergent ﬁeld
of ‘interdisciplinary animal studies’, Cary Wolfe’s work serves as an
exemplary version of arguments that are persuaded by the prospect of
a posthumanist ethics, one which will cut across species barriers and, in
that respect, mobilize a fundamental shift in our understanding of dis-
criminatory practices and moral responsibility.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"As for the first (as I have already suggested on the heels of 
Marjorie Levinson’s useful distinction between “new historicism” and 
“new historicism”), the distinction humanism/posthumanism is com-
pletely asymmetrical, in fact, to the distinction historicism/formalism.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"As for the second point—­that posthumanism is anti-­ or post­
human—­my sense of posthumanism does not partake of the fantasy of 
the posthuman described by N.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Because of this resonance 
between the two dimensions, critical theory has a unique 
contribution to make to the debate on Europe. I believe that the posthuman condition can facilitate the 
task of redeﬁ ning a new role for Europe in an age where 
global capitalism is both triumphant and clearly deﬁ cient in

Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Both
 halves of the signifier in question demand attention: posthumanism,
 as I have argued elsewhere, is as much posthumanist as it is post-
 humanist (2001, 13).19
 This should not be read as a regressive or reactionary gesture. To
 engage with humanism, to acknowledge its persistence, is not neces-
 sarily to support humanism.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"But he understands them spe-
cifically within a posthumanist context: that is to say, as expressions 
not of a psychological or emotional interiority or intentionality that 
reveals itself in language (even if only to gesture toward language’s 
inadequacy in the face of the “ineffable”) but as expressions of a set 
of differences—­most importantly, the difference between communi-
cation and perception, which in poetry are “miraculously” made to 
coincide (as he puts it) when the material form of the signifier seems to 
duplicate the semantics of communication (in familiar devices such as 
rhyme, rhythm, and so on).",1

Introduction  What Is Posthumanism?",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Fundamentally, the critical leverage in the
use of the preﬁx ‘post’ rests on the belief that the discrimination between

the human and the nonhuman is more given than interrogated. In other
words, posthumanism calls into question the apparently obvious coher-
ence of ‘human nature’, and aims to destabilize the basic premises of
human exceptionalism, i.e.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Humanists 
endorse universal morality based on the commonality of the human 
condition, suggesting that solutions to human social and cultural prob-
lems cannot be parochial. Posthumanism, on the other hand, generates different and even irrec-
oncilable definitions.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"I certainly do not want to suggest that ""we"" stop reading
 books like Simians, Cyborgs, and Women (Haraway 1991), How We
 Became Posthuman (Hayles 1999), Cyborg Citizen (Gray 2001), and Rep-
 resentations of the Post/Human (Graham 2002). I do, however, want to
 bring Derrida into the picture, to theorize posthumanism from a posi-
 tion made possible by his work.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"I see three major strands in contemporary posthuman 
thought: the ﬁ rst comes from moral philosophy and develops 
a reactive form of the posthuman; the second, from science and 
technology studies, enforces an analytic form of the posthu-
man; and the third, from my own tradition of anti-humanist 
philosophies of subjectivity, proposes a critical post-humanism. Let us look at each of these in turn.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"I think that Derrida's reluctance to be seduced by the ""apocalyp-
 tic tone"" bears repeating today, as posthumanism begins to find its
 feet within the academy.16 It seems to me that many are a little too
 quick to affirm an absolute break with humanism, and a little too
 reluctant to attend to what remains of humanism in the posthuman-
 ist landscape.17 From one perspective, this is perfectly understand-
 able: posthumans are far more exciting, far sexier than humans.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"If desire and sexuality are the jubilant loci for posthumanism which addresses
feminist concerns, then they are also the loci for fear for the majoritarian.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"If the version of posthumanism that I am trying to
 develop here repeats humanism, it does so in a certain way and with a
 view to the deconstruction of anthropocentric thought.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"If this were the technique of 
posthumanism it would simply constitute a reverse of dragging nonhumans up 
to human level to be viable. Any thinking of nonhuman entities in posthuman 
theory (a clear trend in current posthuman publications) fails the very premise of 
its ambition, no matter how amorphous or experimental.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"If,
 to invoke Celan, there are still songs to be sung beyond the human,
 posthumanism marks the recognition that humanism, always already
 in disharmony with itself, forever sounds of other airs, other heirs.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"In fact, this 
question will be handled in different and even opposed ways by Singer, 
Nussbaum, Diamond, and finally Derrida—­differences that will be de-
finitive for understanding the difference between what I am calling 
humanist and posthumanist approaches to the question of nonhuman 
(and human) animal life.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"In her repeated insistence that “I’ve seen all I 
need to see,” the film registers the fact that “the subject’s division is not 
the division between one Self and another, between two contents, but 
the division between something and nothing, between the feature of identi-
fication and the void.”27 In this light, we can understand Selma’s rigor-
ous insistence that further identifications (“seeing more” in the song’s 
terms) will change nothing as a kind of unflinching posthumanism—­a 
point punctuated, one might say, as Selma removes her glasses at the 
beginning of the number and tosses them into the water, then mo-
ments later wraps her arms around herself and falls to the ground in a 
fetal position, dangerously (suicidally?) near the passing train, as a final 
“answer” to Jeff’s repeated calls for further, other identifications with 
the roles of wife, grandmother, and so on made available to her.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"In mainstream 
public debates, for instance, the posthuman is usually coated 
in anxiety about the excesses of technological intervention 
and the threat of climate change, or by elation about the 
potential for human enhancement. In academic culture, on 
the other hand, the critique of anthropocentrism has even 
more shattering implications than the transformative agenda 
of posthumanism which I analysed in the previous chapter.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"In so far as art stretches the boundaries of 
representation to the utmost, it reaches the limits of life itself 
and thus confronts the horizon of death. To this effect, art is 
linked to death as the experience of limits (Blanchot, 2000). The Inhuman: Life beyond Death 
I will return to this point later on in the chapter, in my discus-
sion of a posthuman philosophy of death.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"In the opening pages of What is
Posthumanism?, Wolfe writes:
[T]he perspective I attempt to formulate here – far from surpassing
or rejecting the human – actually enables us to describe the human
and its characteristic modes of communication, interaction, mean-
ing, social signiﬁcations, and aﬀective investments with greater spe-
ciﬁcity once we have removed meaning from the ontologically
Chiew
closed domain of consciousness, reason, reﬂection, and so on.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"In this respect, my sense of posthumanism is the 
opposite of transhumanism, and in this light, transhumanism should 
be seen as an intensification of humanism. Indeed, one well-­known fig-
ure associated with transhumanism, Hans Moravec, draws Hayles’s ire 
for precisely this reason.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Indeed, in an eventual discussion of feminist
and physicist Karen Barad’s work, I suggest that the implications of
Wolfe’s thesis of ‘trans-species aﬃnity’ can be extended still further. Wolfe’s brand of posthumanism is both ambitious and unusual as it
brings together very disparate areas of thought.",1

Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Insofar as posthumanism shows the very 
questions themselves demand answers, the polyvocality the questions presume is 
inherent in posthuman’s multiplicities and proliferative affects. The death of the 
author/artist and the ensuing death of the reader can lead to a non-nihilistic vitalism 
that maintains an ethical non-subject.",1

human and nonhuman’ (2010: 127). In What is Posthumanism?",1

from a base outside Las Vegas.3
Although world media focused on the brutality of the 
actual shooting and on the indignity of the global visual 
exposure of Gaddaﬁ ’s wounded and bleeding body, less atten-
tion was paid to what can only described as the posthuman 
aspect of contemporary warfare: the tele-thanatological 
machines created by our own advanced technology.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"It 
is not just, as Neil Badmington and others have rightly observed, that 
“the ‘post-­’ of posthumanism does not (and, moreover, cannot) mark or 
make an absolute break from the legacy of humanism.”45 It also means 
that while we may share Hayles’s view that various visions and versions 
of the triumphantly disembodied posthuman, such as Hans Moravec’s, 
continue to rely on (indeed imperialize) “a liberal humanist view of the 
self,”46 we must also recognize that there are liberal humanist ways of 
engaging in this very critique.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"It is perhaps an appropriately posthumanist gesture to begin 
this book with the results of a Google search. As I write (in summer of 
2008), if you Google “humanism,” you’ll be rewarded with 3,840,000 
hits; “posthumanism” yields a mere 60,200. (Apparently humanism is 
alive and well, despite reports of its demise.) You will notice at a cur-
sory glance that despite the discrepancy in numbers there appears to 
be much more unanimity about humanism than posthumanism.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"It is thus also in this precise sense—­the 
sense in which the viral logic articulated here must be extended, as 
Derrida insists, to the “entire field of the living, or rather to the life/death 
relation”33—­that “the animal question” is part of the larger question of 
posthumanism.",1

tional, ethical, and political stakes of this mutational, viral, or parasitic 
form of thinking. As David Wills

The Death of History and the death of the desire to master the self and the world

on what could be called an additional death belonging to the Posthuman
Condition, the death of the discrete episteme in posthumanism, where science
meets philosophy. He sees three key questions central to both science and philoso-
phy become defunct within the posthuman condition: “1. That there will be an
answer. 2.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Maintaining speech within the limits human language compels is the crux of all 
argument. It implies a shared language. Further from the repudiation of animal 
rights based on equivalence which antispeciesism has foregrounded, in order 
to create an ethics of the inevitable shared living with nonhumans, only the 
human can and needs to be deconstructed and the human’s trajectories toward 
posthumanism have nothing to do with other life.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, critics such as 
Neil Badmington and Elaine Graham gravitated toward the term, with 
Badmington’s edited collection Posthumanism (2000) being a notable at-
tempt at consolidation.3 That body of work in the UK (as suggested by 
the title of Badmington’s subsequent book Alien Chic: Posthumanism and 
the Other Within, and by Graham’s Representations of the Post/Human: 
Monsters, Aliens, and Others in Popular Culture) tended toward a sense 
of posthumanism perhaps best glossed (as Badmington rightly

ligious authority—­as ways of learning about the natural world and

Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Michel Foucault famously suggested that ""man"" is a historical construction whose 
era is about to end in The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (N ew 
York: Vintage Books, 1973), a few years earlier than Ihab Hassan's prescient announce-
ment of posthumanism cited in the epigraph to this chapter. Since then, the more radi-
cal idea of the posthuman (as distinct from posthumanism) has appeared at a number 
of places.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"More disturbingly, Wolfe’s claim seems to diagnose a moralism that
runs counter to his overall commitments: vision (abled) equates with the
bad, non-vision (disabled) equates with the good. It is worth highlighting that Wolfe’s inspiration for a posthumanist
conception of ethics comes from German sociologist and systems theorist
Niklas Luhmann.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"My sense of posthumanism is thus analogous to Jean-­François 
Lyotard’s paradoxical rendering of the postmodern: it comes both be-
fore and after humanism: before in the sense that it names the embodi-
ment and embeddedness of the human being in not just its biological but 
also its technological world, the prosthetic coevolution of the human 
animal with the technicity of tools and external archival mechanisms 
(such as language and culture) of which Bernard Stiegler probably re-
mains our most compelling and ambitious theorist—­and all of which 
comes before that historically specific thing called “the human” that 
Foucault’s archaeology excavates.12 But it comes after in the sense that 
posthumanism names a historical moment in which the decentering 
of the human by its imbrication in technical, medical, informatic, and 
economic networks is increasingly impossible to ignore, a historical

­development that points toward the necessity of new theoretical para-
digms (but also thrusts them on us), a new mode of thought that comes 
after the cultural repressions and fantasies, the philosophical protocols 
and evasions, of humanism as a historically specific phenomenon.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Neil Badmington, Alien Chic: Posthumanism and the Other Within (New 
York: Routledge, 2004). Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” formed part of her 
book Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature (New York: Rout-
ledge, 1991) but appeared first as “Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science, Technol-
ogy, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s,” Socialist Review 80 (1985): 65–108. 5.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Nevertheless, the complexity of maintaining such a position is demon-
strated by the diversity of perspectives denoting where the exact locus of
intervention lies: posthumanism, for some, is about troubling the distinc-
tion between humans and nonhuman animals (Wolfe, 2010; Pettman,
2011; Haraway, 2008); for others, posthumanism is about seeing the
technological as an extension of human subjectivity (Hayles, 1999,
2006; Thacker, 2003, Miah, 2008); for still others, posthumanism is
about interrogating humanity’s role in environmental ethics (Morton,
2010; Pickering, 2005).",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Only the most foolish or self-absorbed cultural critic would
 spend time speculating about something that was actually staring
 him or her in the face. ""'Man,""' as Steve Beard confidently puts it,
 ""does not have to be theorized away; the intersection of consumerism
 and techno-culture has already done the job"" (1998, 114). All that was
 solid has melted into air. Posthumanism has finally arrived, and the-
 ory, like ""Man"" ""himself,"" no longer has a place.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Other voices insist that the body 
cannot be left behind, that the specificities of embodiment matter, that 
mind and body are finally the ""unity"" that Maturana insisted on rather than 
two separate entities. Increasingly the question is not whether we will be-
come posthuman, for posthumanity is already here. Rather, the question is 
what kind of posthumans we will be.",1

bodies which are the matter of another way to think posthumanism.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Posthumanism is a perspective that challenges any fixed notion of ‘the human,’ emphasizing how ‘humanity’ has been historically, culturally, and socially constructed. It is grounded in post-humanist, post-anthropocentric, and post-dualistic views, foregrounding hybrid and interrelated modes of existence across human and nonhuman realms.",1

Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Put simply, if, as Fukuyama suggests posthumanism is embraced as 
a power of human freedom (217) then we must ask, what happens if we were not 
Founted as huPan in the first SOaFe""
In one sense Fukuyama’s argument could not be further from post-theory.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Rather, the point I want to emphasize—­and it is 
one obscured by the generic moniker of “studies,” which occludes the 
crucial link between the two forms of finitude we examined a moment 
ago that reside at the heart of animal studies in a uniquely determining 
way—­is that one can engage in a humanist or a posthumanist practice of 
a discipline, and that fact is crucial to what a discipline can contribute 
to the field of animal studies.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Refusing merely to ape the human, it
 becomes a simian simulacrum (a ""simulacrian,"" if you will), a copy
 for which there is no longer an original. Humanism has slipped into
 posthumanism, and the Discourse on the Method has begun to tell a
 story not unlike that of Haraway's Simians, Cyborgs, and Women.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Repetition, that is to say, can be a form of questioning: to restate
 is not always to reinstate. And while there may be a fine line between
 insurrection and resurrection, the risk, I think, must be measured
 against the alternative, for, as Hayles shows so well, there is nothing
 more terrifying than a posthumanism that claims to be terminating
 ""Man"" while actually extending ""his"" term in office.",1

cal representationalism.39
To return, then, to the question of posthumanism, the perspec-
tive I attempt to formulate here—­far from surpassing or rejecting the 
human—­actually enables us to describe the human and its character-

progressively more human types” (Dick, Do 54), show us the limitations of the
Cartesian self. The Cartesian self is clearly not the only way to understand human sub-

to Dick’s own concerns with human and android identity.",1

Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"The posthumanist perspective rests on the 
assumption of the historical decline of Humanism but goes 
further in exploring alternatives, without sinking into the 
rhetoric of the crisis of Man. It works instead towards elabo-
rating alternative ways of conceptualizing the human subject. I will emphasize the priority of the issue of posthuman sub-
jectivity throughout this book.",1

Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"The “post-­”

Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"They have no mutually unbalancing effects” (65).48
From this vantage, then, posthumanism can be defined quite 
specifically as the necessity for any discourse or critical procedure to 
take account of the constitutive (and constitutively paradoxical) nature 
of its own distinctions, forms, and procedures—­and take account of 
them in ways that may be distinguished from the reflection and intro-
spection associated with the critical subject of humanism.",1

 31. Since this essay was written, lain Chambers has published Culture after
 Humanism: History, Culture, Subjectivity (2001), a wonderful book that also works
 with (and through) the theories of Lyotard and Freud in an attempt to rethink the
 relationship between humanism and posthumanism. 32.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"This process is what I mean by ‘post-anthropocentric 
posthumanism’, which I defend throughout this book. It 
involves a radical estrangement from notions like moral ratio-
nality, unitary identity, transcendent consciousness or innate 
and universal moral values. The focus is entirely on the nor-
matively neutral relational structures of both subject forma-
tion and of possible ethical relations.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Throughout his writings,
Wolfe makes sustained attempts to open up the question of subjectivity
beyond species identities, highlighting in many places that by identifying
the presence of language, conscious awareness and complex social behav-
iour in animals, studies in areas as diverse as neuroscience, cognitive
ethology and ﬁeld ecology have troubled any neat distinctions separating
the human from the nonhuman animal (e.g. 2003a, 2003b, 2010). In
What is Posthumanism?",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Throughout the 
1960s and 1970s an activist brand of anti-Humanism was 
developed by the new social movements and the youth cul-
tures of the day: feminism, de-colonization and anti-racism, 
anti-nuclear and paciﬁ st movements. Chronologically linked
Post-Humanism: Life beyond the Self  
the baby-boomers, these social movements produced radical 
political, social theories and new epistemologies.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Thus 
we find ourselves in a strange but inescapable loop, in which our abil-
ity to understand—­more fully and more thickly than humanism—­“the 
human” depends on “posthumanist” theoretical and methodological 
innovations that end up revealing, to paraphrase Lyotard, that the post-
human comes both after (chronologically) and before (as its robust mate-
rial, embodied, and evolutionary condition of possibility) the human 
of humanism.44 What we find “after” humanism as it were, is what we 
might call, turning Adorno’s famous phrase upside down, not the “pre-
ponderance of the object” but the “preponderance of the subject.” What 
I want to locate here, then, is a second crucial and indeed determina-
tive dimension in which the question of posthumanism is central.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Using posthuman theory and 
trauma studies, this essay argues that these three texts portray their respective posthuman subjects 
as trauma victims, and further that they demonstrate how the experience of trauma carries with it the 
potential to bridge the gap between human and posthuman through the act of bearing witness to one 
another’s trauma. Keywords: Science fiction, trauma studies, posthumanism, Frankenstein, Philip K. Dick, Ursula 
K.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Very simply, if there is ‘nothing outside the 
text’ is taken as an attentive description of human experience, then a posthuman 
philosophy attests to the world being everything. When nothing is overcome, 
everything arrives as part of posthuman experience, a connective, traversive, 
ecosophical ethics. Nonhumans are both posthuman as extra-discursive, but they 
are also part of their own textual worlds to which we are irreducibly alienated.",1

WHAT IS
POSTHUMANISM?",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"We 
need to understand that five hundred years of humanism may be coming to an end as 
humanism transforms itself into something that we must helplessly call post-humanism. Ihab Hassan, ""Prometheus as Perfonner: Towards a Posthumanist Culture?"" 
This book began with a roboticist's dream that struck me as a nightmare.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"What this means is that when we talk about posthumanism, we 
are not just talking about a thematics of the decentering of the human 
in relation to either evolutionary, ecological, or technological coordi-
nates (though that is where the conversation usually begins and, all 
too often, ends); rather, I will insist that we are also talking about how 
thinking confronts that thematics, what thought has to become in the 
face of those challenges.",1

Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"Yet, interestingly, although posthumanism as an intellectual move-
ment is marked by rather diverse lineages, the competing moralities
and seemingly opposed positions that shape its history share more in
common than they may realize or like to admit. In Scandalous
Knowledge: Science, Truth and the Human (2006), Barbara Herrnstein
Smith deftly captures the challenge posed by these varying intellectual
commitments.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"all this could help to 
elevate public discussion of genetics and transgenics to a more sophis-
ticated level.18
This is essentially the thrust as well of Kac’s own manifesto on trans-
genic art, but the artist takes the additional step there of insisting that 
“artists can contribute to increase global diversity by inventing new 
life forms,” and he imagines a day in the not too distant future when 
“the artist literally becomes a genetic programmer who can create life 
forms by writing or altering a given (genetic) sequence.”19
This insistence complicates an already complicated situation 
considerably, because it invites the sorts of trepidations rightly raised 
by critics such as Steve Baker, who writes that Kac “engages with the 
animal through techniques that strike many people as meddlesome, 
invasive, and profoundly unethical.”20 It’s not that any of the animals 
used in his work are harmed (they aren’t, and Kac has repeatedly made 
it clear how seriously he takes his responsibility for the care and well-
­being of the animals involved) but rather that “Kac seems to overlook 
the larger picture,” as Baker puts it: namely, that his work depends on 
and in a fundamental sense reproduces an entire set of institutions and 
practices of scientific research that subject millions of animals a year to 
distressing, often painful, and usually fatal experimentation, a subjec-
tion of nonhuman beings of “unprecedented proportions,” as Derrida 
puts it, in which “traditional forms of treatment of the animal have 
been turned upside down” and replaced by “an artificial, infernal, vir-
tually interminable survival, in conditions that previous generations 
would have judged monstrous.”21
Such concerns are very important, of course, but I don’t want to 
pursue them further here—­in part because they have received ample 
air time in the discussions of Kac’s work, but primarily because cer-
tain habitual oversimplifications endemic to addressing those concerns 
have tended to mask crucial aspects of Kac’s work, features that have 
a less obvious and thematic relation to how his projects ethically in-
tervene in our received views of the human/animal relationship and,
from dead meat to glow-in-the-dar k bunnies
beyond that, in the question of posthumanism generally.",1

The term “posthumanism” itself seems to have worked its way 
into contemporary critical discourse in the humanities and social sci-
ences during the mid-­1990s, though its roots go back, in one genealogy, 
at least to the 1960s and pronouncements of the sort made famous by 
Foucault in the closing paragraph of The Order of Things: An Archaeology 
of the Human Sciences, where he writes that the historical appearance of 
this thing called “man” was not
the transition into luminous consciousness of an age-­old concern, the 
entry into objectivity of something that had long remained trapped 
within beliefs and philosophies: it was the effect of a change in the 
fundamental arrangements of knowledge.",1
Posthumanism,hasDefinition,"“When Moravec imagines ‘you’ choosing to 
download yourself into a computer, thereby obtaining through techno-
logical mastery the ultimate privilege of immortality,” Hayles writes, 
“he is not abandoning the autonomous liberal subject but is expanding 
its prerogatives into the realm of the posthuman.”10 Hayles is no doubt 
right, and though she is quick to add that “the posthuman need not 
be recuperated back into liberal humanism, nor need it be construed 
as anti-­human,” the net effect and critical ground tone of her book, as 
many have noted, are to associate the posthuman with a kind of trium-
phant disembodiment.11 Hayles’s use of the term, in other words, tends 
to oppose embodiment and the posthuman, whereas the sense in which 
I am using the term here insists on exactly the opposite: posthumanism 
in my sense isn’t posthuman at all—­in the sense of being “after” our 
embodiment has been transcended—­but is only posthumanist, in the 
sense that it opposes the fantasies of disembodiment and autonomy, 
inherited from humanism itself, that Hayles rightly criticizes.",1
Posthumanism,hasExample,"(I suggest, for example, that if you are interviewing with the local 
newspaper about animal overpopulation in your community and you 
want to win over readers to your point of view, you would do well 
to gravitate toward the internal disciplinary discourse that character-
izes the humanist end of the spectrum.) In this view, the designation 
“humanist posthumanism” would apply as well, as I have argued else-
where, to the Kantian animal rights philosophy of Tom Regan, the 
utilitarian animal liberation position of Peter Singer, or the capabilities 
approach of Martha Nussbaum in Frontiers of Justice.50 Meanwhile, at 
the diagonally opposed corner of this schema, “posthumanist human-
ism” would consist of being posthumanist in internal disciplinarity, 
but humanist in the continued external insistence on the ethical and, 
broadly speaking, ontological efficacy of the human/animal divide.",1

 Posthumanism, the story often goes, needs no theorizing. How
 could it?",1
Posthumanism,hasReference,"If we keep in mind that theatricality de-
pends first and foremost on spatial distribution, we can appreciate the 
resonance of Derrida’s comment, invoked in my earlier discussions, for 
Kac’s attempt—­and the ethics of that attempt—­to situate the visual in 
ways that fundamentally trouble how we have typically indexed the 
(human) animal sensorium to the human/animal ontological divide: 
that “space isn’t only the visible, and moreover the invisible”—­an in­
visible that is itself “not simply the opposite of vision.”32 In this light, 
we can see more clearly—­or perhaps I should say more “obliquely”—­
how Kac’s theatricalization of visuality doesn’t evade the viewer’s “fini-
tude” and “humanness” (as Fried would have it) but rather underscores 
it, in the specifically posthumanist sense that the field of meaning and 
experience is no longer thought to be exhausted by the self-­reference of 
a particularly, even acutely, human visuality.33
In the end, then, the contrast between Sue Coe and Eduardo Kac 
helps us to see, in the realm of art, the difference between two differ-
ent kinds of posthumanism that correspond to the distinction drawn 
at the end of chapter 4: a humanist posthumanism and a posthumanist 
one.",1
Posthumanism,hasReference,"In reference to the Romantic turn in posthumanism, once again time emerges 
as an issue, and the time and geography of various movements create their own 
SroduFtiYe ruStures and fissures. $nne :einstone¶s Avatar Bodies (2004) is one 
of the many posthuman texts which exploits the mobility of the concept to bring 
in seemingly unrelatable elements – here ancient Eastern ideology or theology 
– to create what she calls an esoteric and exoteric spiritual posthumanism.",1
Posthumanism,hasReference,"This may be what 
is (falsely) called “relativism,” but it is also what, under the conditions 
of modernity, is called “knowledge.”
Crucial to a posthumanist understanding of disciplinarity, then—­
and to posthumanism in general, I would argue—­is the fundamental 
principle of “openness from closure” that Luhmann’s work helps us 
theorize: that taking seriously the phenomena of self-­reference and au-
topoietic closure in disciplinary systems leads not to solipsism but, quite 
the contrary, to the ability for the system to increase environmental 
contacts and, in the process, produce more environmental complexity 
for other systems, which in turn challenges other disciplines to change 
and evolve if they want to remain resonant with their changing envi-
ronment.",1
